## Main Features

The DIY Home Improvement Assistant features a **simple Streamlit user interface** that allows users to ask any home improvement–related question.  

**Workflow:**
1. **Retrieval:**  
   The system retrieves relevant context from a pre-indexed dataset containing DIY-related information.
2. **Answer Generation:**  
   The user’s question, along with the retrieved context, is sent to a **local large language model (LLM)** hosted via **LM Studio**.
3. **Response Output:**  
   The LLM generates a textual answer that provides clear, step-by-step instructions or descriptive guidance.
4. **Reference Integration:**  
   Below each generated answer, the application displays **five YouTube video links** that serve as visual references for the topic.

## System Architecture & Workflow

The app integrates several key components to provide an intelligent, retrieval-augmented experience:

- 🧠 **Local LLM (LM Studio)** — generates textual answers from retrieved context.  
- 🔍 **MinSearch Index** — indexes and retrieves relevant sections from the dataset.  
- 💬 **Streamlit Interface** — allows users to submit questions easily.  
- 🐳 **Dockerized Application** — ensures consistent and portable setup across systems.

**Workflow overview:**
1. User enters a question through the Streamlit UI (e.g., “How to fix a leaking faucet?”).  
2. The question is used to query the **MinSearch** index for the most relevant context.  
3. The question and retrieved context are sent to the **local LLM**.  
4. The LLM generates an answer — textual instructions with **five reference YouTube links**.

## Dataset

The app relies on a curated dataset of **YouTube transcripts** focused on home improvement and renovation topics.
