And first i want to let you know a little safety note we're working with high voltage electric the same thing that you have in your own home whenever you work with electricity make sure it's turned off i don't want you to get electrocuted three-way switches can be found in many homes. And they're very useful they allow you to control a light or maybe several lights from two different locations. But the problem is they look a lot different than a regular switch a three-way switch,https://youtu.be/LDyvcM0gcVs?t=0,"['What are three-way switches used for?', 'How do three-way switches work?', 'Can anyone install three-way switches?', 'Are three-way switches commonly found in homes?', 'What safety precautions should be taken when working with high voltage electricity?']"

And three plus the green grounding screw. But this black screw right here that's the really important one that we need to pay attention to a regular single pulse switch has just got two screws on it. And the green grounding screw you can see how it's very different from a three-way switch that's where the trouble begins that third wire can cause three-way switches not to work properly if you put the wires on the wrong screws i've built this little,https://youtu.be/LDyvcM0gcVs?t=42,"['What is the difference between a regular single pulse switch and a three-way switch?', 'How many screws does a three-way switch have?', 'Why is the grounding screw important for three-way switches?', 'Can three-way switches work properly if the third wire is not connected correctly?', 'What happens when you put the wrong wires on the wrong screws in a three-way switch?']"

So you can see how they work you'll never find two three-way switches this close together in real life. But here's how they work look down here you'll find this yellow wire this is where the power comes into the first three-way switch. Now notice there's a white wire that's a little thicker that leaves this switch goes over. And drops down into the second switch boox. And look what happens out of that switchbox is another yellow wire that goes up. And feeds the light that's the basic wiring diagram. And the most simplistic way to wire a three-way switch. Now let me show you the types of wire that we use to do that here are the two wires that i'm,https://youtu.be/LDyvcM0gcVs?t=81,"['What type of wire is used for the power input in a three-way switch?', 'How does the white thicker wire connect to the second switch box?', 'What happens when the yellow wire from the first switch feeds into the second switch?', 'Why can you never find two three-way switches this close together in real life?', 'What is the most simplistic way to wire a three-way switch?']"

And of course the bare copper is the ground. But look at this one this has four conductors it's got the black white bare copper. But this extra red wire this comes in really handy when you're working with three-way switches we're going to take the switches apart right. Now so i can show you how all of these wires work together to make the lights go on and,https://youtu.be/LDyvcM0gcVs?t=124,"['What are the typical types of wires used for home wiring?', 'How do three-way switches use four conductors?', 'What is the purpose of a bare copper wire in electrical wiring?', 'Why is an extra red wire useful when working with three-way switches?', 'How do the white, black, and neutral wires work together to power lights?']"

And off oh look at this jumble of wires in here i know you're confused. But look how simple this really is remember this yellow wire has got a black wire which is the hot that's the one that's coming from your service panel it's got a white wire that's the neutral. And of course it's got the bare copper wire. And this white wire had the same three wires plus it had a red wire. Now look how they all actually hook up the white wires the neutral wires they need to just be wire nutted together because that's sending the neutral directly up to the light bulb that's what you want it to do the only wires that need to connect to the three-way switch are the black wires. And that red wire. Now the ground wire same thing the ground wires are just twisted together. And of course one of the wires attaches to the ground screw on the actual three-way switch that means. Now we're only left with three wires. Now look at this here is that black screw on the three-way switch i was telling you about. And this black wire actually is the hot wire that comes from the circuit breaker panel it connects to the black screw. And the black. And red wire that are in this white wire that goes between the two three-way switches you can hook them to either one of the brass screws on the three-way switch it doesn't make any difference at all. Now let's go look at the other switch. So we can see how that one's wired h okay here's the second three-way switch i'm going to pull it apart. And i'm going to show you the wires in this one. And you're going to find out something very amazing it looks identical to the first three-way switch check this out here are the two black wires. And the red wire. And of course the grounding wires. And then back in here are the other two neutrals that were wi nuted together. So what's happening we've got power that's eventually going to come in through this white wire. And it's going to come into either the red wire or the black wire. And then it's going to leave the top of the switch through this black wire which is actually inside the yellow one. And go right up to the light to make it work it's that simple. So let's look at this switch one more time okay here is the second three-way switch notice here on the silver screw here's one of the black wires. And here is the red wire that's going through this white wire back to the other 3a switch here is the black screw or the common. And that black wire goes up to the light through the yellow wire here of course is our two neutrals that are wire nuted together. And of course the ground screw. And the ground wire are connected together right here at the bottom of the switch you probably feel like a master,https://youtu.be/LDyvcM0gcVs?t=162,"['What type of wires do three-way switches use?', 'How do white wires connect to three-way switches?', 'Why do black and red wires need to be connected to brass screws?', 'What happens when power comes into a three-way switch?', 'How are neutrals connected in a three-way switch?']"

Now that you've understood three-way switches remember keep the power off at your home let's summarize very quickly the black screw on the three-way switches only connect the wire from the panel the hot wire to it or the wire that goes up to the light the other two brass screws you hook the travelers to it those were the black.

And i'm back here from host improvements.com. And in today's video it's more of an informative video  showing you  what i' consider to be kind of  one of the better ways to insulate your basement walls  obviously i think probably spray foam is probably would be the number one way to do it  unfortunately the cost of it  a lot of people can't can't afford to do it that way. So this would be kind of what i would consider to be the next best thing. And it's it's a little bit of a hybrid of of foam. And bad insulation. So so you've obviously got you know bare concrete wall right you've either demoed your basement or maybe it was never developed. So you've got a a concrete wall this just happens to been painted at one time. But so bare concrete then,https://youtu.be/cCFFuL4J0jQ?t=0,"['What is the recommended method for insulating basement walls?', 'Why is spray foam insulation considered the number one option?', 'What are some alternatives to spray foam insulation?', 'How does hybrid insulation work?', 'What is a bare concrete wall and how is it typically prepared for insulation?']"

But so bare concrete. Then what i would do is attach rigid foam usually 1 in rigid foam interlocking styrofoam to the wall rate to the concrete wall seal all the joints of that foam anywhere that needs to be sealed to to create a barrier. So this does two things it gives you some r value in this case 1 in  usually gives you r5 with most brands. And it actes your moisture barrier as well okay. So we have other videos as far as how to attach this. And talking about moisture barriers. And that sort of thing. So if you need some more information on that just check for those videos okay.

So you've you've installed the rigid foam. And it's all sealed up. Then you're going to frame your walls  i i like to use for my bottom plate i like to use a bluewood framing or pressure treated even because it is in contact with the concrete floor okay. So your bottom plate i usually stick frame because i find in basements you know the floor is up. And down a little bit. And by stick framing i mean i'll attach my bottom plate. And my top plates. And i'll measure every stud. And cut each one to fit. And then toenail them in toenailing them in is firing a nail or a screw on an angle from the side through the stud. So it would come through like this. And down into the plate. Now you've heard me preach many times about not using screws to frame this is not structural framing this isn't holding your house up screws would be perfectly fine here i i've chosen to nail this. But you could use deck screws here without any issues  if you're using a pressure treated bottom plate or or pressure treated lumber you'd want to make sure you're using the acq screws though okay.

So you' frame your wall  electrician would come in run all their electrical  you know if there happen to be some plumbing or whatever anyways the other trades would run what they needed to run. Then then you could install bad insulation whatever brand or type that you choose to do. So it would get installed. And then. Then finally after that after that's all done. Then you're going to need to use a vapor barrier as well okay. So it would go on this one isn't completed it's not all sealed. But it would go on.

But we need a shelf right here that we can fold laundry on. But we're not going to use it all the time. So we need something that can fold down when we don't need it. And fold up when we do need it. And we're going to do that with this a folding shelf bracket. Now in order for these to work they need to be drilled into the studs. So it can hold the weight of the tabletop.

Now normally countertops are anywhere from 34 to 36 in. And for this it's really just a preference we're going to be folding laundry. So i think we want it a little bit higher than that somewhere around this area. And actually this mark i made for the stud is probably about really where i want it.

And that is the top of the second bracket okay i'm i'm pre-drilling the holes here just to make it a little easier driving in the screws i mean not like i want to do laundry. But i can in a few minutes okay. Now that the brackets are installed we can think about what to put on top. And there are a lot of different materials you can use a piece of butcher block you can get a piece of melamine like this it's a nice finish. And in my case i decided to make my own i had some extra wood. So i built this. And it just fits on like that. And all we have to do is attach it from underneath.

And in today's video we're visiting the cabin build. And we're going to have a look at all the ruffin plumbing in the basement floor before the floor gets poured. And also the ruff in for  radon mitigation  which is code here in my area. So we've got to put some radon  some pipe in the the floor under the radon rock just in case we have an issue down the road. So right,https://youtu.be/WC1QwaPQvEY?t=0,"['What was the purpose of visiting the cabin build?', ""Who is the speaker in today's video?"", 'What type of mitigation system will be installed?', 'Why is radon mitigation necessary?', 'Where does radon rock typically occur?']"

So right here this black pipe that you see this  4in block abs could be pvc  this is for our rate on  mitigation if we ever need it. So in our area it's required to be put in in new homes  whether you need it or not. So that it's there in the future if the need arises. So basically it needs to just extend out to the middle of the of the basement area there's no cap on the end or anything. And if  raon gas becomes a problem  it can be  sucked out with a fan a proper fan. And ducked it outside. So this pipe gets buried under the under the floor we use this rock this radon rock just kind of 1 in to half inch sort of rock. And that allows any gas that's in there it can move around below the slab. So this will get completely covered in the rock. Then before they pour the floor they're going to lay some poly sheeting. And seal it up. And seal it to to the walls put the rebar in. And pour the floor. But anyways we we've got this in here. So in future if we ever need it. So what i did is i put the 4 in in it's pretty basic there's no real grading needed or anything it just needs to be underneath this rock. And then i brought it up vertically here in the corner you can see i've got a cap glued on the end here. But if we ever need it we can cut this cap off extend the pipe  install our fan. And it would go out. And and  be vented right outside. So i put it in this corner just because our utility room was too full of stuff. And you'll see in a minute there's a lot of plumbing other actual plumbing pipes in the floor. And it was just too busy to do all this. So i brought it up over here we're we're going to have the electrical panel in this corner of this bedroom anyways. So i'll be building an enclosure around that this will just get enclosed simply inside of there as well.

Now the next thing we've got is all our plumbing rough in. So in this in this general area well in this area is the  basement bathroom. And pretty much directly above it is going to be the  main floor bathroom. So you can see here what we've got over here is  this actually has to get changed cuz it's going to be a wet vent. So that needs to be changed to 2 in this pipe that comes down here. And it slips along the back. And comes over here. And ties in  right there anyways plumbers coming back out to change that to 2 in. But you get the basic idea. So this this vent this pipe here is going to work as a wet vent for the vanity sinks. So if you can imagine it's going to go up into the  main floor get above flood plane which is you know above your vanity counter. And it'll tie back into the main vent which is what this one will be in the wall beside it. And then the two vanity sinks will drain into that it will. Then flow around. And it dumps in right here which is the same place that the basement shower is going to tie in. And then into the 3-in drain okay. So our main vent our main vent is this one. So it'll be 3 in going all the way up through the first story. And through the roof. And through the attic. But it comes down here. And it converts into 4 in once it gets below the floor. So it'll follow around out here. Then it goes out. And what you see right here is back flow preventer. So this is a an always closed that's how it's classified backflow preventor which basically means there's a little flapper in there i don't want to take this apart cuz he's got a pressure tested again. So i'd rather leave it  the way it is. But there's basically a flapper in there. And it it always sits closed until fluid which is always supposed to flow this way will come. And open it up. And it'll allow it to go out. And under the foundation. And out to our septic tank which is out going to be outside this this setup on here is just. So that when i back fill the rock. And they pour the concrete  they can pull that up to the level it needs to be. And it keeps the concrete back. So that we will always have access i can get this open down through this hole okay we ever have to get out that. So so anyway. So yeah our main main goes out. And to the septic okay. Now other things that are tying into this is this is a floor drain it's going to be a floor drain in the utility room this whole this whole area here is going to be utility room i know it's hard to visualize right. Now but. So floor drain it also this is a new rural inar area it also has a back flow. So this is another one of those same valves it's just that it's a 3in cuz it's in a in a line coming off the main line. So that's same thing in there. So it has its own always shut  back flow which in this case the flow here is always going to be there's a p trap down below here it's always going to be out this way right cuz it's dumping into the main. And leaving. So the back flows in here like this. Now we've we've fed a condensate line drain right here this will be for the hvr. So it'll  drip any condensate moisture it has into here. And it actually works  in a couple ways. So it comes through the floor drain. And through the floor drain's trap. And because it's not a big amount of water  we can drain it into there. And it what it does is it actually keeps that p trap  from drying out cuz a lot of times on a for drain you'll get some sewer gas coming back cuz your  your pe trap under the floor drain dries out right cuz it's not too often they get need to be used or get water in them okay. So the condensate will drip in there. And kind of keep that better chance of keeping that floor drain p trap  always sealed up if you ever notice su gas smell in your in your basement or whatever. And you've got a floor drain go dump  a gallon of water down that. And it'll likely  dissipate. And go away. And just fill your p trap back up again. Now this pipe right here this stand pipe is a 2in stand pipe that eventually our kitchen sink from up on the main floor will drain into. And you can see it will drain down that pipe off. And into the main. And and gone to the septic as we move a little further back here this is our  our toilet in the basement. So it basically  pretty self-explanatory  you flush the toilet sewage will run in the 3-in pipe here all the way out it this 3-in picks up the shower. And the upstairs vanities. But it it flows out. And into the main. And then out to the tank. And again we had to put another back flow this isn't always closed again we had to do another one on this  on this 3in line. So it seems a little  redundant. But i guess  you got to follow the rules right. So so that's the main  main gist. Now up on the main floor. So this is this was our 3-in or sorry our 4in main down here in the ground. And it turns into a 3-in stack in the wall that's going to go right out of the right out of the cabin. And up at the main floor our  main floor toilet will will dump into that. So okay. So you can see it's got a clean out on this back side right there. So that'll allow us to go you know if we ever have to snake the main drain or anything that'll allow that to be done outside i'll just show you where the main drain comes out under the footing. And eventually we'll get hooked to the tank. So i'm standing on the basement wall right. Now here's all our plumbing here's a good overhead shot of all that there's the radon here's all our plumbing in the floor here. And then it goes out as you can see right here. And goes under the footing heading to the tank. So over on this side that's where it comes out you can see it there it's got an orange test cap on the end down there right there. And when they put our tank in which will be right here they will  connect the tank to that i,https://youtu.be/WC1QwaPQvEY?t=142,"['What is a wet vent, and how does it work?', 'How does a backflow preventor function?', 'What is the purpose of a p-trap in plumbing?', 'Can you explain the difference between a 3-in and 4-in main line?', 'How do condensate lines drain into the septic tank?']"

And i want to show you how to use a belt sander to take the finish off of a piece of furniture or a piece of wood the problem that i have right. Now is that it's about 47° outside we were thinking about using a chemical stripper to do the job. But guess what the instructions on the chemical stripper say temperature should be between 60. And 80° well i got to get the job done. So we're going to treat this the same way that you might treat refinishing a hardwood floor when you think about it all that a contractor does that sands hardwood floors he just uses that machine. And he just uses different grits of sandpaper let's get started right.

So you know of course here's where you know the finish hasn't been touched yet. And we're down to bare wood right here. And that was only after about 10 or 12 seconds. So what we've got to do. Now to finish the job is just basically do the entire top  do everything with a first pass with that 60 grit paper. And then start switching out with different sandpapers 80 grit 120 grit you know finer. And finer.

Now we all know that heat rises. And in a home it tends to collect near the ceiling when you do this what you're doing is pulling cooler air up from the floor displacing that hot air at the ceiling. And pushing it back down to where we are. Now the rer company has going on one better they've actually incorporated a heater in the fan unit there are four ceramic heating units up here as the air is pulled up it passes over the heating elements heat is added. And then that air is pushed back down into the living area.

I'm more of a beer guy, i would say. But what i really love are very interesting wine racks. I've always wanted to build like one of those ones you put on the wall that holds maybe, you know, three or four bottles of wine that you use. Now and again. So, i thought today we could build a very simple version of a wine rack. And it involves some of your creativity. The design that i came up with is very simple. And it's actually rustic. And that creativity part i was just talking about comes in the form of you beating up this wood. We're going to put dings. And dents in it to really make it look old. And age the wood. Now, the wood i chose is just regular old pine. You can use whatever you want. And the first thing we're going to do is actually cut these pieces of wood to length. Now, the length that i came up with is based on literally lining up four bottles of wine. And coming up with that number. So, let's go out.

So, let's go out. And cut these right now. The weather was pretty nice,. So i decided to  do my work outside. You can see that this wood is tongue. And groove. I'm using it for the back of the wine rack,. And it's just a design choice. So, we'll measure to 18 1/2 in. I'm cutting these pieces at the same time with my miter saw. That way i'm assured they're all the same length. And it saves time. Here i'm using an adjustable square to make sure the ends are nice. And flush. Then i'll use this handy onboard clamp to hold everything in place while i cut. Now, if your miter saw doesn't have one, any clamp will do. It's just much safer to clamp it down than to just hold it with your hands. By the way, if you don't have any of these power tools i'm using, most home centers will do all the cutting for you. Next, it's time to cut out what will become the side pieces. And the shelf. Now, unlike the tongue. And groove material i'm using for the back, these are just flat pieces of 1x5 pine. I'm also making one extra piece. I always like to have this just in case i want to change the design or in case i make a mistake. Now it's time to head over to the table saw because the shelf that will actually hold the wine has to be a little bit narrower than the width of the wood i bought. So i'll cut it to width, otherwise known as ripping the wood. [music] now, it's always a good idea to use a push stick like this homemade one i'm using to push the wood through rather than risk getting your hands too close to the [music] blade. Okay,. Now comes the fun part.

Okay,. Now comes the fun part. We get to beat up the wood. Now, to do that, we're going to grab some tools. You can really use anything you want. I don't know. I'm going to grab i think just a screwdriver is good. You know, a hammer. I like let's do an all. I really like using this all for some holes. And. Then we just come over. And we just really just go to town on it. There's really no right or wrong way. [music] [music] okay, we have one more thing left to do,. And that is to drill a couple holes because i'm going to be using brass in our wine rack. And the brass is actually going to go in here,. And it's going to act as a little barrier. So that the wine doesn't fall out. So, we need to drill those two holes. Now, i want to make sure both of these holes are perfectly vertical. To do that, i'm going to use this drill guide,. And this will give us a nice vertical hole that will go through both pieces of wood. This is a this is an older one,. But it will still do the [music] job. Here are the marks for the two holes. And much like i did when i was cutting the wood, i'm stacking them on top of each other because i need two perfectly aligned sets of holes in each of these pieces, which are actually the sides. So, i'll line them up, clamp everything down,. And drill. Now, if you don't have one of these drill guides, you can just do it freehand. And use a square to make sure you're nice. And vertical. Okay.

Okay. The next step, start staining. And because we're using stain here, i'm going to put down some craft paper to protect the workbench. And put on some rubber gloves. Now, i'm using a water-based stain for a few reasons. One, it dries pretty quick,. And two, there aren't as many fumes as you'd get with an oilbased stain. As always, make sure you stir the stain well before you use it. To apply the stain, i'm just using a rag,. But you could use a foam brush, too. The reason i'm doing it before i assemble it is because this wood will inevitably expand. And contract due to changes in the humidity,. And when it shrinks, i don't want any unstained wood showing, especially here on the tongue of the wood i'm using for the back. Now, the most important part with the method of making the wood look old is to make sure the stain gets deep into all those dense, stings,. And holes we made earlier. So, really make sure it soaks in. And then follow with long strokes to blend it in. And remove any excess stain. When it dries, these areas will be darker than the surrounding wood, giving it the effect we want. I'm applying stain to all sides of the wood to make it uniform looking. And here i waited a bit to let it dry before flipping them over to do the back sides. Okay, the staining is. Now done. We'll wait about an hour. And then we'll come back.

Okay, after a nice lunch, it looks like everything is good. And dry. Now i can get rid of the paper. So we can get to work. So, we've got the extra piece, which we'll push aside, the shelf, the two sides,. And of course, the three pieces of tongue. And groove that will make up the back. I'm going to kind of dry assemble it here. We've got the back, the sides,. And of course, the shelf. Now, the reason i'm dry assembling it is because i want to get an exact measurement for the brass rods that will fit into the holes i made earlier. So, i'll just position one end. And mark the other. Brass is really soft,. So i can easily use a hacksaw to cut right through it. I like these smaller hacksaws for cutting small material like this. It just makes it easier to manage. Now, you'll get some sharp edges on the cut,. So i like to smooth them. And 60 grit sandpaper does the trick. Okay,. Now we can start the assembly. The first step is to put the back, the tongue. And groove part together. The tongue just slides right into the groove of the piece next to it. And sometimes, you know, takes a little extra love to get the pieces to fit together. The next step is to position the shelf. Now, in my case, i'm going to keep it up about 3 in from the bottom. I like leaving this area underneath here in case you want to hang wine openers or other accessories. I'll clamp it together to hold everything. And with this speed square, i can check to make sure the shelf is nice. And square with the back. And the sides. And a few taps of the hammer helps it along. Now, we can flip it on its side. I'm using glue. And screws to put this together. But before i bring in the glue, i'm going to pre-drill all the holes to help prevent the wood from splitting. And i'm using our good old friend, the all for this, just because it's easier to see than a pencil mark. We're screwing into just 3/4 in thick wood,. So i really need to be precise where i drill the holes. The next step, pre-drill with this counter syninking bit. And our speed square comes back for a little more help. This time to line up my holes for the shelf. The next step is to carefully remove the clamps. Take the side pieces off. And add my glue. This is just regular wood [music] glue. Now, it's just a matter of putting the side back in position. And driving in the screws. I'm using screws that sort of look like brass just to match with the brass rod. Speaking of the brass rods,. Now we can slide them into place. They fit snugly,. So friction should hold them [music] in. A few taps of the hammer. And we're done. Now, you don't necessarily have to put wine in here. You can use anything that's in a bottle that you use on a regular basis. But whatever you put in here, make sure that when you hang this, you drill directly into studs because this definitely does have some weight to it.

So what i was originally thinking to open the floor was if we could interrupt the pipe here. And bring it across. And then come down we can use this straight to the toilet. And run off of it to go to the sink does that work give or take this one just goes to the floor drain by the way that's it okay okay that river something like that'll work yeah we need something yeah okay. So we got a hole over there for the wet vent for those sink all right. And then we're just gonna come up to the ceiling we're gonna do a box. So when you doing your venting if you come to here run a line over there. And just cap it for you okay droplet yeah we're gonna drop the ceiling. And rerun all this. So we just bring a line over there underneath the joist that way i have room to bring out my exhaust for the dryer. And all that right yeah that's my center line for the toilet okay that's one we're doing ikea one. Now okay sink right there. So that's why it's the really off center there's a little stupid ikea drinks yeah yeah. And this one's just center. So like i said we'll work a foot off we're gonna build an actual wall. So i've got three. And a half. And then send around the 36 by 4 foot this tie into this or we're gonna do something different it's a long you're gonna be surface mounted or behind that i'm gonna look anything we're thinking of actually running that over here because we're gonna do a 2x6 wall okay all the way down the side. And then we're thinking i've just taken this that two-inch that's inch. And a half that's the dream is a quick clean-out is it yeah yeah go from there yeah. So work yep beautiful. So whether this is six or seven inches whatever we need to facilitate that will make it work tells you all right. And then like i said because these are all connected from the clean on over there we'll have access for legal reasons. But we'll probably do any of our snake training from over there yeah all right. So all we're doing is bringing those three new items onto this line the liner will take off with us cleaning. And then we're good perfect sweet that's good cap into it counter quarter there well there's all your water route i guess they put the damn brick in the wrong spot [music] all right. So the plumbers all finished his work we got lucky with some space we didn't have to redirect the whole line like we talked about originally. So that worked out well. So what he did is he uses these fantastic rubber clamp systems where he has a fitting. And he adds a little stem ik pipe on each side cuts the existing line it takes the rubber fitting rolls it back sticks this in place pulls it back over clamps it on boom instantly tied into the plumbing without having to raise the line or move everything around it's brilliant. So it makes this kind of work real simple. So although it looks very daunting he was in. And out of here in about a half an hour he put him her new tee for the toilet was able to tie right in there without adjusting the original line. And then brought my sink line again off of a tee why here it's a two-inch line because at this point building code requires this to be a wet vent. So this is bringing air for the sink as well as the drain okay. So this is also bringing air for the toilet.

And it tightens up the adapter one of the things i like about these tools is that they come in different sizes. And different power levels for example this is for the really serious contractor or serious do yourselfer it's 18 volts you can actually even get one potentially that's 24 volts. But for those of you who just do maybe weekend projects on a monthly basis or. So you may find that the 14.4 volt model is good enough it's lighter weight it fits those people who have smaller hands really well.

And we're ready to begin installing the beams the beams are first measured to length. And marked. Then a square line is drawn around all three sides the easiest. And fastest way to cut the beams is with a power miter saw since most saw blades are not large enough to cut through a beam of this size in one pass we'll need to make individual cuts on three sides the beams can of course also be cut with a handsaw using a similar procedure these beams have come unfinished. So we'll paint them before putting them up a foam roller works well for this [applause] a quick side note here if the beams are cut slightly longer than needed they can easily be trimmed back using a sander [music] because the perimeter beams are right up against the wall we'll need to attach the wall edges by first applying a bead of construction adhesive the beam is slipped over the rails.

Now we remove the final strips of blue tape quick grab adhesive is applied to the back of the ceiling tiles in quarter-sized dollops spaced every six to eight inches. Now this part can be done working alone. But i find it goes much faster with two people one applying the adhesive the other placing the tiles in position while the adhesive grabs. And holds quickly it also allows the tile to be slid sideways for final positioning the tiles are placed adjacent to each other.

And i want to talk a little bit about a really great saw stand  this is a device it's a tool it's really an accessory that you would use to mount a well it could be just about any saw. But in in most cases it's a miter boox saw. And frequently carpenters will use a saw stand you know out in the field  in your driveway  where ever they need to set up a saw. And they are extremely helpful if you want to keep the saw stable which is very important. And more importantly if you're cutting long lengths of wood. So let's look at a saw stand that i'm using right. Now and. And it's got to be one of the the best engineered tool accessories i've seen in my career i i'll be very honest with you because if if you if you knew how we used to have to set up saws in the old days before this accessory is developed  you you'd have the same feelings i would let's take a look at it right,https://youtu.be/QuTawyipmT4?t=0,"['What is a saw stand and its primary function?', 'Why are saw stands commonly used by carpenters?', 'How do saw stands contribute to stability when cutting long lengths of wood?', 'What types of saws are most frequently mounted on a saw stand?', 'What benefits does the author believe saw stands bring compared to traditional methods of setting up saws?']"

Now so here's the stand you can see it doesn't you might not think it looks like much. And it's  you know made out of aluminum it's got these nice folding legs. And i've got it set up on a nice stable plywood floor. But here are some really. And of course here's the saw. So you can put it into perspective you can see that you've got a you know a a miter box saw. And it happens to be a compound one that's attached you know to the stand. And the way it attaches by the way are these nice yellow brackets these yellow brackets come with the saw stand. And they have got  slots in them that you really can't see well actually you can see the slot right here. And it comes with a bolt kit. And just about any saw  any any miner box saw will will fit on on this saw stand on these brackets. So and. Then of course you can move the  these brackets. And slide the saw up. And down the saw stand by squeezing you know those those clamps that's what locks it into place. But here's one of the greatest features about this particular saw stand these are end supports. And of course they slide in. And out. And they slide a long long way you can see that it extends out from the stand. And what allows you to do is the lumber that the height of this part of the bracket right here well guess what it's the same height as the table of the saw. So it keeps your lumber nice. And level as you cut it you can make adjustments on this. So that using these little knobs here that that allow you to raise or lower this part of the support. And what that allows you to do you can make this become as high as the table. So that if you're trying to cut lumber that's the same length all the time this becomes the stop in other words the lumber hits against here. And whatever distance you have created you know for this away from the saw you can see i can move it any direction i want. And then you can lock it into place using this lever here. So this will not move the point is is that it's a huge timesaver because once you preset this to whatever distance it is away from the blade you can cut multiple pieces of lumber the exact same length every time you only have to measure it once. And it saves a lot a lot of time  the stand is very very stable  it is  you can also adjust where you want the saw on the stand you know you can put it to the left to the right to the middle. And of course this helps you when when you're cutting very very long lengths of lumber because if you want to balance the lumber. And you take this bracket all the way out you can see that bracket's way way out there. And of course you know the saw is right here. And we could even slide the saw maybe a little farther to the right the point is   you can cut very long lengths of lumber. And you know they won't be tipping you know they they'll be balanced when you're trying to sit here. And and do the work at the saw. So the saw stands are really really wonderful once you take the saw off  the legs collapse  there's a nice carrying handle underneath the saw stand. And it's just a remarkable tool just it's just an absolutely remarkable tool. And you know it says it right there tells you exactly what's going on. But it's just a great tool.

And the saw comes with its own pump that actually recirculates the water that's sitting in a pan. And it flows across the blade. And onto your tile keeping both of them cool as can be that's what's make sure that your blade lasts a long time the saw also can go up. And down. And it can tilt left.

And then one outlet. And then the second outlet. Now oddly enough this one comes with it's a 3/4 inch line for crimping or it's a/ inch piece of  male copper here. So that you could just put copper line right over top. And extend down to a tub or you can add that little stopper there with solder the other option you might want to try is a shark bite. But on further inspection we found that when you compress that on there as hard as it can go it doesn't allow for the interior of that valve to actually work. And it pops off without any don't use the shark bite on this valve well there's just not quite enough room  note to real bell pro if you want to make a modification. So that this valve is stem is a little bit longer than we could use our shark bite in this situation the back of this wall is a storage room we'd have access to it that'd be a perfectly legitimate,https://youtu.be/d4zcKBXGhgg?t=0,"['What type of valve is being installed?', 'How many outlets does the new riell pro line shower valve have?', 'What are the options for connecting copper line to the valve?', ""Why can't the shark bite be used on this specific valve?"", 'Where would you access the back of the wall for modification purposes?']"

So what we're going to do instead is we're going to open up this valve. And this is just a temporary thing here we're going to take that out because it's got  a rubber gasket on it. And we don't want to overheat it. So we're going to actually solder on our half inch copper cap okay. And so this is how we're going to do it we're going to do that first before we get into any of the construction because we want to give this time to cool off again before we handle it. Now at the hardware store you can buy a little soldering kit for dummies it's a pretty new stuff comes with solder comes with flux okay. So we're going to just light up up our torch really simple you'll hear the gas out of flame all right. So here we go. So what i do is i just set my torch on the ground we're on concrete if you're over top of any other kind of flooring put some protection down  when the solder drips out it's actually quite hot. And it can burn your flooring. So we're going to scratch out the inside of our cap just to create some grooves there where my solder can sit in. And get some flex paste we're going to just wipe that up. And that acid basically sets up that copper. So it's nice. And clean. So we're going to just heat where we want the solder to go. So we don't want to heat that part we want to heat over here cuz that's where we want the solder to go. So we put that in the flame. Now this gas in this system it's a little slower than a mps gas or a plumbous torch. And a settling torch we want to heat the copper to the point where we heat the copper. And the brass when the brass is hot enough over here that the solder melts oh there he goes starting to suck it up. And now i'm just going to push my solder rod right in the side. And when there's enough left over that it falls [music] out. Now we're done we just give it a bit of a wipe here we go. So when i'm doing a job like this i like to think ahead of myself. And i set up i know my have my water lines coming down my center line is going to be here it's really tight to get bring a water line down. And join it over. So i'm going to drill a hole bring the water from this side. So i'll just lay out my fittings make sure i got everything i need before i get started you have to pay attention here because you need something to mount this diverter on this valve body needs something. Now so the middle of this plastic line which is basically it tells you anywhere here okay that's where your wall needs to finish. So i'm going to set this back 3 in 2. And 1/2 in plus my wallboard. And i'll i'll be at 3 in finish plus tile i'll be great the way you set this is,https://youtu.be/d4zcKBXGhgg?t=77,"['What type of flooring should be protected when soldering?', 'How does a soldering torch work?', 'Why is it necessary to heat the brass before soldering?', 'What is flex paste used for in soldering?', 'What are some things to consider when setting up a water line for a diverter valve?']"

And this is where i need my hole for my water supply okay i would use this bit here is 3/4 it's plenty big enough. But because it's. So close. And so tight i'm going to give myself a little extra wiggle room using the self-feeding augur [music] bit. So really simple guys we're going to put our copper ring on the pipe.

And this is this wonderful little tool. Now you pull these back. And it opens it right up okay. And then it's a crimper as well. So once we got the crimper on position we'll turn the fitting. And then squeeze. Now there's a position on this handle like really stiff. And then once you get past the point of where it needs to be it just collapses on you. So again we can take that off has this wonderful little plate here. And it says go or no go it has the different dimensions 38 3/4 we're using half inch. So we're going to just see if that fits perfect you see neat eh that's how you measure it's little gauge to measure that your crimp is the right size awesome give ourselves that quarter inch okay. And c quick double check. And good to go okay. So now we got that one set up here we go. So now we have lots of line to play with we're going to cut it on the short side first get that ring installed. And then we'll make this a little bit shorter here we go put in our ring personally i find it easier to connect my plumbing before i mount [music] it again come by check your fitting with your gauges make sure it goes on nice okay i'm going to  install this supply line for all these guys on youtube are upset about the o-rings that i used before this system i mean yeah great it it seems like it works great has a nice compression. But this is a twohand operation. And these rings slide up. And down off the pcs way too easily. So you almost need a third hand to operate this thing. So this isn't just a simple shower valve. So it's not a valve with a shower head what we're putting on here is a adjustable slide bar. So we're going to have our hose attached to the shower head which releases off the slide bar comes down under. And over attaches to this drop here here. So now we got to get our water supply from here through the other side of the wood. And then down to this location i usually like to have it you know somewhere close. So that it hangs nice not a real big issue. So we got to drill another hole here we [music] go here we go [music] okay. Now using this testing gauge might seem a little monotonous. But this is a great way to find out if you missed locking one your joints.

So i got a few flooring screws here i'm going to use that to mount my drop here they're a lot stronger than drywall screws. And yet they don't stick out the other side. And cause any friction with my line when you're buying a system  like a rebel pro a lot of times you'll get the ruin or the valve body. And then a trim kit separate  you buy from from the building stores you get it all in the same box the roughing valve comes with this temporary plug very similar to a delta system. And if you don't have the finished kit when you install this. And you put it together this is great temporary fix right you screw that on. Now your watertight you can turn the pressure on. But now they're sharing that area with the hot. And the cold water line. And the hot water will win. So that heat will travel back up the cold water line. And presumably over to the toilet. And put hot water in your toilet. Then the toilet starts to sweat something fierce. And then your client calls you up. And says how come my toilet is making water all over the floor get the trim kit at the same time. And install the finished valve right away when you're done your entire job you might want to open it up again. And flush it just to make sure there's no debris in the line. So it's operating properly we're going to do is just check the paperwork real quick all right that was warranty finish valve yes it calls for a two installation okay one just slides over the other blah blah blah blah blah good all right. Now i'm not guessing it's pretty straightforward actually. But i just don't want to guess okay that lines up like that. And this lines up like that these two holes there okay it says you do fingertight. And then a quarter turn with a wrench meet the wrench. Now all that's left to do is to pressurize the lines make sure it's not dripping. And we can complete our wall installation. And our tiling. Then we'll come back.

And a 6ft wide version. So all you have to do is measure your door it'll be a little bit less than five or a little bit less than six when you measure it because they're measuring the total size of the jam inside the frame of the building. So if it's a five or a six you go to the store you get your corresponding screen. And then all you got to do is set your track on the wheels in your track position up top like that. And like that. And then come to the bottom. Now i'm going to get a little bit of help just for the sake of not driving myself crazy here. Now this door you want to get the wheel right on the track okay. So the top is in the bottom is in. Now i'm going to lift up. And my son is going to just make sure that that wheel is in the right position we good y okay. Then i'm going to use my screwdriver. And instead of prying i'm just going to pass underneath it. And it lifts the wheel. And i'm going to find that sweet spot. And then i'm going to just give it a bit of a lift over the bump. And then set it down. Now these wheels are springloaded. And so.

So they don't rust okay. And they can get dinged up out of shape pretty easy just get a little hammer small metal tool straighten your track back out we have some damage here this is a bit of a groove it's going to affect the long-term performance of the door. But here we're getting a brand new screen door door is probably a 5 to 10 year solution if you want to change the whole door you can. And then you're back up to a 20-year solution. But this is only $100. And very economical spray down. Now you can use wd40 you can use graphite you can use lithium silicone sprays any kind of lubricant that works with the weather that you're dealing with you'll be fine. And just make sure that it closes here we are. Now the last thing we have to do this particular door here has a a gasket here keep weather. And critters out. And because we've adjusted the height for the 76 inch height this needs to be cut down. So it'll fit nicely in a position if i leave it like this it'll start peeling away over time. And we don't want that. So you can use a knife or snips we're just going to give that a bit of a tuck. And then we're good that's it. Now if you don't have a standard size patio door 5 or 6 foot or you've got a custom height the manufacturer will put their information inside on the on the frame of the window for you. And they'll give them their name. And there'll be a production code number. So what you can do is you can call up the manufacturer. And give them that production number. And that number will be specific to your door. And then you can order a screen directly from them. And they can ship it out usually in a couple of weeks.

So when we're doing a basement renovation we want to add a lot of heat to the floor. And the secret here is this when you have your rough in basement done by a builder they're going to drop in there's a a code requirement. So many square ft for every heat run. And they'll throw them into the ceiling. And they'll blow hot air into the ceiling. And it'll make it about halfway down. And then it'll start rising back up again. So what happens is when you're sitting there watching tv your heart is beneath that level of heat. So it's actually in about 10° which is what the temperature around the basement is in our area if you're only sitting in 10° you're going to get hypothermic it's why you need a blanket. So what we do is we want to tap into the side of our heat runs we want to bring a couple of extra lines down right near the floor. And we want to reduce the size of the ducting from a 5 to a 4 in. And that increases pressure blows the hot air across the floor. And now we're heating the room from the ground up. And not just from the ceiling. So you're going to need to add a couple of runs to the room you are heating space that was never heated before to that degree. So you're not going to disrupt the balance in the home you're just going to take,https://youtu.be/dsI_3lbwO7E?t=0,"['What is the purpose of adding extra heat lines to a basement renovation?', 'How does reducing ducting size from 5 to 4 inches affect the heating process?', 'Why is it necessary to add heated space that was never heated before during a basement renovation?', 'What happens when sitting in an area with lower temperature than the surrounding air due to heat distribution?', 'Can hypothermia be prevented by simply using a blanket in such situations?']"

And we're going to be bringing that heat level down closer to the floor. So the way we do this. And we're lucky because in residential ducting the metal's pretty thin all you do is you take your knife let me get up here. And show you. And you cut a hole the reason i'm showing you this technique is cuz a lot of people don't have the proper cutting tools for bringing in duct work. And i get that. So this works really great it's a nice little cheat. So what we have here is a 5-in side takeoff. And it has an adhesive gasket on it basically sticks right to the duck work. So we just want to make sure that we're cutting our big enough that we're opening up the backend space that's on here. And we're just going to eyeball that line. So there. And we'll keep cutting once you have your hole all you have to do is remove the the plastic gasket that exposes the adhesive all right. Now once you have that pressed onto the duck work over the hole you get a couple of these little number eight screws. And you just want to screw that together just for good measure you don't want to trust an adhesive long term. But it's handy for working on your own to have that on there because you don't need a second pair of hands holding that in place there we go let me,https://youtu.be/dsI_3lbwO7E?t=66,"['What type of metal is commonly used in residential ducting?', 'Why is cutting a hole in the ductwork necessary?', 'How do you ensure the adhesive gasket sticks properly to the ductwork?', 'What is the purpose of using number eight screws with the adhesive gasket?', 'Can you trust an adhesive gasket long-term for holding the ductwork in place?']"

And now we're good to go all right. So here we are we're going to just finish off one of our heat runs demonstrate the whole system  the idea being we wanted this to be blowing across the floor you can set the height where wherever you like it i've got this set. So that  after my flooring. And my baseboard are in i still have a few inches there of space i don't want my heat run sitting right on the baseboard  just in case that the measurements a little bit off like to have a little bit of mercy there. So i have a 4x10 boot the four 4in collar i've taken this piece of pipe. And linked it together i'm just going to stick it in here this is probably about the easiest production that you're going to get. So sooner or later while you're doing your duck work you're going to run into this issue the duck work when it comes pre-cut has one smooth edge. And one corrugated edge we'll call it. And sooner or later you're going to have to put it on something like this. And we're going to use this to go from 5 to 4 in to build pressure up. But you can see it doesn't fit. Now this is going to be one of these situations where you're going to want to go to the store you're going to want i have the right tool for the job don't be one of those guys that comes over with a par of snips. And cuts all of this into fins. And then kind of bends them together that's just ridiculous. And it's a good way to get hurt this tool here it's a crimper. And all you do it's slow. And monotonous is you go around the outside of the pipe crimping the pipe. And basically you're taking whatever that diameter is. And you're forcing it in. And out on the crimps to to create a new diameter of pipe. So that it fits inside the next [music] fitting there's no real skill involved in this just patience there we go. Now we take this perfect. So now that we have our extension up into the ceiling area all we have left. Now is put some 5-in pipe from this reducer over to my side takeoff in order to do that i need a piece of pipe here. And i need an angle. So a 90° angle. And then another length of pipe.

And i reach to the back. And i mark the middle. And the back of the duct that way when i'm cutting here. And remember this doesn't have to be perfect we're going to snap it together we're going to end up dimling both ends on this one just. So that that that's out of the way there we go. Now this stuff is sharp you could wear gloves if you're not comfortable working with sharp metal here we go. So now we just fold this together it's like tongue. And groove forse that in make like a heart shape. And then snap it together to make a round. Now it's locked in. And we're going to dimple our other end [music] max we should be playing some really good music right about. Now maybe you can add it in later maybe elevator music you know the kind in like one of those thriller movies where the guy's in the elevator. And he's on the way to go kill somebody. And all he hears all right here we go we'll get that piece in b boom. Now we have a 5-in elbow. And the way you make 90° is you have a wide end. And a short end on every one of these sections you just connect all the dots. So all the short pieces go together just like a little puzzle be really careful don't reach in. And turn it around there's a little metal joint on every one of these rings. And as your finger goes by it'll just rip it right open. So if you're going to grab just pinch the ends or hold the outside again wear gloves if you're not used to doing this this you're not comfortable bam 90°.

Now just to make sure this assembly doesn't come apart. Now i'm using a really good little self-tapping screw for duck work which is kind of handy cuz it digs in really good for the next piece of pipe we want to measure from here where the collar is to here where the collar is. And because it's already corrugated on both sides we don't have to use those fancy scissors again. So we stick out our measuring tape from where we want to go to where we want to go. And i'm getting a reading of about 15 in just for fun we're going to create this pipe first. And let's go all the way down i'm going to show you another tool you can add to your arsenal. And this looks like another pair of snips. But it's not it's really cool it has two blades in the middle. And it actually is used for cutting in a duct work that's pre-existing. So there's more than one application i'm just going to get down on the ground. And i'll show you how this works first we stab it. And then you start snipping.

Now this is actually kind of handy because there is no point that your hands get anywhere near the sharp metal. So let's say you wanted to put a trapo or or add something into existing duck work this is a great way to get in you can also use this when you're doing your side takeoff what we're going to do is we're going to get it on one side first. And you just bend the metal around to help it shape around the fins there we go our 5 in is just not small enough when you cut into the metal there's just all these shards. And everything else. So instead of trying to clean up the cut metal we're just going to rec crimp with these bad boys cuz they make the hole smaller than it does from the factory all right done get a couple screws in here.

So if you're like most people you're in a home that's got a bathroom that needs to be renovated. And you've got it all ripped apart. And then you run into this copper plumbing. Now you may not be the best plumber in the world. But if you can learn how to make one simple solder joint you can convert from copper to using pecs. And then you can just use a crimper to install all your plumbing through the rest of the shower this will enable any average homeowner to be able to add jets. And rain showers. And all kinds of fun features. And you can even run your plumbing around the nooks that you want to build on your walls. But you need a couple of simple tricks.

And here they are first you're going to need a copper cutting tube this is really simple little tool pick it up at the hardware store about 15 bucks. And copper is a really soft metal actually i'm going to go a little bit lower. So when i'm torching them well away from the wood copper is a really soft metal you can actually just tighten that tube on look at this. And it starts cutting right through. And every time you make a turn around the pipe you just turn it up a little bit more they come in different sizes. So if you're in an unrestricted area you can get one with a big handle it makes a little bit easier. But in this environment just a quarter turn. And then just keep on running it'll take about six or seven times around. And then you'll be able to cut right through the pipe. Now if you're good with the torch here we go we just broke through you could always just heat up this joint. And pop both of these at the same time a lot of people might find that a little tricky. So this just kind of eliminates all of those problems there we go. And tighten that on. And just work it around you'll notice also that this control area is really low back in the day this used to be standard to have it really low because the tub was used a lot more than the shower nowadays people are using the shower almost exclusively. And the times that this functions the tub is very rare. And so we're putting them up a lot higher. So it's a little more convenient for while you're having shower use there we go. So now we're we're completely clear all we have to do. Now is identify how they've got this mounted on looks like a couple of nails a couple of nails this is a fancy little stiletto tool it's like a little mini hammer. But it does. So many wonderful little things for those hard to reach places. Now in this situation we're not going to try to save any of this plumbing. So you can be as aggressive as you like because we have drained the water there we go. And then we'll just lift this up to loosen the nails. And pry that right off there we are. Now important don't throw this away you're most likely going to want to save this copper to add for your tub spout. And that is a good piece of copper. So no sense thrown in the garbage okay. So we got a hot air cold traditionally hot on the left if it's not you're going to be in for a surprise what i'm going to show you here is how to clean this how to torch it. And then how to convert to pex or just put a brass cap on. And the reason you're gonna learn both these options is if you have options it might save you a trick to run into the store. Now this is sand cloth. And it's funny because the last time we did a copper to pex video i used sand cloth i called it sandcloth says sandcloth on the box. And people were giving me different opinions about why i was calling it sand cloth in the video in the comments section below. And it's because that's what it's called on the box. So that's what i call it if you have a different training for it that's fine the goal here is to get it nice. And clean you can't torch on dirt you have to make sure that your coffer is copper in color before you try to torch anything. And you want to do about an inch. And a half don't try to just get cheap. And clean around the top because all it takes is one missed spot. And you're going to have a leak. So here we are here is the fitting that we're going to use to convert from copper to pex. Now this is plumbing language we talk male. And female things that get receiving. And things that go inside right it's the way it works. So this is the male version this is the female version the female version goes over top of the copper okay which is convenient the male version is the same size as the copper. And so this would be convenient if you're on a joint or using a coupling i just thought i'd throw that out there for you to see. But what we're using is the female version. And because the part of the plumbing we're doing right. Now is kind of mid demo we're just getting this all capped off. So we can pull the tub out i could also use just a regular plumbing cap. And i can cap my plumbing that way too okay. But since we're going to be converting to pecs for the long haul what i'm going to do to save myself time for tomorrow. So i'm just going to put six inches of pecs on there put on a test cap which is one of these little plastic caps here. And that'll be good for tonight. And then tomorrow we can just cut. And add the fittings when we're ready to run the plumbing. Now basically this comes already cleaned comes from the factory it's brass doesn't really tarnish. But what i like to do is scratch it up just a little bit. So that i have somewhere for the solder to sit into okay.

So when i'm doing my torching if you haven't done torching before what i'm looking to do is i'm going to use this solder there we go you heat up the joint where you want the solder to go to which is up here. And you add the solder from the bottom all right. So what you want to do is create a nice clean scratched up environment. So the solder has somewhere to sit. And you're basically sealing it for the whole width of the joint all right. So you end up sealing it about 50 times more than is necessary. And that is the goal to get such a good clean joint that there's no risk of it ever leaking. And then you can sleep at night. And you'll see when the fitting is hot enough the solder will melt on the opposite side of the pipe at the lowest part. And now you know when it's going in area pushed in. And it dripped out i know that whole thing is full of solder. Now i'm adding the heat to the top left i'm adding solder for the bottom right the heat goes up. So when it gets hot enough to melt solder on the bottom right i know it's been sucked because i added the flux. And there we go it's been sucked all the way to the top. And that's it that soldering job is done,https://youtu.be/jgkCmT8Cc98?t=350,"['What type of environment do you create for the solder to sit in during torching?', 'How much more than necessary does sealing a joint with solder achieve?', 'When is the fitting hot enough to melt solder on the opposite side of the pipe?', 'Why is adding heat to one area and then moving it to another effective in soldering?', 'What role does flux play in the soldering process?']"

And that's it that soldering job is done. So i just ran into the car i got my pex cutting tool. So i'm out of breath it's too cold to be staying around a t-shirt i wanted to show you this two different fittings you use to cap the end of the line these are called test caps they're made of plastic. And this is the brass cap that's if you're going to have a line. And it's going to end. And you want to crimp that. And not ever think about it again for the rest of your life not using that today we will be using these. And they're wonderful you just slide them on okay get a couple of rings slide those on. And crimp it. And that's it. So we're going to just stick this on the line. And then crimp it all up okay. Now we torched that only two minutes ago. But i'm not concerned about if it's too hot this pex handles a lot of heat the way you do this is you would put this test cap on. And it has a little stub on it. And you bring the ring right up to the the end here. And that tells you that you're in the right place line on your crimper. And done okay. So you want your ring about a quarter inch off the end of the pipe snug to the brass fitting boom. And this might seem a little bit tedious. And frustrating. But it is a lot quicker. And a lot more flexible than doing soldering,https://youtu.be/jgkCmT8Cc98?t=443,"['What type of material are test caps made of?', 'How do you attach a PEX line to a brass cap?', 'Can PEX lines handle extreme heat?', 'What is the purpose of using test caps in plumbing?', 'Why is it recommended to use test caps over soldering?']"

And a lot more flexible than doing soldering all right. So we are back here. Now to finish our conversion from copper effects. And install our shower valve this is the typical shower tub system it has hot. And cold shutoffs as well as it has integrated pex adapters. So that you can run pecs directly to this. And the tub line comes with a three quarter inch pex adapter which solves all of the problems we've been experienced in this industry going to pecks. And having dripping from the shower head when you do pecs to your tub. So what we need to do here is really simple it's just a matter of doing any of our our copper work first we can let everything cool down. And then we can just crimp everything together. So these systems come the tap just threads off like this just be careful this is all machined brass. And it is sharp you may want to wear gloves for this case this is just the test cap with the ring on it. And there we go that's our valve. So i'm going to suggest since i'm going to go with the copper option for the bottom i'm going to suggest that you take out the stops for the hot. And the cold just pinch them together. And slide that out okay. And just give her a there we go it's all in one piece. Now the instructions that come with this do not tell you that it's required however experience says when you're using a soldering wet tool if you have anything on that fixture that's made of rubber you're probably best to get rid of it there we go. And that is why we put the drain cover on [laughter] there we are. So now there's nothing left here. But solid brass. Now as far as the height that you install your valve at it's completely optional. And consulting with this particular client she has grandchildren that she uses to bathe in this tub. So she needs to be able to access the water while she's bent over at the tub. So it's not as low as traditional for a tub. But it's high enough that you can reach it without having to bend over while you're having a shower. So it's kind of the best of both worlds here. So before we get started don't forget rule number one turn off the water drain the line just because you turn it off doesn't mean you're not gonna have a mess the lines are pressurized. So always drain the line first. So this valve is going to go on our center line which is about here if you're in a situation where you have more stud space pex is awesome they have these wonderful little holders. And you can actually bend it around to go to a 90 without using a crimp okay in our situation here though where we don't have enough room to turn that. So i'm going to have to use an elbow. And since i'm using an elbow on the hotline there's no sense using this on the cold because i'm only going to be able to have as much pressure as on the hot side anyway in a shower. So the easiest way to hook up your plumbing is to use a laser level get your laser level on the center line. And then just mark all your lumber where the line is okay all the way up to the shower head. And that's it. Now there's no more measuring involved done got to own a laser level if you run away at home next thing is to rough in just to measure all your components we're going to temporarily screw this to the wall good to know in this system the there's two holes for screwing it. And two holes for attaching the plate the ones that you screw to the wall with this manufacturer don't have any threading in them. So they're easy to identify i know some companies thread all the holes regardless it always drives you crazy. So we will put that there and,https://youtu.be/jgkCmT8Cc98?t=529,"['What is the typical shower tub system installed in a house?', 'Why is it recommended to remove rubber fixtures when soldering wet tools are used?', 'How does one determine the height of installing a valve for a shower tub system?', 'What is the purpose of using an elbow instead of a 90-degree bend in plumbing?', 'How can you measure and mark lumber accurately without measuring all components?']"

Now what you measure is you measure the gap. And then add one inch. So you get a half inch for each fitting. So we're going to go seven. So i need to cut an eight inch piece of pipe. And measure my eight inch with my thumb of course this is a rough to mit if you're at all concerned you can just take off a little bit for good luck that's fine here okay leave that there for. Now and you also want to cut at the same time about a five inch extension for the tub spout. Now the particular tub spoke fixture that we have is a slip-on tub spout where the attachment happens near the wall you really only need about two inches out of the wall i just like to go a little overboard. So that i'm guaranteed i'm not going to have any soldering on the pipe where i'm trying to slide it over the top fixture later okay because we're dealing with copper. And we're dealing with our hands we're going to have oil on the line we just make sure we clean up the copper all the ends give them a good scratch with the sand cloth of course use the fitting brush inside all of the fittings give them all a good scratch including here. And you want to scratch up the valve as well before we continue we just want to get all of our torch products sitting here handy ready to roll one of the best ways to do your soldering is to have your fixture mounted somewhere. So that you don't have to be holding on to something that's going to get right on i like to wear my safety glasses when i'm torching because when i get my fixture soldered i like to use the brush with the flex. And just give it a quick wipe okay guarantees a good seal. And you may get something flashing in your face. So that takes care of that. Now before we solder we want to assemble all right. So we want to get flux inside all of our fixtures all right. So i put this together temporarily for. Now i've got a screw in this elbow. So that while i'm heating things up in the side. And the sorry the  the flux goes kind of very liquid a lot of times these fittings will fall off. And i don't want all the stuff falling in behind the tub. So this will just anchor it all. And keep it all in place until i'm done i've thrown a screw here to get my water line bent out of the way to keep it away from the heat. So now we're ready to do this [applause] i know it looks a little archaic. But the fact is we're not welding we're soldering. So you know in a perfect world it's nice to have a nice little pretty joint. But my goal is to get the solder not at the joint is to get it inside of the fitting where we scratched it up. Now i've got a scratch fitting. And a scratch pipe. And solder stuck in all those little grooves that's what the flux does it's like a magnet. And it pulls all the solder into the inside of the joint where the heat is. So you heat where you want the solder to go. And then when it's hot enough to melt it it sucks it in. So although maybe a couple of points here you might see what you think is a pinhole i'll guarantee you that is water tight. And before we close up the wall we will guarantee that it's watertight. And do a pressure test. So we're going to be okay,https://youtu.be/jgkCmT8Cc98?t=765,"['What type of coupling is recommended for attaching the tub?', 'How much should you add to the measured gap when using a half inch coupling?', 'Why is it necessary to cut an extra 1/2 inch on each fitting?', 'What is the purpose of scratching the valve before soldering?', 'What happens when flux is applied to the fittings and pipe?']"

And do a pressure test. So we're going to be okay real quick no don't worry if you get any of this  solder on your acrylic they do not bond together. And it will just wipe right off okay. Now because we have turned off the water right yeah i'm pretty sure. And drain the lines well i'm pretty sure i'm confident because i'm looking over at the bathroom tap. And it's open. And nothing's coming out yeah all right yay all right. So what we're going to do is we're just going to measure how where we want to be here with the water line with our thumb just a little bit below this again is eyeballing. And it might be easier if the blade is facing you sit in the cradle. And this is you want to cut while you turn that's how you cut it straight without collapsing the pipe if you just cut it straight on you're going to crush the pipe out of shape like that. And then putting on the fittings is real pain in the butt. So always add a ring as you go okay. And it's not going to stay where you want it to. But that's okay we also need to add enough to go from here to here i love the fact that this pex is covered in numbers because it makes it really easy to measure okay again we can put the rings on from ahead of time because we're going to have two joints all right. Now here's one of these situations everything is. So tight together that we can't connect it [music]. Now we can take that off. And put it all in place. And then we'll throw another set screw on again just keep it all still while we're working all right same with the other side twist. And cut the end is no good to us ring fitting two rings connect that eyeball it it all right there we go. Then we have to take our trusty crimpers. Now these are awesome i think the last time we did one of these copper to pex videos we used a different locking system since. Then crimp fry has come out with a crimping tool that is around dollars instead of four hundred. So it's finally making something that a homeowner can use. So you can use these solid rings to crimp. Now as a homeowner without a huge investment in your plumbing again this means that you can do your own plumbing. And the tools will be a lot cheaper than hiring a plumber. Now the goal here is to get the ring about a quarter inch away from the fitting all these fittings have these little barbed rings on it. So as long as you're making solid contact on one of these rings you're going to be fine. But if you aim for the quarter inch rule you're sure to be good as gold [music] you know the scary thing is plumbers today are using exactly the same system that seems like an awful lot of money to play with lego to pay for a plumber. Now don't get me wrong i love my plumber. And there's a time. And a place to call in a professional. But when they make plumbing systems this simple man man oh man you better learn how to do this yourself or you're just throwing away your money,https://youtu.be/jgkCmT8Cc98?t=1064,"['What is the purpose of adding rings while installing PEX tubing?', 'How does one ensure a secure connection between copper and PEX fittings?', 'What is the recommended distance between the ring and the fitting?', 'Can homeowners install plumbing systems without professional assistance?', 'Why is it important to learn how to do plumbing work oneself?']"

And then close them into the end of the cradle you probably see it easier on this side i just got to push it in right drop this in there okay we are good to go the last thing to do here of course is we have to put in the shower system just thread this on again go backwards until you feel it sit right nice. And gentle in case you're cross threaded there we go i know i mentioned this when i was taking this apart when i'm putting it back on you've got to use a pair of gloves here you're supposed to do this hand tight you can use a wrench just for a quarter turn.

So my son's downstairs turning on the water supply what we do is we get on the phone together. So that i can communicate with him if we have any leaks. And the first thing we're going to do is with the the taps closed we're going to check our solder joint here. And our connections leading up to the valve. And we have no initial issues can you go full pressure please all right. And we're all pressurized okay come on upstairs buddy okay. So now here's a great little invention that i get at my plumbing supply store  i haven't seen this in the hardware store before. So if you're looking for one you might want to go to a specialty supplier. But this is just a simple little cap has a gasket on it an extended pipe. So that it's easy to cut wall board. And identify things when you're doing your tile work. But it just threads into your shower head spout okay it's exactly the same diameter as the fixture itself. And you just tighten that on nice. And tight. Now you can test the pressure in the whole line because i'm capped up here with this. And i'm capped down here with the solder. So now we're going to open up the cold water supply perfect we're all finished our plumbing rough-in system. Now the final trim goes on after the tile. And that's also where the cartridge gets installed in here the reason they have the shut-off valves on this bracket is. So that you're not mixing hot water through the cold water line i know that there are some systems out there that come with a test cap that don't have the locks. And i've had situations like that where you install your shower before you know it a couple days later the toilet's running hot water while you're busy tiling. And such. So these are designed to keep the water from flowing until you get the rest of the system put together. And that's about all you need to know.

And this is what i was mentioning. It's like a chinese finger puzzle. So the more pressure is on, you know, instilled on this connection, the stronger it holds. Now, we can generally just stick it right on the copper. And shove it down. And create the connection. But before you do, you want to take some sand cloth. And clean your fitting just to make sure that you don't have any [music] burrs because or or any solder bumps like this. If you don't have a nice smooth connection, it will leak.

And we put it on the threads. So, in order to prep for our our valve, we need teflon tape. We're going to do a few runs on the threads. So, basically, when it comes to plumbing, there's outside diameter. And inside diameter of the pipes. What we're dealing with is all 1/2 in outside diameter. And the reason that's important is because when you go shopping, they'll be different sizes. 1/2 in, 3/4. And so, when you're dealing with most water supply, the copper pipes in the house are/ in. If it's all modern, it's still 1/2 in,. But it'll be in plastic piping. If you go to 3/4 supply, traditionally that is a much larger volume of water. Sometimes people use that on their hot water going to their their tub if they have a large volume they want to fill,. But traditionally 1/2 in is all you get. So, we're going to put this on here. We'll just hand tighten these. And then we'll get the wrench out. And then we'll finish that off. Now, traditionally, it's not really necessary to use teflon. And plumbers's paste. A lot of guys will just use, you know, just the teflon or just the paste. But since it doesn't [music] hurt, i use both. Unfortunately, there's a lot of products manufactured overseas nowadays. And you find in my experience doing warranty work that a lot of times there's not really a problem with anything except for the fact that it's just not manufactured up to snuff. And nowadays manufacturers don't seem to worry about quality control coming off the assembly line. They just replace something when it doesn't work. So, with that in mind, a little overkill on making sure your compression fittings are nice. And secure is probably a good idea because the net effect of something not working is a flood destroying your ceiling, possibly your flooring,. And all they're going to do is giving you a brand new free 79 cent fixture. Who cares about their 79 cents? Traditionally, on the back, it'll have markings. It'll have cold, hot, up,. And down,. And that tells you which way to install it. Pretty simple. So, we mark the center line on the wall. You place your fixture against your 2x4. And use a couple of short screws. Mount [music] it. Now, this product here is the sherlock rings. Blah blah blah blah blah. They're 1/2 in rings, which is/2 in diameter the outside of the pipe, which is the same as the copper as the plastic. These rings as we take that, we just slide it over the pipe. And we place them on our [music] fixture. And we put this ring within a quarter inch of the end. That way, we're clamping down on one of the rings on the brass. Okay? We want to have pressure in between these rings. And that's where you get your fit. So, we just simply push this on, crimp them together. This takes a little bit of force. Make sure you close the tool entirely. And. Then from there, all we do is we cut back our water supply where we want [music] it. Put on the other rings. Slide them over the top. Take our [music] elbow. As you can see, the advantages to all of this are really quite obvious. It's rather quick. And when i'm done crimping this together, we're finished with the water supply. We can test it right away. So, the tools that we're using here don't require a whole lot of skill, just a couple of simple crimps. The average homeowner can do this without any difficulty, a cutting tool for the pipe, a decent ability to measure,. And you've got modern plumbing. The downside is is you have to rely on your ability to crimp this to the exact depth that it holds the water pressure back. And not too close. And not too far away that you get a proper seal. And by the looks of it, there is room for manufacturer defect that if the crimp ring doesn't grab properly, it could break loose. So, we'll have to wait until we do a water test to find out if it all holds together. 14 78. Mark my center.

The only downside is the cost. , if you're going to use this on a regular basis, you might want to learn how to do traditional plumbing with a torch. But, if you're doing a home renovation or a simple upgrade, the $10 of fitting is worth the money because $10 $20. And i can switch over to plastic plumbing. And i don't need to hire a plumber. I did it in about 20 minutes. Fantastic.

And shower renovation. And save a ton of [music] money. So the first step of any renovation of course is demolition. And that's a fancy word for take out the old stuff. So what we've got going on here today is let's just talk real quick about some safety equipment  i got these awesome gloves of the color of my football team it works  you're also if you're a homeowner you're want to want to get maybe some eye protection working with this tile when you're working with it you know you get a shard or you're going to get cut edges you want to make sure you're being smart about it another good thing would be to get a mask a lot of the reasons we're ripping these bathrooms out is because we got mold in behind the walls this is an n95 mask it's for particulates this is especially good for dust. And mold spores. And that sort of thing. So you buy three of these for 10 bucks. And they'll last for the entire length of the renovation make sure you make that investment. And if you don't own a fancy pair of gloves i grabed these from the store today these are five bucks this is a leather palm leather backing on it great investment if you're diy one siiz fits all. So would suggest those as well. Now before we get into this let's talk about the process demolition of course is just the removal of what was installed in the reverse order. And if you follow that advice everything will go well. But before we get started rule number one turn off the water i know that you have control you can turn off the valve. And all these wonderful things. But you never really know what's behind a wall. So to protect your home. And your investment just turn off the water. And open the taps at the top of the house. And open the taps at the bottom of the house drain out all the lines. And get rid of the pressure there we go we just hear the air rushing. So we're cleaning out the lines. Now we know when we renovate we're,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=0,"['What is the first step in any renovation?', 'Why is it important to turn off the water before demolition?', 'What type of safety equipment is recommended for working with tile?', 'How can you protect yourself from mold spores during a renovation?', 'What should be done to drain out the lines before starting a renovation?']"

So we're cleaning out the lines. Now we know when we renovate we're not going to be able to cut a line. And have a pipe burst on us. So for ripping out the bathroom you need a few basic tools here one is a tub remover tool you can find this at your hardware store plumbing department about 10 bucks  screwdriver to turn it couple of different bits usually the phillips head. And the flath head is about all you're going to run into got your drill. And you're going to need your allen keys. Now most of these tubs here they have a set screw in the bottom you can't see it it's in an awkward spot. But you need to know it's there. So you don't drive yourself crazy trying to unthread this or rip it off the wall until that set screw is released you can't remove this. So why don't we just start there  this is a delta system it's an imperial system of course. So this is a 532 bit. And you got to go underneath here. So we go to this side. And usually one twist is enough to release this darn thing yep all right. So now you can see it on camera it makes sense right that sits right in there. Now you can stick this in a whole lot of different places. And be very unsuccessful. So be patient with it turn it a little bit until you feel it sit in the seat. And then you can give it a turn all right of course we have the shower valve usually these handles have a decorative c on it. And you can just use a screwdriver to pop that off. But it has a set screw as well. Now that that's out of the away there's usually a couple of screws on the plate these older model systems always have surface screws the newer ones there's a wall plate that gets mounted. And it snaps in. But that makes that simple. So now your wall can be removed without interrupting your plumbing okay secondly we want to remove the overflow in the waist. Now usually just one or two screws here the idea here is the plumbing behind the tub is going to stay in place when you remove the tub. So you have to disengage the trims here. So that that can happen. So here's my fancy tub remover tool. And it has got two different functions on this depending on the size of the tub this the short end goes right in there nice. And snug over the crossbars. And the way i do this is i lay a screwdriver across the top push down. And turn counterclockwise. Now in the older tubs because it's steel you usually just use plumers putty to put these on this tub strainer basket is. So recessed my tub remover tool is of use zero useless not going to help all right i got to have to show you another trick. So that is amazing that's the first time ever my tub remover tool didn't work for me not sure what's going on with this. But you know not everything is created equal right. So we got a couple of tips that might work for you you can use two really thick screwdrivers or you can use what i got here a couple of old allen keys great big ones here we go. And i'm going to show you two tricks here one of them is you just put in the allen keys okay. And then you create this cross again. And you can force like that. And you can unthread it that way. Now this only works if the crossbars in the bottom of the the tub drain here are intact okay. And you can see that works quite well. And you can put as much force as you need to on that. And unthread it if you have a tub strainer here that the crosses have eroded away or rusted away here's another thing you can do realize that this is a chrome plated material it's usually a soft metal like a brass you can take an old chisel put on the edge of that. And kind of go square on just to create a dent. And then you can lay it a little flatter. And you can just tap it around that takes a lot of time makes a lot of noise. But it is effective all right i  i'm not sure how to remove a tub if you don't get this out cuz. Now you're connected to the house's plumbing if you have to remove this. And you can't remove this in strainer you're going to use it cutting tool or a torch. And cut the tub in half i don't know unbelievable. So it's good to have a couple of tricks up your sleeve. And voila renovator one bathroom nothing all right. So all shower heads are created equal they usually have a little shower arm. And there's a compression fitting on this as well. So if you just give it a little of a turn. And a pull you can get this out of the way all right. Now there's got a couple of options here you can just grab right in here with your pliers. And just turn it. And you're probably going to just take the shower head off okay. And then you can try giving this a turn it can be a little bit frustrating cuz the guy that put this in originally usually used a lot of force okay. So get a good grip on it. And then once you get that started you can just kind of finish it off by hand of course if you're stuck. And the wrench isn't working for you you can combine this with another trick that i know you get the wrench on there nice. And tight throw a screwdriver in the pipe gives you extra leverage. And you can pull both of those at the same time there's no way that that went on strong enough that that won't work. So once,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=121,"['What are some basic tools needed to rip out a bathroom?', 'How do you remove a tub from the wall?', 'What is the purpose of a set screw in a tub?', 'Can you use any type of tool to remove a shower head?', 'Why is it difficult to remove a shower head sometimes?']"

So once we've got our fixtures removed the next thing is to get rid of all the silicone joints that are around here because we're going to be removing the walls next. And that is a lot easier to do if they are not silicone to the tub just grab your knife. And [applause] cut the ceiling doesn't appear to be yeah it is silicone. And painted. So we want to cut that loose as well all right. So now it's time to remove the walls. And if you've grabbed your sledgehammer or one of these beautiful stanley bars you've got the wrong tool in your hand like i said before this is more surgery. So we have to be smart because what we want to do is want to reinstall the new tubs around in the same space without creating a mountain of work repairing walls. So the technique that you want to use here is really simple grab an old flat chisel. And a hammer. And you want to remove this tile one at a time. So we have control over the wall. And hopefully we don't damage the wall board. So badly you can see tile chips. So make sure you wear your [applause] glasses working like this allows us to cut this wallboard right beside the old painted line. And then we can create a tile line from the same spot on the wall. So we don't have to repair all the drywall. And repaint. Now if you've never done this kind of work before you need to understand that when ceramic tile breaks like that it's not the clay that's dangerous it's the glaze this glaze is razor sharp make sure you're wearing your gloves. Now i can create a cut line. And i can cut right down the drywall. Then we're ready to remove the walls okay. So here's the deal if you're a home renovator. And you're working on your own house. And you don't want to be dressed up like a clown with a diaper on your face you know you realize you're taking some risk okay. So for me i'm not a big fan of wearing the mask let's get rid of that. And i'll tell you why i find wearing the mask makes it really hard to breathe. And to be honest with you i guess some a little old school i kind of believe like whatever you do for living is going to kill you. So you know you can try to take all the safety precautions you like to avoid injury that's one thing. But i'm not going to worry about a little bit of dust. Now and again  if i'm working on real dusty environment i set up negative air i. Now wear a mask on occasion  i'm going to cut  8 ft of drywall. Now with a reciprocator it's going to make a little dirt. And if you're afraid of dirt. Then don't renovate oh you'll see here i'm just going to cut about 1 inch back from my finish line this is outside of the tub it's not necessary to have any kind of waterproof board here. So that's why i'm cutting at this point [applause] okay the other way to do this is with a knife if you don't have one of those fancy tools you can always use a knife. Now looks like the last renovator that was here used a green board it's jointed right at the same spot as what we're doing. And then they taped it did a bunch of mud work. So i got a half inch of mud to carve through first. But if you're patient run this down a few times it'll eventually work right through the back of the drywall okay here we goo i'm going to show you my technique for removing the tub surround walls no you don't chisel off every tile i actually had someone comment in the section below about could i just remove all the tile with a chisel. And then tile again on the same small board. And the answer is no for obvious reasons like this the surface protection that paper that's been treated for the antimold. And the water resistance it's going to get damaged okay it's not worth your effort to try to save anything here because i'll show you how you'll see in a second you saw how hard it was to chip away this i can remove the rest of these walls in less than 10 minutes okay. So bear with me. And watch the technique. And it's real simple what we're looking at is just smashing holes right through everything in the same [applause] swing okay. So here that's that's a stud that's a stud i've cut the wallboard away because i'm wearing my safety glasses. And my gloves i can get in there. And reach. And grab it. Now just use your your force. And now use your hammer just shake it it'll jiggle all of the drywall screws that are in this board loose from the backs side all right generally comes out in one piece things like this tear off okay. Now you can just walk that right out to your garbage bin. So a lot of homeowners i know have the same kind of problem what to do with the garbage they don't want to pile it up in their garage they can't put it on the curb for the city to pick up. So here we go we're going to show you a little secret i got to do this quick before my bag blows away all right if you've never seen this before this is dumpster in a bag you can buy this at the local building stores a brilliant little invention comes with these two straps all you got to do is lay it out near your curb. And when you're done you call the 1 1800 number that's on the side of the bag pay with your visa over the phone these guys will come by grab an arm scoop it up take it away for you the whole thing full i can put an entire bathroom in there tub toilet walls floors the whole thing including the vanity on the top it's about $250 for removal brilliant deal if you want to get a rollof bin you risk damage in your driveway takes a lot more space. And usually start at five or 600 bucks. So this is perfect project size. So a quick trick here before you start pulling up all the walls to help reduce your scope of work when you're done remember the  the ceiling here there's going to be a drywall joint the tape will go from here up. And then across. And if you're not careful to cut through the paper before you rip off this wall you'll peel it off the ceiling. Then you're going to have to repair the drywall. And repaint the ceiling again. So we try our best to avoid that from happening we'll run our knife across here a few times almost like we're trying to cut it right through the drywall because lots of people use a lot of mud in the corners you want to make sure you got that paper gut all right. Now it's right back to the same technique only different. And just give it little tugs little vibrations till all these screws are po loose all right. And then once we've got it kind of separated we'll downward force. So that we don't damage our ceiling there we go. So here's the edge of our ceiling. Now that is perfect there's absolutely zero damage here it's exactly what we're looking for  when we go back with our new wallboard. And tile our new tile is going to be thicker than this old stuff this is what we like to call biscuit it's really thin the newer one's thicker. So it'll actually have a thicker profile. And that is going to put us in a position where we're going to finish clean on that ceiling no rework on the ceiling there's another whole day you're not going to waste i get a lot of people asking me questions about this sort of situation here this black. And the insulation. And they ask these questions in the comment section below. And what you want to know is this is not mold right this is air movement. And when air is moving through a building cavity it's going to pick up whatever dirt is around. And it's going to deposit it wherever there's resistance. So this is just air movement probably because it just wasn't sealed up tight enough on the back side of this as well it's nothing to be concerned about it doesn't affect the insulation quality it just looks ugly. So if it bothers you you can replace it. But you don't need to okay. So this is an empty cavity we got plumbing. And wiring back here that's a really deep wall it's a mechanical wall probably going to have heat runs as well. So here you want to be careful watch your swing you don't want to go all too hard. And punch right through here because you might hit something important. And wreck it remember keep your mouth closed when you're doing this sort of thing here we go same technique all right make sure the silicone is cut bit of a vibration one thing you're going to want to do here check for nails on the adjacent wall okay make sure there's room for that wallboard to open [music] up. And when you get it going it'll just open like a door. And again since you're walking through your house fill off all the broken bits that are going to make a mess along the way might as well leave all the mess in the same room. So then you don't have to clean the entire home later there we go. Now this piece of board is probably about 60 or 70 lbs. So keep that in mind  if you're working alone or 70 lbs is too much to carry you can just smash across. And then smash down first. And you can reduce the size of the w right. So for the top side of this wall i really like to smash it down into two pieces tearing out this whole wall. And protecting the ceiling while carrying all that weight. And not slicing your leg on this cut tile it can be a trick. So what i would do let's just find a place where we know the cavity is safe we'll smash right up that gr line to the ceiling. Now i'm going to put my hammer up against the frame on an angle here. So that i can fry it off again same thing right you want to pull it down from the ceiling away from your cut line well i mean it's obvious that there's a lot more to do in a demolition than just just taking out a sledgehammer. And beating the hell out of it i don't know they love to show that on tv. But let's stop. And think here for a second what if we beat the tar out of the wall. And we hit the stack right you punch a hole in this bad boy. Now you're bringing in the plumber. And you're replacing the stack right into the attic that's attic work as well what if you swung the hammer here. And you punctured the joint in this copper line if you didn't notice that you did that you'd put your bathroom back together again turn the water back on you'd flood out the entire house. So when you're tearing things apart if you don't know what's on the other side or inside that wall which you don't you have to use some patience. And a little bit of skill i know it's great tv. But using a sledgehammer inside a bathroom is really not what that tool was made for. Now we don't want to wreck the ceiling. So we got to pull down there we go [applause] we're bat in a thousand. So far we've saved the ceiling remember when you're doing a demolition. And you're doing an isolated project like we're only doing the tub. And the tub suround it's our job to. Now stop. And think how do i keep the scope of work from getting out of control okay. So one of the things i don't want to do is i don't want to have to start getting into finished carpentry because that's a brand new set of tools that's a brand new day of work oh my goodness. So what we have is a outside corner bead holding this wall in place. So i'm going to grab my hacksaw. And i'm going to cut my corner bead okay going to set it. And go a 45° angle. And you'll cut both sides there we go. Now want to rip apart my corner bead on my wall i'm going to leave all the trim alone there's another whole set of tools. And a whole setup i mean can you imagine having to set up all your tools to make two cuts what a pain in the butt okay. So now this bathroom here is basically a great big square. And they've put the tub in here. And added this wall to bring the controls into this style of construction means that you are going to be doing some mud work. And you're going to have to do some paint. But it's only on a tiny little wall okay. So when you're taking this apart don't even try to save the corner don't try to peel it open to put it back later you're going to crack the paint line you're going to make a mess just get it out of the way move on it's going to be in the way of installing your wall as well. And you can see here they've done it with nails okay. So the best way to get rid of this is actually swing the claw hammer at it right on the corner once you've popped it off the wall you can just give it a y all right. Now and you can be as surgical as you want to find each nail pull them out all right make sure it's not going to do anything fancy done same thing just take your time it's easier when you're going down cuz it'll bend. And break at everywhere the nail is you just put your clown behind it. And you pull it out. And then you can pull it down again. And if it doesn't break away nice. And clean for you just throw your claw into the wallboard. So you get the grip. And then you can rip it out. And that's where we cut it perfect one more time okay remember to always close the blade before you put it in your pocket yeah i learned that one the hard way. So the majority of our demo is complete. And so before we pull out the tub we're going to just take a minute take all the nails. And screws out of the wall clean up any extra debris that needs to be removed. And then we're going to take everything off the floor sweep clean out the tub vacuum we're going to start with a clean slate again before i start messing with the tub cuz the secret here is that the floor in this bathroom we want to keep okay. So we're actually reinstalling it with the same floor still attached. So we want to take a little extra care here. And make sure that as we go we're not causing any damage that's not necessary again keep your scope of work reduced. And then this kind of project is very predictable. So the next step in our demolition is we,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=475,"['What type of tools do you recommend for removing silicone joints from a tub?', 'Why is it important to wear safety glasses and gloves when working with ceramic tile?', 'How can you avoid damaging the ceiling during wall removal?', 'What is the best technique for removing drywall without creating a mess?', 'How can you safely remove the tub surround walls without causing damage to the surrounding area?']"

So the next step in our demolition is we have to remove the tub. But before we can move the tub we have to cut our plumbing out. And here's why we're in an al cove situation. And this tub won't pull straight out into the room because the frame is exactly the same size as the tub. But on that side of the wall there's drywall. So i have half an inch too small to be able to slide the tub out. So what i have to do is i have to lift it roll it. And then slide it in between the the studs of the wall in order to take it out. And the reason i want to do it that way is because. Then i'm not affecting. And increasing the scope of work by causing new drywall work. And new painting going on it takes a few extra minutes. But if you take the time to cut the the plumbing out of the way. Then you. And pull all the nails you have all the room that you're going to need to be able to roll the tub out. And we'll show you how to do that in just a minute. But first remember we have our water supply off you just need one of these little copper cutting tubes. And i'm going to pick a spot that's convenient for me for putting the plumbing back together i don't want to have it anywhere near my wood bracing okay. So now we've cut. And capped all of our plumbing it's completely out of the way. Now so we can remove our tub. And you can see the entire process for how to do all this plumbing on our next copper depex video. So the last step that we have before we pull our tub out is we just go around. And make sure that we pull out all of these nails. And screws again the gap here is exactly 60 in the tub is exactly 60 in. So there's no room to maneuver here if we're constantly bumping in nails. And screws. So don't drive yourself crazy just take 2 minutes. So just keep in mind when you're cleaning your wall before you pull the tub out when you pull the tub out you're going to want to be comfortable. So you're going to roll it. And you're going to lift it up to where you're standing comfortable. So you're going to hold the tub here you got another 32 inches. So you want to make sure you're you're pulling all the nails up to four four. And a half feet just. So that you're not getting anything snagged especially your hands all right. So so far we've managed to remove all of the shower fixtures all of the walls all of the tile. And we haven't damaged anything outside of our scope of work which is new tub. And new tile suround. So the last thing we got to do before we pull the tub make sure we cut out the silicone joint down here. And i mean sacrifice your blade get that right in there you're going to dull off the tip. And that's okay that's why they make them break offs okay. Now we've got this moving mat here. So that we have somewhere to set this tub after we pull it out remember we're trying to remove the reinstall the tub in the same exact spot without damaging this tile if we pull this off we manage to keep this cost of this job down to $3,000 instead of upwards of six or seven that would be awesome okay. So i'm going to attempt to do this on my own for all of the benefit of everyone out there who's doesn't have anybody around who can help them out  i actually am pretty lucky here because i don't have a lot of studs. And my walls on the end i've got this stud here. And i've got this big cavity here that i can work with i've only got one on the other side. And all my plumbing's out of the way. So i should be okay to find some room to wiggle this out what i want to do is i want to just first of all start by rolling it forward. And then kicking it in. So that i break the seal. And get this tub away from the tile. And i think i've done that okay. And already i'm getting caught on the drywall over here. And the secret to how this works is you got to give it just a bit of a twist. And then get this edge of the tub in between the studs the insulation cavity. So you can slide it over a little bit you don't need a whole lot of extra room to wiggle one of these out just a little bit there we go. Now at this point because this is a steel tub  i would recommend grabbing a neighbor get some extra help carrying this down the stairs i know there's a lot of people out there we could probably lift this up. And walk out no problem. But remember the goal here is to reduce the scope of work putting a hole in a wall on the way down the staircase is not going to help you out with that throw it in just a note if you do your demolition the day before garbage day. And you want to recycle your tub the easiest way to do it is leave it on your curb on for garbage day morning there's always somebody driving around the neighborhood with a truck picking up metal things to take a recycling we got a typical situation we got a lot of debris here. But i just wanted to point out once again here's the stack our plumbing line comes out on a 45 comes across pick up this vent. And then there's a p trap to here. And then we have this plumbing. And this looks like it could be reused. But here's the issue our new tub has got a different body mold to it. So our center line is going to be in a different location all right we don't have a 4-in ledge on the front with a little edge on the back. So we're actually going to be moving over here a little bit. And the back side has got to go up to 20 in not 16. So although this looks like this might be able to be saved. And reused the fact is it'll be a lot easier for us to just start from scratch. And put everything exactly where we want it. So we're going to leave this in place for. Now because there is a pe trap full of water. But tomorrow when we start to redo the plumbing we'll cut open the floor a little bit. And cut this pipe off. And we're going to establish a brand new plumbing system here for the drain i know it's a bit of a fight you know youd like to be able to save something if you can. But in the long run you're going to cause yourself a lot of problem. And this kind of stuff should not be attached to your tub under pressure don't try to ever force it in there that's a sure way to make it leak. So if you're like most people you're in a home that's got a bathroom that needs to be renovated. And you've got it all ripped apart. And then you run into this copper plumbing. Now you may not be the best plumber in the world. But if you can learn how to make one simple solder joint you can convert from copper to using pecs. And then you can just use a crimp to install all your plumbing through the rest of the shower this will enable any average homeowner to be able to add jets. And rain showers. And all kinds of fun features. And you can even run your plumbing around the nooks that you want to build on your walls. But you need a couple of simple tricks. And here they are first you're going to need a copper cutting tube this is really simple little tool pick it up at the hardware store about 15 bucks. And copper is a really soft metal actually i'm going to go a little bit lower. So when i'm torching them well away from the wood copper is a really soft metal you can actually just tighten that tube on look at this. And it starts cutting right through. And every time you make a turn around the pipe you just turn it up a little bit more they come in different sizes. So if you're in an unrestricted area you can get one with a big handle it makes a little bit easier. But in this environment just a quarter turn. And then just keep on running it'll take about six or seven times around. And then you'll be able to cut right through the pipe. Now if you're good with a torch there we go we just broke through you could always just heat up this joint. And pop both of these at the same time a lot of people might find that a little tricky. So this just kind of eliminates all of those problems there we go tighten that on. And just work it around you'll notice also that this control area is really low back in the day this used to be standard to have it really low because the tub was used a lot more than the shower nowadays people are using the shower almost exclusively. And the times that this functions the tub is very rare. And so we're putting them up a lot higher. So it's a little more convenient for while you're having shower use there we go. So now we're we're completely clear all we have to do. Now is identify how they've got this mounted on looks like a couple of nails couple of nails this is a fancy little stiletto tool it's like a little mini hammer. But it it does. So many wonderful little things for those hard to reach places. Now in this situation we're not going to try to save any of this plumbing. So you can be as aggressive as you like because we have drained the water there we go. And then we'll just lift this up to loosen the nails. And pry that right off there we are. Now important don't throw this away you're most likely going to want to save this copper to add for your tub spo. And that is a good piece of copper. So no sense throwing in the garbage okay. So we got our hot. And our cold traditionally hot's on the left if it's not you're going to be in for a surprise  what i'm going to show you here is how to clean this how to torch it. And then how to convert to peex or just put a a brass cap on. And the reason you're going to learn both of these options is if you have options it might save you a trick to run into the store. Now this is sand cloth. And it's funny because the last time we did a coer toex video i used sand cloth i called it sand cloth says sand cloth on the box. And people were giving me different  opinions about why i was calling it sand cloth in the video in the comments section below. And it's cuz that's what it's called on the box. So that's what i call it if you have a different trading for it that's fine the goal here is to get it nice. And clean you can't torch on dirt you have to make sure that your copper is copper in color before you try to torch anything. And you want to do about an inch. And a half don't try to just get cheap. And clean around the top cuz all it takes is one miss spot. And you're going to have a leak. So here we are here is the fitting that we're going to use to convert from copper to peex. Now this is plumbing language we talk male. And female  things that get receiving. And things that go inside right it's the way it works. So so this is the male version. And this is the female version the female version goes over top of the copper okay which is convenient the male version is the same size as the copper. And so this would be convenient if you're on a joint or using a coupling just thought i'd throw that out there for you to see. But what we're using is the female version. And because the part of the plumbing we're doing right. Now is kind of mid demo we're just getting this all capped off. So we can pull the tub out i could also use just a regular plumbing cap. And i can cap my plumbing that way too okay. But since we're going to be converting to pecs for the long haul what i'm going to do to save myself time for tomorrow is i'm just going to put six inches of pecs on there put on a test cap which is one of these little plastic caps here. And that'll be good for tonight. And then tomorrow we can just cut. And add the fittings when we're ready to run the plumbing. Now basically this comes already cleaned comes from the factory it's brass doesn't really tarnish. But what i like to do is scratch it up just a little bit. So that they have somewhere for the solder to sit into okay. So when i'm doing my torching if you haven't done torching before what i'm looking to do is i'm going to use this solder here we go you heat up the joint where you want the solder to go to which is up here. And you add the solder from the bottom all right. So what you want to do is create a nice clean scratched up environment. So the solder has somewhere to sit. And you're basically sealing it for the whole width of the joint all right. So you end up sealing it about 50 times more than it's necessary. And that is the goal to get such a good clean joint that there's no risk of it ever leaking. And then you can sleep at night you'll see when the fitting is hot enough the solder will melt on the opposite side of the pipe at the lowest part. And now you know when it's going in there we go pushed in. And it dripped out i know that whole thing is full of solder. Now i'm adding the heat the top left i'm adding solder for the bottom right. And heat goes up. So when it gets hot enough the melt solder in the bottom right i know it's been suck because i added the flux. And there we go it's been sucked all the way to the top. And that's it that soldering job is done. So i just ran into the car. And got my pex cutting tool just one out of breath it's too cold to be standing around in t-shirt i wanted to show you this two different fittings you use to cap the end of the line these are called test caps they're made of pl plastic. And this is the brass cap that's if you're going to have a line. And it's going to end. And you want to crimp that. And not ever think about it again for the rest of your life not using that today we will be using these. And they're wonderful you just slide them on okay get a couple of rings slide those on. And crimp it. And that's it. So we're going to just stick this on the line. And then crimp it all up okay. Now we torched that only 2 minutes ago. But i'm not concerned about if it's too hot this pec handles a lot of heat the way you do this is you would put this test cap on. And it has a little stub on it. And you bring your ring right up to the the end here. And that tells you that you're in the right place light on your crimpers. And done okay. So you want your ring about a quarter inch off the end of the pipe snug to the brass fitting boom. And this might see a little a little bit tedious. And frustrating. But it is a lot quicker. And a lot more flexible than doing soldering all right. So we are back here. Now to finish our conversion from copper to pex. And install our shower valve this is the typical shower tub system it has hot. And cold shut offs as well as it has integrated pex adapters. So that you can run pex directly to this. And the the tub line comes with a 3/4 inex adapter which solves all of the problems we've been experiencing this industry going to pex. And having dripping from the shower head when you do pecs to your tub. So what we need to do here is really simple it's just a matter of doing any of our our copper work first. So we can let everything cool down. And then we can just crimp everything together. So these systems come the tap just threads off like this just be careful this is all machine brass. And it is sharp you may want to wear gloves for this case this is just the test cap with the ring on it. And there we go that's our valve. So i'm going to suggest since i'm going to go with the copper option for the bottom i'm going to suggest that you take out the stops for the hot. And the cold just pinch them together. And slide that out okay. And give a tug there we go it's all one piece. Now the instructions that come with this do not tell you that it's required however experience says when you're using a soldering wet tool if you have anything on that fixture that's made of rubber you're probably best to get rid of it there we go. And that is why we put the drain cover [laughter] on there we are. So now there's nothing left here. But solid brass. Now as far as the height that you install your valve at it's completely optional consulting with this particular client  she has grandchildren that she uses to bathe in this tub. So she needs to be able to access the water while she's bent over at the tub. So it's not as low as traditional for a tub. But it's high enough that you can reach it without having to bend over while you're having a shower. So it's kind of the best of both worlds here. So before we get it started don't forget rule number one turn off the water drain the line just cuz you turn it off doesn't mean you're not going to have a mess that lines are pressurized. So i always drain the line first. So this valve is going to go on our center line which is about here if you're in a situation where you have more stud space peex is awesome they have these wonderful little holders. And you can actually bend it around to go to a 90 without using a crimp okay in our situation here though we're we don't have enough room to turn that. So i'm going to have to use an elbow. And since i'm using an elbow on the hot line there's no sense using this on the cold because i'm only going to be able to have as much pressure as on the hot side anyway in a shower. So the easiest way to hook up your plumbing is to use a laser level get your laser level on the center line. And then just mark all of your lumber where the line is okay all the way up to the shower head. And that's it. Now there's no more measuring involved done got to own a laser level if you run away at don't next thing is to rough in just to measure all your components we're going to temporarily screw this to the wall  good to know in this system the there's two holes for screwing it. And two holes for attaching the plate the ones that you screw to the wall with this manufacturer don't have any threading in them. So they're easy to identify i know some companies thread all the holes regardless. And this always drives you crazy. So we will put that there. And now for this you're going to need a/2 in coupling for the tub i like to use one of these bad boys because i can attach it to the wall it's a 90° elow that comes with the mount on it. Now way you measure is you measure the gap. And then add 1 in. So you get a/2 inch for each fitting. So we're going to go seven. So i need to cut an 8 in piece of pipe. And measure my 8 in with my thumb of course this is a rough toit if you're at all concerned you can just take off a little bit for good luck that's fine here okay leave that there for. Now and you also want to cut at the same time about a 5 in extension for the tub spo. Now the particular tub spo fixture that we have is a slip-on tub spo where the attachment happens near the wall you really only need about 2 in out of the wall i just like to go a little overboard. So that i'm guaranteed i'm not going to have any soldering on the pipe where i'm trying to slide it over the tub fixture later okay because we're dealing with copper. And we're dealing with our hands we're going to have oil on the line we just make sure we clean up the copper all the ends give them a good scratch with the sand cloth of course use the fitting brush inside all of the fittings give them all a good scratch including here. And you want to scratch up the valve as well before we continue we just want to get all of our torch products sitting here handy ready to roll one of the best ways to do your soldering is to have your fixture mounted somewhere. So that you don't have to be holding on to something that's going to get red hot  i like to wear my safety glasses when i'm torching because when i get my fixture soldered i like to use the brush with the the flux. And just give it a quick wipe okay guarantees a good seal. And you may get something flashing in your face. So that takes care of that. Now before we solder we want to assemble all right. So we want to get flex inside all of our fixtures all right. So i put this together temporarily for. Now i've got a screw in this elbow. So that while i'm heating things up in the in the. So and the sorry the  the flux goes kind of very liquid a lot of times these fittings will fall off. And i don't want all the stuff falling in behind the tub. So this will just anchor it all. And keep it all in place until i'm done i've thrown a screw here to get my waterline bent out of the way to keep it away from the heat. So now we're ready to do this i [applause] i know it looks a little archaic. But the fact is we're not welding we're soldering. So you know in a perfect world it's nice to have a nice little pretty joint. But my goal is to get the solder not at the joint is to get it inside at the fitting where we scratched it up. Now i got a scratched fitting in a scratch pipe. And solder stuck in all those little grooves that's what the flux does it's like a magnet. And it pulls all the solder into the inside of the joint where the heat is. So you heat where you want the solder to go. And then when it's hot enough to melt it it sucks it in. So although maybe a couple of points here you can might see what you think is a pinhole i'll guarantee you that is watertight. And before we close up the wall we will guarantee that it's watertight. And do a pressure test. So we're going to be okay real quick note don't worry if you get any of this  solder on your acrylic they do not bond together. And it will just wipe right off okay. Now because we have turned off the water right yeah i'm pretty sure. And drain the lines oh i'm pretty sure i'm confident cuz i'm looking over at the bathroom tap. And it's open. And nothing's coming out yeah all right yay all right. So what we're going to do is we're just going to measure how where we want to be here with the waterline with our thumb just a little bit below this again is eyeballing. And it might be easier if the blade is facing you sit it in the cradle. And this is you want to cut while you turn that's how you cut it straight without collapsing the pipe if you just cut it straight on you're going to crush the pipe out of shape like that. And then putting on the fittings is real pain in the button. So always add a ring as you go okay. And it's not going to stay where you want it to. And that's okay we also need to add enough to go from here to here i love the fact that this pex is covered in numbers because it makes it really easy to measure okay again we can put the rings on from ahead of time cuz we're going to have two joints all right. Now here's one of these situations everything is. So tight together that we can't connect it. Now we can take that off. And put it all in place. And then we'll throw another set screw on again just to keep it all still while we're working all right same with the other side twist. And cut the end is no good tost ring fitting two rings connect that eyeball it cut it all right there we go. Then we have to take our trusty crimpers. Now these are awesome i think the last time we did one of these copper toex videos we used a different locking system since. Then crim rite has come out with a crimping tool that is around $40 instead of 400. So it's finally making something that a homeowner can use. So you can use these solid rings to crimp. Now as a homeowner without a huge investment in your plumbing again this means that you can do your own plumbing. And the tools will be a lot cheaper than hiring a plumber. Now the goal here is to get the ring about a/ quar inch away from the fitting all these fittings have these little barbed rings on it. So as long as you're making solid contact on one of these rings you're going to be fine. But if you aim for the quarter inch rule you're sure to be good as gold [music] you know the scary thing is plumber state here using exactly the same system that seems like an awful lot of money to play with lego to pay for a plumber. Now don't get me wrong i love my plumber. And there's a time. And a place to call in a professional. But when they make plumbing systems this simple man man oh man you better learn how to do this yourself or you just throwing away your money. Now what we're going to do is we're going to take our valves. And we're going to put them back in in the clos position which is straight up. And down. And we will put back our clips. And this is a pretty simple system to install little bit of a push push that down. And then close them into the into the cradle you probably see it easier on this side eh just got to push it in right drop this in there okay we are good to to go the last thing to do here of course is we have to put in the shower system just thread this on again go backwards until you feel it sit right nice. And gentle in case you're cross threaded there we go i know i mentioned this when i was taking this apart. But i'm putting it back on you've got to use a pair of gloves here you're supposed to do this hand tight you can use a wrench just for a quarter turn. But hand tight is plenty. But wear gloves all of these machine lines here if your hand slips at all it'll just slice it to shreds all around the inside of your palm. And i learned that one the hard way all right. So now we're at a point where we got we got our hot. And cold water supplies all crimped on the shut up valves are back in our cartridge is back together our tub supply is all installed. And kept. Now it's time to do the shower. And this is just a pex toex this is a drop beer connection again put it on your line. And tighten it down to the board. So i'm just going to eyeball it to the perfect cut add a little a little bit that'll never hurtt wonderful thing about packs is you can always cut it a little bit long because you can bend it in place. And then just drop it down get your crimping tool set that to a/4 inch well we. Now have plumbing. Now let's go turn the water supply on. And double check everything please can all right. So my son's downstairs turning on the water supply what we do is we get on the phone together. So that i i can communicate with him if we have any leaks. And the first thing we're going to do is with the the taps closed we're going to check our solder joint here. And our connections leading up to the valve. And we have no initial issues can you go full pressure please all right. And we're all pressurized okay come on upstairs buddy okay. So now here's a great little invention that i get at my pluming supply store  i haven't seen these in the hardware store before. So if you're looking for one you might want to go to a specialty supplier. But this is just a simple little cap has a gasket on it an extended pipe. So that it's easier to cut wallboard. And identify things when you're doing your tile work. But it just threads into your shower head spout okay it's exactly the same diameter as the fixture itself. And you just tighten that on nice. And tight. Now you can test the pressure in the whole line because i'm capped up here with this. And i'm capped down here with the solder. So now we're going to open up the cold water supply perfect we are all finished our plumbing roughing system. Now the final trim goes on after the tile. And that's also where the cartridge gets installed in here the reason they have the shut off valves on this bracket is. So that you're not mixing hot water through the cold water line i know that there are some systems out there that  come with a test cap that don't have the locks. And i've had situations like that where you install your shower. And before you know it a couple days later the toilet's running hot water while you're busy tiling. And such. So these are designed to keep the water from flowing until you get the rest of the system put together. And that's about all you need to know. So in a lot of cases when we're working in a job site. And we're changing the tub or tub surround the idea here is to try to minimize the scope of work unfortunately in this situation the client wanted to go from a standard 30in wide to a 32 inch wide. And so that creates a lot of little nuances that we're going to cover in this tub installation video because if you can install a larger tub into an existing smaller space you can to stop any tub on the planet okay. So let's get started i just wanted to point out first before we get moving about the quality of the of the tub that we're using this is a mirland tub it's called the tucson the 32 in is called the tucson this has got an acrylic tub. But it's a sprayed fiberglass reinforced acrylic okay this is a extremely strong. And it's it's a little bit more advanced than some of the products are available on the shelf of the building store. So keep an eye out for this because the price point is really minimal for an extra $30 or $40 you can get a high quality acrylic tub instead of something that's going to have a lot of deflection. And risk cracking over time okay. So you'll notice that this is a little piece of chipboard plywood reinforced all sprayed. And glued together. But this is the skirt. And this is the translates a lot of the load on the front side of the tub. And when this is all sprayed together with the fiberglass it makes it incredibly strong you'll also notice on the back side there are a series of wooden block feet here. And that directly translates the weight of the tub when it's full of water to the subfloor underneath. So that you don't risk getting any cracks around the drain without those feet this ends up opening up. And splitting a lot of times. And this crack here is not a crack that you can fix with the repair guy okay they might come. And fix it for you. But it will crack again. So the only way to avoid that is to buy a tub that has these reinforced feet don't rely on the skirt to take care of all the weight you need to give support to the bottom of the tub. So the one thing you need to take care of before you start the idea of putting in a larger tub than what you have. Now is you need to understand which direction your floor joyes are running if you don't have access from underneath to see exactly the proximity of them you run the risk of this there could be a floor joist right here. And if that's the case when you open this up remember your your tub drain is going to be moving to a new center location. And if it's right on the where the joist is. Then you're not going to be able to put that install there without compromising your joy strength. And that's a brand new world. Now you can do this. But you need to get that engineered. And it's a really big expense otherwise you're going to have creaks. And cracks. And movement going on maybe damage in the ceiling underneath. So the way you can check that out is go to the heat register vent in the bathroom put your arm down the hole. And see which way the elbow goes okay which way the elbow goes will be the same direction as the joist if they're running this way into the tub you're going to have lots of room in your cavity to move your plumbing to the new location guaranteed. So the other thing you need to keep in mind is the framing around the tub remember when you're framing around a tub traditionally you're going to want to have wood backing off the corner of the tub. So you can attach your your overhead shower rod or even future if you're going to put in glass or a door kit you want to have wood there you don't want to rely on the strength of the wallboard. And the tile to support that. So we want to make sure we reframe we also want to add whatever blocking at the same time for our shower features the less work we do after the tub is installed the better  outside of that i think if we've cut all the basics covered make sure to check the level of the floor when they built the house originally it may have been level. But every house settles in the middle because it's wood it'll all shrink just a little bit there's almost guaranteed to be a slope. And if you want your tub perfectly level you're going to have to do some shimming. So keep that in mind as well. So there's really three things that we need to do when we're putting a larger tub into an existing smaller hole one is we have to open up the subfloor to reconnect the drain two we have to eliminate this all this plumbing. And start all over again. And the third thing is we have to cut back the tile. And the underlayment. So the tub can fit in inside of that area like i said when the house gets a little older it tends to slope in the middle. And if i try to level this tub. Now i'll be flush on the outside wall. And i got almost a half an inch gap difference here by cutting all this back. And creating a new line i can install this tub. And have nothing. But a silicone joint available to the naked eye later. So what we've done is we've opened up a bit of a can of confusion here what i thought was the pipe leading for the drain turned out to be the pipe only going to the vent this drain pipe actually does a p trap comes back here down through the joist. And then back to the drain which you know contradicts what i definitely would have done as far as my process. But that's fine what i've done is i've gone out. And i've bought this brass drain kit. And the reason i bought this is because of the flexibility i need to move my drain to a new location around here. But all of the fittings in this plumbing here are joint to joint to joint. And although i able to take that off it's just really labor time consuming. So this enables me to change from this pipe over i can put on this new te that's a brass put this pipe to where it goes center i can come off the existing pipe right here. And i can actually snake in the corner of this pipe here which is awesome. So i can get that extra inch. And a half out of it just by bending my copper neck this enables me to do all my plumbing have it leak proof. And it's a lot quicker. Now it's only an extra $15 more than the aps drain system. So i suggest buying this all the time you don't always need to use it. But when you do need to use it it's nice to already have it all right. Now in order to cut this all out i'm going to be pulling out my handy dandy rigid inch. And a half pipe cutter try to get as much of this pipe cut as i can. And you just stick it on the pipe it has a sharp tooth on it. And it slices through the abs. Now if i'm lucky. And i put it right up to the fitting go at it from both directions it'll almost complete the cut. Now the secret to doing good plumbing is cutting perpendicular. And trying to cut in here with this saw might be a little tricky. And i could always lay it right in here. And fish it back. And forth. But it's a little too big. And cumbersome. So i went out. And i bought myself this cute little hacksaw for just occasions like this i can actually get in here. Now this is going to take a minute. But it'll get the job done. And then once you get 3/4 of the way through it'll generally just give up the ghost okay. So you don't need to clean abs fittings with sand cloth. But i can't see what's going on in behind there. So i'm just making sure that i've got any of the old solvent out of the way. So all i got to do generously apply the solvent to both pieces. And without wasting too much time push. And twist get that on there nice. And tight okay. So now we just got to prep up our brass drain kit this is all compression fits with some positions there's gaskets some of it's just thread like here. So when it's just thread i use a pipe joint compound this acts like a sealer me put that back in where it came from nice. And tight okay. Now these other joints it's just a washer. And a nut system all right. So what we're going to do. Now is just measure off where this goes we'll loosen up this collar. And we have the ability to raise or lower this okay according to the dimensions on the tub which is awesome you'll see how this operates here you put the ring on first. And then the washer okay goes in afterwards okay. So we slip this over. And it's a nice snug fit. And the thing here is we. Now have to cut this pipe to fit all right that's not my final location before we put the lift of the tub out we mark the center drain on the floor all right. And so we got the dimensions on that is nine off the wall. And 17 off that wall. So what i do is i'm going to go in here. Now let's see what this pipe is that is nine that is not 17. So in order to get it over to this location i've got to make this pipe shorter. So we want to do is go like this. Now and we're measuring to the center hole eyeball this bad boy yeah that's going to be good there okay. So i eyeball that's about the edge of where my pipe goes you can see that inside this fitting there is room for that pipe to be extended okay i'll mark it just. So you can see i have a half in of play. So if that's what i'm guessing i'm going to split the difference i'm going to go to quarter inch of play i also have the ability for this to move around just a little bit on me. So that'll make it real easy to install the tub okay all right. And then we just take the hacksaw. And cut that off this is one of these cases we having some sand cloth is brilliant makes it a lot easier to put the fitting on okay. So we're in put the ring on put the gasket on this is snug it's really difficult to do with the gloves on there we go to people okay here we are. Now again we're just still doing the rough fit here we haven't connected or tightened up any of the fittings 17 right there. And right there. And right there okay. Now the other thing we have to do is find out how far off the ground that tub is going to be because we were using this type of drain system we were actually able to tie into the original abs that was coming out  we've locked on the collar adjusted all of our pipes we created our center point here of 17 and9. And we created our center point here just according to the dimensions on the tub well the only thing left to do. Now is just cut back the tile i've got a beautiful porcelain tile bit on here i picked this up in my tile supply store cost me 35 bucks you can get something comparable in the harbor store for about 60. And we're just going to run the vacuum. And cut this out make sure you protect yourself you're going to flying stone going everywhere hit [music] it there we go lots of material that's good there i like that. So m just going to install some vapor barrier here for us he got a great little trick it looks like for doing this if you're a little short there you go i like that i'm going to use that one day. So we have got our extra framing in the wall we've got our drain done we've got our floor cut back. So that we're ready to drop the tub in [applause] i'll leave it for the tall kid here. So we're ready to install our tub",https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=1541,[]

So we're ready to install our tub finally we've got our plumbing rough in tied into the wall our drain is assembled our floor is cut back our framing is done the vape barrier is intact. And we're gotten all this point without expanding the scope of work outside of the fact that we we had to cut the floor. So so far it's a good day all right. Now there is no one way to do this you are going to have to do a little bit of trial. And air just remember the back side. And the each end are open. So you have the ability to do a little bit of twisting. And rolling when you're trying to get these into position the key is to hold it off the ground the entire time until you're ready to set it down the last few inches. So you don't accidentally put too much pressure on one of the corners of the skirt which will always be visible. And if you break that you got to go buy a new tu okay there we go. So we're flush up against this there's our drain that'll be perfect this is on the flexible connection. So we can put that in place later. So now that we have our tub in place. And we're solid we want to connect all of the plumbing before we connect the tub to the walls. And i'll tell you why because the plumbing has only got. So much flexibility down here  i want to get this one mounted the drain. And then i want to connect the overflow which is on the flexible neck. So that'll work out really well what we got is you got to take care of one thing here. And that is this protective plastic. Now i'm only mentioning this because everybody who's ever got into building things. And putting in plumbing for the first time until you've had a leak. And you found out it was because this plastic was in the way you don't know that you need to remove it. So i'm going to save you that problem get the plastic out of the way you don't want to have any of that protective plastic where you're putting your fixtures. So you want to get your white silicone that's designed for kitchens. And bass. And you want to get it on your thread here. And a couple of lines. And you want to put it just a thin layer around the seal here on their first attempt of doing this series of plumbing in the bathroom we had a few plumbers came in. And they chined in with the fact that this particular style of acrylic tub is not conducive with the oldfashioned plumber putty. And apparently there's some concern that the putty will break down the acrylic over time. So they suggest using this bathroom silicone. So now you take your tub tool. And we're causing compression on that rubber gasket that's underneath up to the top surface we're just going to lift that up until it's nice. And tight here we go once we have it snug we'll throw a screwdriver across the top. And give an extra extra half a turn all right. Now at this point wipe out the extra silicone it's not necessary to be in there anymore. Now we got that one done i always put my drain cap in right away make sure it's covered up. Now here's my overflow. And i'm just going to reach him behind. And put my gasket back in place. Now very difficult to install the tub. And not knock this off. Now you can see i'm a little bit low i'm just going to tug on that neck extension until i'm right where i want it. And this is where this kit comes in real handy a lot of overflow systems  they have a little bar. And you tighten it up with a drill. And you just got to get it in the right spot. And you may or may not have it good contact this one actually has a threaded cap that goes over top. And so this one here gives you the ability just go backwards until you feel it sit in. And then you go forward that way you won't cross thread i'm actually not in there right there we go if after you turn it a couple of times. And it's giving you a lot of resistance you might be cross thread. So just back it off. And try it again. Now you can use the tub tool here as well okay as a screwdriver you can see on here there's a couple of prongs gives you something to tighten it up against. And you're just going to find that middle point because the back of that overflow is flexible it'll not just move up. And down. But also twist side to side. So that you can get a perfect compression right there okay. Now if at any point you're you're concerned at all about leaking you can as a management tactic you can actually silicone around that this plastic to the acrylic can be silicone. And create a secondary seal. But the finish on this actually has this really cool little thing it's a little different look from os andb. And it has a slotted groove that goes over top of the edge of that. Now how sak is that not seen any screws very sexy. Now it's inevitable whenever you're installing a tub  one of the things we joke about in our business is we never find a room that's square you'll never find an al cove that's square. So once you've done drop in some shims all the way around the tub. And that is where you will put your screws to attach the tub to the wall once you've done attaching it cut off the shims remove them out of the way if you're concerned at all about  the acrylic breaking you can actually get a pilot drill. And just drill a small little hole before you put your screw i suggest flooring screws because they're coated. And they won't rust as fast. But if you really want to go crazy you could always buy stainless steel. And here we go once we've got that all set up that's more than one shim thick here we go these are actually acq these are deck screws. But they'll do the same thing. And you'll see it get started. And it'll drill its own hole. And you can run it almost flush okay don't go too crazy with this because you will crack it. And that's all you need yeah perfect. So once you get that in here we go. Now we got this tub is,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=4211,"['What type of material was used for the protective plastic around the plumbing fixtures?', 'Why did the plumber recommend removing the protective plastic?', 'What type of silicone should be used for the acrylic tub?', 'How does the overflow system work?', 'What is a common issue when installing a tub in an alcove?']"
4612.0,5783.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,DIY How to Renovate the Tub / Shower from A to Z,NS6TPiHaN2Y,DIY How to Renovate the Tub / Shower from A to Z: Installing Schluter Kerdi board,ebf425e5-c57d-04bc-fb39-d4f40315e39b,In here we go. Now we got this tub is installed okay. So in the building world today we've got a lot of different materials available for building. And waterproofing a shower  i believe in one of our previous videos we showed you how to use just regular drywall. And use the ctie membrane that orange mat. And cement that on the walls. And create your seal for waterproofing. But in this video today we're going to show you a little different system because ctie makes its own wall panel. And this is half an inch thick it's a polystyrene it's got the waterproof membrane on it. And it just reduces everything down into one step one of the benefits of this board is that you can actually use it to create your own custom niche. And you can cut the hole after you've installed your wall while you're tiling to create that shelf right on the gr line we're not doing that in this particular project we'll do that again some other time for you today we're just covering how to install it. And the basics of it. So the stuff comes in 3ftx 5t panels or 4x 8t sheets i've double checked it's available at both of the major building stores the only downside is neither of them carry the cy fix cocking. So if you download the instructions or look online for how to do this properly you're going to be disappointed they do not carry the cocking i'm not exactly sure why it's not exactly needed. But we'll leave that to shoter to answer that question. So what i've done is i've just pre-cut my panel i prefer to buy three 4x 8t sheets. And because when i do the math i have a 5 foot. And then a 3ot a 5ft. And a 3ot. And then control wall. So that's three panels it's nice. And simple. And i never have an issue if i buy the 3t x 5t i've got to buy three sheets just for this wall cuz usually this wall is 6 ft. And change. And that's maddening all right. Now here's the deal this board is cut at 5t. And my hol is a little bit bigger. And that's fine they come with hardware this wonderful little clip system. And that clip right there it's got teeth in it okay. And so what happens is you put it on the polystyrene you press it in the screw goes in the middle into the stud. And then it you screw it until there's a depression all right. And the way this works is that depression gets filled with cement. And a waterproofing membrane layer little 2x two square. And that is the entire system as soon as you put that on this is built like a submarine it can go 10 stories beneath the ocean's level. And no water is going to get in there. Now these clips are supposed to be installed every 12 in on the stud every 16 in apart your bathroom may or may not be framed like that exactly not to worry it's a very rigid board. So you can get away with a little bit of slack. Now in our particular case our framing is quite odd because we are backtack showers here. So i'm going to have a larger cavity. So i'm going to take advantage of this stud even though it's really quite close oh love the phillip screws because these boards have got these wonderful grid lines on them. And we're just doing a substrate nothing has to be exactly perfect it makes life really easy i can actually put that board there eyeball it mark my spot. And i can just cut the whole board without any straight lines all right breaks a lot like drywall. And it just has another membrane on the back that's very similar without the lines. So you just cut it. And then you shave it. Now if you're transporting these large sheets in your car all you'd have to do is cut across the back side snap it over. And you can make it half as thick to shove in your car. And then you open it up to install it. And you still have a continuous joint on the membrane which means you still have a waterproof fl. So that's very handy trick to have just for get started we'll throw a couple of washers in go about a foot down there we go that'll lock that in place time for the next board this is an awesome way to measure we can just go over here identify where the other board is. And then we go over here all right. So we just eyeball this take an extra quarter off you don't need to be flushed to the ceiling with your wall board all right it's okay you have your board a little bit short as long as you're only doing a shower. Now if you're sealing it all up to do a steam shower you also have to waterproof the ceiling at that point it's not going to be an issue. But for standard shower if your wall board's a little bit short. And i say go for it make ease of convenient look how easy that is to install no fight put your clip right on the joint. And compress the joint together. And go like that. Now when the last step just as we're about to tile we're going to mix up our non-modified cement. And we're going to do a cy tape joint along these joints here. And we're going to cover all of our screws with little squares. And then that's the entire waterproofing system. So remember all you need to know is you keep these things every 12 in up. And down the studs try to put them on every stud that you can find or 16 in on center use these special things at the joints. And a utility knife to cut. And you can waterproof like a pro. So i found that one of the best secrets is get the two long walls on first leave the control wall till last crawl in here. And then just measure off your finished wallboard to the center of the plumbing fixture which oddly enough turns out to be 16. And because we use a laser level all three will be the same. Now we want to measure from the top of the integrated tile flange that is six. And then 17 i want to get all my measurements at once. And just have them handy. And that's 65. Now all we're going to do is translate that information onto this board. So around here that's my center line that's my center line okay. So i'm at 6 in. And i'm at 6 17 in. And i am at 65 in okay. So now i got all my measurements all i need to make my holes is a utility knife. Now if you like you could use a hole saw seems a little extreme. And i'll tell you why up here we're going to have a shower head. And it's just a/2 in pipe coming through the wall. And the water starts here. And goes down. So the likelihood that up here gets wet very very small. So you can cut yourself a nice moderately sized hole just to for convenience sake okay. And there we go that's for the shower head down here i've got a shower control. Now my cover pl pan is about 5 in round. And it has its own gasket that seals up against the stone. So i'm not really that concerned about getting in behind that part of the wall either. So i have a rectangle that i want to cut that is about 3x3 in that's where i'm going to [music] start okay. And then for the tub spout of course same thing it's just a/2 in piece of copper. And so just to help make it simple i'm going to cut about a 1in hole. And then we're just going to slide it all into place all righty okay. Now the secret here to knowing where your wood is is you go down to your tub. And you just look for the screws because that's not just attaching your tub that's marking it all right. And that is how you know where your stud is. So i only have a screw here. And here i'm going to fill those two lines i'm going to screw the outside edge as well. But because the old drywall is sticking out a little bit i'm going to take a minute with my utility knife. And cut that back before i close it up. And tighten it up till the dimples there you go. So now all i have to do is go along finish all of my screws every 12. And 16. And i have to cut a couple little strips to go inside the tub down to the floor oddly enough that is the one part of the bathroom that seems to rot out the fastest it's the most important. So make sure you keep some spare material around just for that position. And once we mix up the cement we'll show you how to waterproof this. So here we are we got all of our board installed. Now it's all the clips are in you can see where we use the clips on the joints. So you can kill two birds with one stone the only thing that's really left to do is to finish the waterproofing process by closing up these joints. So that they're waterproof. Now if you're not familiar with the schutter product this is their joint tape it's kind of similar to doing drywall really we're going to just cover it over. Now you need to use the right kind of cement. And so with anything that's waterproof it means it resists water i want to use a product that is going to  get harder. And harder. And harder over time the longer it stays wet. So since the water isn't going to get absorbed into the wall i use a non-modified cement which is old fashioned for cement. And i use that to make all these adhesions because i found that trying to use any other product it just starts to peel off. So i know schutter makes their own all set product. Now that's good for any application that's rather expensive you can just buy a regular boring non-modified cement. And it'll save you a ton of money really simple this stuff is actually  it is a plastic it's a woven cloth. But it's difficult to cut with a utility knife. So be really careful you're actually better to use scissors when working with this kind of stuff. And of course if you need to know how to mix cement you can check out some of our other videos we've done on the schutter waterproofing system. And tile videos as well. Now let's get into this this is really kind of straightforward i'm going to actually demonstrate back here. Now i installed this board a little bit shy on purpose okay as a demonstration this is not meant to be rocket science really we're just going to put this membrane up to the ceiling. And we're going to just physically measure it right down to where it overlaps right down to the top. And like i said this stuff is a little tricky to cut yeah. So you might want to use some scissors the idea here is that we install this we want to have it come down over top of the integrated tile flange all right. So that our waterproofing goes right down. And diverts everything right down to the tub deck. And then into the tub if any water gets in behind the wall. So just as a note if you're buying this stuff at the local building store. And you don't want to spend a lot of money on tools you can just use your regular 4-in knife just apply it pretty liberally. And don't try to squeeze it out when you're putting it on. Now schutter does make its own tools. So you can get all the thicknesses exactly correct. But honestly as long as you're just little liberal with this you'll be just fine. Now you take your membrane cloth. And you fold it over in half. And just run it off the tub a couple of times. And that is a great way to put a seam on that cloth. And it'll aid in the installation. So you're not fighting with it the whole time to put it into the corner. Then you can just place that in there bam just to reiterate the waterproofing system operates because this product. And this product both repel water. So water can't force itself behind that joint once that's dry there's just not enough space for water to get a foothold. And they've tested this stuff out something like four stories beneath the ocean floor of the amount of pressure it takes to force water through that joint. And since we're not in the ocean we'll be fine. So the recommendation from scooter of course is to have about a 2in overlay this tape is 4 in wide. And there we go that's installed. Now that joint is completely waterproof. So butt joints are pretty much the same course you're going to make a mess with this stuff. So don't worry about it you can clean it up later again you want to have a 2-in overlap over there there we go okay. Now as far as the cost of this product is concerned i'll be honest with you if you're using this product it's because you want your bathroom to be waterproof  hell or high water okay this is this is not cheap product. And it really works. But to give you an idea one roll of this at 16 ft is $30 each one of these 4x8 sheets is $1 $110. So you're looking at a5 or $600 investment in materials alone just to waterproof. And build your shower of course if you're putting on expensive stone. And you want it to last a long time this is a great way to make a heavy use kind of shower lasts forever the way that we f finish the waterproofing of the system is everywhere where we have a penetration we need to seal it up as well. And so we're going to add the cement put these little squares over top of the hole. And press them all tight. Now that area there has the same degree of waterproofing as the joint again guaranteed walk away never going to have an issue generally speaking if you're a homeowner. And you're buying this product at a building store there's one thing you can't buy because they don't sell it. And that is the cy fix. And it's a adhesive cocking this is not it part of their warranty program requires you to use that at the base of the tub to seal the wallboard to the tub. Now they don't sell it at the hardware stores neither of the two major brands do. So you're already buying a product that you can't get a warranty for. And so you've got to be creative to create that seal. So i have found. And we did this on a couple of projects earlier we made a cedar cooler for my deck we're using the leage 2in1 sealing bond this is made for interior use. So the fumes aren't very terrible. And you can use this to seal up your gap of the at the tub there's another way you can do this you can also cheat. And seal up these holes you're going to love this. Now this doesn't dry very fast. So if you use it you need to give it a couple hours to dry. But i'll give you an example of what happens here one tube of cocking is $9 one sheet of this is 30 bucks plus cement. And plus plus sealed waterproof i don't know about you. But if i wasn't in a hurry i would do this all day long come back. And tile tomorrow because the design is made for a 2-in overlap at 40 ft below sea level since we're only waterproofing something in the back of a shower you don't have to be all that concerned with the math if you're even close as long as that hole is covered even by a quar of an inch i'm telling you right. Now you're not going to have a problem. So don't get all paranoid about it. So since you don't have any c fix. And you've got to find a creative way to solve this problem you could use the membrane right over under the tub or you can just take your cocking here. And this is of course a special material that'll bond to just about anything. And you can just run a nice thick bead along the bottom okay bam. And then just smooth it out with your thumb a little bit get a little pressure in there. So you know bonded all around the corners you can do up the side as well. And that is it all right for closing up our shower we're going to be using a 4x12 glossy ceramic tile this is a brilliant product because it has lots of flexibility great style. And easy easy easy to install as long as you can get your first row level that is why it's very important to have your laser level handy i can't preach enough about this every it's tool that every homeowner should have in their in their toolbox. So before we get started  one quick tip make sure that you've peeled back your protective layer of plastic off your top lead you don't want to let that get caught underneath your tile or that will end up causing you problems down the road. And always have a pale of water with a sponge handy i like to clean as i go it just makes my life a lot easier. And if you're doing this professionally for people every time they pop their head around the corner. And see you working it is. So encouraging for them to see a nice clean job s. So the beginning of the tile job is always the same it's called mapping it out you need to think about how you're installing your tile. Now our basic direction here is to start with a 50% offset. So it's a typical subway pattern just a offset from the stack in the middle. So what we want to do is first measure our back wall off put a center line on. And this back wall should be 59 in. And so that should leave us at 292 which is right here. So the process here is simple we just take a couple of tiles we start with a grout line on the center line we work towards the outside. And you'll see that we are left with about a half a tile that is brilliant. And because we're staggering 50% every other row will be half tile full tile. And of course the same math if we start in the middle of the tile we'll be left with a full tile at the edge side. So what i'm doing is i'm checking to see how level my wall is all together. And i am going to be good there. So if i use that as my starting row right there. And then i cut a bunch of tiles in half i can start building the entire back wall from this corner off that line. And that is brilliant if you don't have a laser you can always just use a regular level. But of course this never lies and,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=4612,"['What type of materials are available for building in the world today?', 'How does one waterproof a shower using the CTIE membrane and cement?', 'What are the benefits of using the cy fix cocking with the Schutter product?', 'How do you measure and cut holes for plumbing fixtures in a shower wall?', 'What is the recommended method for sealing gaps between the tub and the wallboard?']"
5783.0,7175.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,DIY How to Renovate the Tub / Shower from A to Z,NS6TPiHaN2Y,DIY How to Renovate the Tub / Shower from A to Z: How to Tile Your Shower,1b2581e8-830e-c426-1605-e70ab226f686,Can always just use a regular level. But of course this never lies. And okay. So in this case the right side is pretty straight the left side actually opens up. So this tells me that if i'm going to go with half offset i should start in this corner. And then whenever i get to my end. And i have to cut a tile i can always cut it to fit without wrecking my pattern. So i've also set this up here you can see the laser line in this wall here max i'll get out of the way this is the laser level we're going to use. Now this tub is installed flush on the subfloor. And the house has got a bit of a dip. So the tub isn't exactly level. And that is not going to be a problem cuz this is the drain end. Now i've got it set up for full tile here as i come around the corner you'll see that really soon bam right there i'm already at my line. So the way i map this out. And the reason i want the laser level here is i want to cut all of these pieces for the bottom rope first to fit up against this laser level. And then i can use my wedge spacers. And make sure i got a perfectly light straight line here before i start building the wall if you just start tiling. And you've got a little slope you're going to have a hard time getting all your joints in the corners to line up because the tile will be sticking in every direction as it follows the slope if you don't start level you can't finish level it may not look bad to you when you're sitting in here building it when you walk in the room after you're all finished it'll scre scream at you hey that's crooked. And we don't want that. Now the easiest way to do this is just mark the wall okay. And then you take a look at your laser level. And you can put your tile to your laser level over here sorry that wrong corner there. And here. And when you put that on the tile cutter you just line up the two lines on the cutting line score. And snap. So now that our tiles are cut. And ready to build the first row before we get started we want to get our plastic edges on this will determine how what the actual outside measurement is going to be. And really the secret here is just get a little something you can press that edging into all right you can attach the rest of this later there we go we go. Now we can just set up our laser starting down at the baseboard. And you just push that over until it's exactly where you want it to be very nice. Now you can see the tile that we've chosen here has got a beautiful honeycomb on the back of it which means that i can go with a/4 by 3/8  travel this puts a really nice thick ridge on there great for collapsing those ridges. And getting good adhesion. And the secret here is push that tile shut without a gr line all right. And then you slide it into position. Now i've got a couple of different spacers here today i've got a 1/8 spacer i like subway tile with a little bit of gap. And a little bit of gro i just look it's a lot more classic. And then these are wedges all right. And these wedges are designed to help get this perfectly level. And also create a little bit of a gap between the tile. And the ac tub remember acrylic when it gets full of water is going to be bending around a lot. So you don't want to have it in direct contact cuz it'll cause squeaking. So we just put a wedge underneath create that air space. And we can remove later before we grow. And you can also use it to level it. And then establish your space with your spacer for your grout line there we go it is that simple okay. So because we have our edging already installed oh boy. Now i like to take these little wax bits off as as i go i don't like to leave it until it's all the tiles installed in case there's an accident. Now i'm going to be putting it tight to that. And then marking minus two gr lines all right hopefully matt that'll cut get i got my son helping me today he's doing all the cutting no pressure one of the reasons why i think  subway tile is a perfect do-it-yourself job is because the the tile is small enough. And because it's made of ceramic it's very easy to cut. And you can use just a score tool which puts a scratch. And then pressure it always snaps right on the line matt just did this one. And that's a really nice cut that is really clean all right you can do that that tool is available at the building store for about $30 that's awesome you can always get a wet wet saw as well. But for this tile i would use a score tool almost exclusively. And then for around this area just get a  a ceramic bit for your 4in grinder. And you can just use that with. And cut any decorative hole you need. And that's about the only tools you'll ever need for this there we go let's add our grow line. Now you see that the edge of this tub has a bit of a raise to it which means that i'm not level. And that's what wedges are for. So i'm going to get that line level first based off my laser. And then i'm going to use my wedges to raise the rest of my line. So the reason i switched to laser level for doing my tile is because i would end up getting my my level. So filthy from always laying it in the mud. And i couldn't get a proper line unless i cleaned all the cement. And started over again it drove me nuts. So this way i have a perfect line all around the entire tub not just from corner to corner. And that helps make sure the job is perfect every time okay. So we just set up our laser level down here to have a look right on the edge of the tile. And so down here i am just just hovering above the stone okay. And then over as i come across it's the your eye will play tricks on you i think that was level it looked good it was a straight line. But it wasn't a level line. So this is why these wedges are. So awesome i can actually make this adjustment until it is absolutely perfect okay all right. So now we have our first row established i'm pretty happy with what's going on with it oh spacer came up remember we already checked with our laser levels we know that straight up is perfect we cut a bunch of tiles in half. So we're going to just start with a half tile there. So now it's just like building a pyramid right get your cement on the wall. And this is going to be messier than when you're using an adhesive. So always have that pale. And sponge handy clean as you go try to keep the extra cement out of the gr lines as much as you can just run your travel on long there like that or even both your fingers okay what you're going to do is just place them right on the tile first okay start with two rows at a time here. So we just lift the tile drop in our spacers. And because we've got the the row all leveled off just do the ends you don't have to put them everywhere just to support the tile to keep it from sliding around okay. And that's it. Now we want to straighten out our line here always put your cuts on the inside of course press it in lift it up. And do the spacer. Now getting lots of cement where you need it i like to start at the bottom. And then lift it up. So i'm pulling the cement away from the gr line. And then just do over. And over. And over again start tight to the tile okay this one slipped off the laser. And you can keep an eye on this. And adjust it as you go after about  half an hour these tiles on the wall are not going to be able to move anymore with this type of cement okay. So you got a little bit of time to play with this nice. And tight. And the reason you go nice. And tight it's a great way to check to see if everything's square. And level if i put this on nice. And tight i got a huge gap i know i've got to fix something okay. So we're just going to set the space up. Now for good measure once we have our line here established put these spacers back into. And that'll make sure that all of your gr lines all over the wall are uniform you don't have big gaps. And little gaps opening up next to each other that always looks unsightly. Now during the introduction i mentioned that we're doing a subway tile with the glass mosaic. So now it's time to discuss the glass mosaic. And why it's necessary most of the tile that's produced today is produced under the assumption that you're having a 5ft shower which is why these are just under 12 in plus the gr line full five tiles across looks very aesthetically pleasing easy to center easy to install plus they're also made at a certain height. So that on a traditional 20in tub which is. Now the norm. And a regular 8t ceiling it's just about a full full tile at the top maybe a little bit more maybe a little bit less. But nonetheless it'll finish well with either a little grout or a little grind. And it'll look like a full tile after the silicone edge goes on what you need to know is what if your situation is a little bit different. And it's going to be just a sliver what if you end up with just one inch of tile left what if your house is a little short or you got a bulkhead or you bought a shorter tub. And the math doesn't work how do you fix that. And this is what we do there are bazillion options of mixed mosaic tile different thicknesses 1t sheets like this with a reoccurring pattern okay what you can do is you just follow this simple procedure. And you can use your mosaic to make the adjustment on your finish before you get there. So you measure down from your ceiling all right we're just a little bit over under 32 in. So i check how's that going to look well i'm a little bit over 32 in to a full tile. So the tile at the very top of the ceiling i we'll use this i'm going to end up cutting about this much off in this particular situation this tile. And this tub work because i checked both sides already. And on the other side it's perfect. And on the side that's inside the house it's actually got a little bit of a gap. So i'm going to have a little bit of a cut line around the top just like it did around the bottom cuz remember i have a square house. And it went. And it fell in. So now all i had to cut the bottom row on the tile to make it level the top will get cut to be level. And it'll work out. But if you had a problem with that. And you were going from zero to 1 in filler i'll guarantee you that 1in piece of tile would look like garbage. So i'm going to back this up one row a tile instead of the 32 i'm going to go to 28. And a quarter that'll give me all the room that i need that's my mark. And i want to make my mosaic that thick. So now i take my sheet. And on the bottom i've got a thicker piece up here i've got a thinner piece i'm going to say okay. So i need a gr line if i use those it's too much if i go here it's too much if i go there it's just right okay what if i started at this end of the sheet that's not enough. So that's what i'm going to use i'm use the thick 1 2 3 4. And then i've got a reoccurring pattern here thick 1 2 3 4. So that means i'm going to get two linear feet per sheet i bought a couple extra sheets because i know this usually happens. And then we are going to put in that much mosaic tile all around. So that we finish with a full tile. And that is how you solve your problem this is a great way to fill in the differences if you're using large stone especially you can put in two bands if you want. Now traditionally we put it in around 5 ft in the shower okay. So stand in the shower measure up to 5t it's kind of like line of sight in the bathroom all right. So when you look around the glass should be right in front of your eyes that's all you need to know about mosaic tile of course this is glass. So cutting this can be a little tricky. And maybe we should go to the saw. And show you how to do that. So now i'm going to demonstrate how to cut glass mosaic if you have a wet saw it's simple just set it on the table slide it through. But if you don't. And you're going to be using a grinder wheel. And this is fine this is a nice porcelain grinder wheel  the trick here is actually cut from the backs side all right it reduces the the breakage. And the chipping on the front of the glass. And gives you a nice straight line. And because i'm going into a corner i have to have a straight line. So i'm just going to eyeball a straight line off this shorted tile here [applause] no okay. So i want to what you'll see is i'm not cutting through it i'm pressing down the middle of the tile. And it's splitting. And watch this right here you can see the grinder only came to this point. And then it it cut right off okay we're going into a corner the other glass will come against it. And then that is all you need to do you you have to do 1 two 3 probably four of these cuts for the entire mosaic strip other than that the rest of these will fit together the way that it's on the sheet. Now in order to cut a hole in the middle of the tile. And this is important because you're going to be putting your tub faucet here. And the tub faucet may or may not be big enough to cover this plus the grout line. And you don't want it to be a place where the water can get through. So it's important to cut just enough hole for the pipe to come out what i'm going to do is i'm going to just lightly touch on all four of these lines okay. And then i'm going to finish the cut from the back side. And if you watch carefully i'll show you how it's done. And then when i'm done doing it i'll explain exactly how i did it all right. So you'll see i've started the cut on the glaze. And then what i do is from the back side i can see visually looking at this where the line is. And i use the grinder. And just make a just a quick line on the back of the stone. And that translates all that information to the back of the tile. Now i cut through from the back side [music] that gives me the ability to finish that cut without having the blade cross cutting right into the over the tile. And my tub spoke connection i have no problem covering that okay. So right. Now we're going to talk about the cy band te. And this particular cement. And why we're choosing this for our glass mosaic the funny thing is glass is usually heavier than ceramic relatively speaking. And they come preattached to the back of the sheet all right it's an adhesive. Now a lot of times these spaces that are in between this glass are different than the spacers that you're using on your wall. So for instance we'll take one of these oops. And here's my 1/8 spacer it barely makes it in there. But if i try to put it in between all of these tiles it actually doesn't fit overall these four joints this joint spacing is actually something like  25 instead of 216 it's a little bit strange. So the spacers are useless i can't use them. So if i'm building a wall like this. And i put in my mosaic strip i can use a spacer on the bottom. And i can stop there. And i can wait till tomorrow to come back when it's dry or i can use the right cement that's going to hold it up there even without spacers. And it's not going to slip i know it sounds ridiculous. But when you go to the hardware store you're stuck you have usually three choices of cement there's a  a modified. And non-modified modified means it has a glue in it. And then there's an ultra light which is good for putting tile on a ceiling  where i go for my tile products it's has the entire line the entire maape line of everything that's available. So i've got gray. And white options of modified. And unmodified for five different kinds of tile regular thin set large format tile  ceiling tile ultra light i mean if you can dream it up they've got theice product there. So when you're shopping for your cement if you get to a tile supply store instead of a building store you're probably going to be a lot more happy with your result. And a lot more options. So in something like this you can tile all the shower in a day or it can take an entire weekend. Now if you were to put two of these glass strips in there it could take you 3 days or you just buy the right cement for the job spend the extra couple bucks. And finish it all off in an afternoon let you be the judge. Now when i'm mixing cement generally speaking the first minute of mixing i want to have a little bit less product in there than i need just. So i can make sure i can clean out all the clumps that sit in the corners of course i always add water first there we go. Now i know that dent soup is going to be able to withstand all the rest of the smint that i pour in there all right [music] [applause]. So you only want to mix this once you don't want to wait in 10 minutes where you're supposed to allow it to set up. And then come back. And go o i need more water because it's not going to perform properly for you you just destroyed your cement. So you want to mix it thin enough just to the point where when you travel it it holds the travel groove. But it's still sloppy okay that way in 10 minutes from. Now when this is set it may be a little more firm. But it'll still perform well on the wall. Now we bought this cement to use on our mosaic. But because i like to be efficient i'm going to do the rest of the wall with it just cuz i don't like mixing just a little bit of cement in a pale. Now just a little demonstration here ready this is the cement that doesn't sag there you go yeah i'm using a 1/4x 3/8 travel that's a lot of cement on a wall good good adhesion about a 90% contact just by tossing it on the wall like that. And it wasn't slipping anywhere great product this is the white cement looks a little gray doesn't it. But this is the white. And the reason we picked the white is because the glass has just a paper on it. And then all the edges are behind the sheet will actually bring that color forward. So if we use a dark gray cement your white glass is going to turn really dark gray on you we don't want that before i put the glass on. And i'm just going to make sure that my edge here is nice. And clean. And this is important when you're doing glass make sure that this edge here is nice. And clean we're just going to start in the edge here. And the same as the other tie we'll start right on the base okay nice. And tight. And then i'm going to just lift it up. And what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my tool to lift. So i'm not pressing against the wall i'm just going to give it a little bit pressure voila that's not moving anywhere when i put the tile above it i'm going to get exactly the same result that's not going to move anywhere either i'm going to already put my grp line there done right. So for some of these trickier places it's hard to reach you can't get your travel in. And around this corner. And because i was busy building that other wall first i've let this dry feel free to just add your cement to the back of the tile okay be real liberal here hold your trel to about 75 80°. And then just just run that off you'll end up getting the same thickness as is on the wall okay just like that do all sides of the hole all right take the extra cement off. And then just fire it over there done okay. So the only other thing you need to know is this when you're done your tile work the next day you come back take all your spacers out all right take a wet sponge. And force it in all the lines. And clean them all out the cements that we're using here within 48 hours you can wipe them out pretty simply. And it'll actually clean up real nice without any tools or risk of damaging your tile also when you're doing the round the sides down the bottom of the tub you usually do that at the end of the job save some of this tea product okay from mat pie. And use that down there too. And then you can build back wards knowing that the tile is not going to slip. And make a big mess other than that patience patience patience keep your lines level get a laser level i can't stress that enough. And you'll have a successful tile job,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=5783,"[""['Can always just use a regular level.', 'So this tub isn\\'t exactly level.', 'The easiest way to do this is just mark the wall.', 'Now we want to straighten out our line here.', 'When you're done your tile work the next day you come back take all your spacers out.']""]"

And you'll have a successful tile job too okay. So before we start doing this  let me just talk about the parts real quick the reel pro system comes with a surface mounted plate. And this gets screwed to the roughing valve that's in the wall. And it has a gasket on the back that seals to the tile. Now depending on the tile condition you may or may not want to use a silicone bead after you're done a lot of times this sort of thing doesn't work if you're using a subway tile because there are inconsistencies with the surface texture. And the grove lines if it's a really large piece of stone. And you're cut right down the middle. Then this is plenty enough to seal it shut. So what you have to do is you want to take your long screw they come really big. And put it into the the wall. And just slide your fingers on it till you know the surface that's your surface depth that you have to put the screws into. And then you go look backwards until you see the next ring all right. And this is a soft brass. And you just take your side cutters all right. And you just give them a shot like that. And that one's cut to fit again just confirm that i did that right there we go back to there. And use your side cutters okay there we are. And now we have our plate. So we slide it over our valve trim. And we want to do this first before we add all the other pieces because we need the extra light going in there to find the holes okay. And just wiggle it around. And just put it fingertight for. Now there we go okay wonderful next thing you want to do is put on a glove because these brass fittings that they make for these shower valves are very very sharp. And find somewhere to put that it's not going to wreck anything take out the temporary test plug throw that in the garbage all right. So in this particular case. And you have to be really careful to check your instructions for all these things cuz every system is a little bit different in this particular case there is an extension that goes with the valve probably because the valve body is made really deep from this particular manufacturer. So that it can handle pressure balance multi-port plus thermostatic valve. So this is just an extension of this valve here. So these two pieces will sit together. And then this end here with the gaskets. And the pins will sit right in the cradle. So all you do is slide this stuff in. And there you go once you feel it sink into those two pins you're good all right. Now this is just the decorative chrome trim that goes over the brass fitting there is a hole near the front. And that goes on the bottom that's in case any water gets into that valve. And it has a way to drain that doesn't go in behind the wall all right another good reason why when you're installing your valve in the wall don't be afraid to install it just like one degre slope that way all the water that gets into that valve will drain out of the [music] valve. Now there's a gasket there we go we want to tighten up our [music] screws. And just snug don't overtighten it's just made of plastic. And you'll destroy it. And then after that you just set this on the name of the company reel goes at the bottom. And you snap it in place no screws. And if you ever need to remove it you can just get a good hold of it. And give it a good tug. And it'll pop off again. So here we are i was. So focused on making a video i forgot the most important part just about to turn the water on. And my brain went wait you haven't put the yeah look at this if i don't put this on first the whole valve assembly is going to come firing across the room wreck my silicone work wreck my day. Now here's a before you pull any tools out check the manufacturer's instructions these guys actually aren't a big fan of wrenches here even though it's set up for it they want you to go fingertight for a reason because they want to make sure that everything is lined up properly. And you can feel it okay if you start using a wrench. And it isn't lined up properly you may not even notice [music] it here we go quarter turn is plenty i happen to know from experience that that is going to work out great here we go oh before we put the handle on i got to put this on again we're doing this a little bit backwards. But this will still work okay there we go. Now the water's still off. So i can cheat get my set screw in there okay. And then don't forget the cap. So that when you turn the water on it doesn't get all wet. And it'll look pretty hot. And cold on off that's simple all right we have our face plate our handle. And our little set screw cover all in place. So we can leave that for. Now let's move on to the tub spo. Now the tub spo of course is a  let me just pull it out. And i'll show you this [applause] unit it should be a slip on yes. Now before i went. And did the plumbing for this bathroom i inquired with the company because it didn't have the finishing trim on hand. And they assured me that it was a slipon. And so that's why i ran a half copper. And put a test cap on it. And of course comes with its own allen key. And that's the set screw for this. So you have to back this one off you'll see it comes fully inserted that'll drive you crazy trying to push that on the line. So just back that off until it's out of the way. And now it's ready to install okay put the handle. And we're just going to take a little pipe cutter. Now the slip-on starts here. And there's lots of room in that pipe all the way in. So you can see we're good to go. So what i generally like to do is i like to cut it as far out as i can here around 3 in in case you ever want to change that to another system. And you need to have the ability to to solder on. And thread some of these fixtures that come they have a threaded pipe in here. So this way if i leave a little extra pipe. And i've got a solder on a connection. And do any other plumbing in another date the option's there for somebody if you cut too far back it just makes it really difficult to fix it later not every company does everything the same way. So it's nice to leave yourself options when you're working you'll be surprised when you're in this business how often you'll get a call from a client 5 10 or 15 years later. And they want to just make one little modification or a couple of changes or even 6 weeks down the road. Now this has got a little bit of water in it i drained the line. So it shouldn't be under pressure there we go of course remember we're going to be using our silicone when we're done the finishing trim. So as soon as you can get that water cleaned off the gro. So that it doesn't absorb too much the better you want to have that gro line as dry as possible when you go to silicone. So that you know it's going to stick before you put your fixture on grab your sand cloth. And just give the edge quick [music] buff okay if your edges aren't too sharp it's not going to wreck your little gasket in here. And it won't hurt your fingers either you just force that one on okay you want to just make sure that the name is up. And everything looks square reach underneath with the allen key find that little spot okay there we go remember these are all plastic parts in there. So don't overtighten just make it nice. And solid here we go what's that old song two out of three ain't bad. But we're not done yet this is the re pro two jet shower head they have a three jet shower head. And rain shower head options. And it's just manual control right here right you got to love it well that is some good looking shower head okay. So this particular shower head also comes with the arm. And there's a little flange here as well. And this nice it comes with a sticker to tell you which direction the water should be flowing which is kind of funny cuz traditionally the longer piece of pipe does go in the wall. And that's kind of normal. So just nice see i've been doing it right all these years okay. And so this is nothing simp it is nothing to this this flange is really basic. And it is just a compression fit okay you just want to wiggle it on. And there's little teeth on the back that have been kind of snapped out of the tin. And so you put that in there like that okay. And you're good to go. Now hopefully i don't get soak. And wet here either oh yeah here we go well if you haven't seen the project video. And if you haven't familiar with these i buy these at my specialty plumbing store. And this is the same size as this pipe. But it has a little gasket on it. So these are temporary that i put in there that's a shut off system it's also a identification system for installing wallboard. And tile it's exactly the same dimension as my pipe. And so when i install this i know exactly how to make my cuts. So these tiny little flanges that they come with when i go. And install that it covers that hole perfectly no guessing love that here is my system. Now for installing the shower arm in your wall okay you want to take your teflon tape. And you just roll it around three four five six 7 8 9 ridiculously 10 times around. And i'll tell you why i'm paranoid i'm doing a compression fitting inside a wall cavity. And after i turn the water on if it doesn't work it'll leak. And no one will know until it makes a big mess on the ceiling downstairs. And because i'm paranoid i to go a little overboard i also like to take a little bit of this thread sealer paste. And run it up onto the female fitting inside the wo. So now i've got two kinds of seal that are going on in here there we go okay. Now here's the secret go backwards a little bit until you feel it sit in the in the okay. Now this is going to be snug right out of the gate. So it's hard to tell the difference between cross threaded or just installed brass on brass. Now you want to fight with this until you get it in there perfect it's exactly nice. And tight like i like it however it's pointing up at the ceiling. So we have to fix that. So these shower arms are not made of metal that won't break. So you have to be gentle. And careful with this. But i like to get a little extra leverage on this instead of holding it here i like to hold it out here. So i'll put a screwdriver right in through the hole turn. And use my hand on the pipe okay. Now the shower head it has little flat pieces on the neck here that's for a wrench it's amazing how many people will call. And complain that there's a little drip of water coming out of here. And going right into to their tub oh my. But it happens. Now inside here there's a gasket okay. So that should work just compression f fingertight all right. So once you think you got it figuring tight reach in behind there find those little flat sections give it a couple more turns. And try to get it on there as tight as you [music] can. Now at this point this should be pretty much sitting on that gasket. And the way you make sure that this is done is you grab your wrench set it on the flat pieces okay. And you give it a couple of turns. But make sure you're only grabbing the flat pieces of that shower fixture all right. So now we got all of our fixtures installed it's time to clean up do all of our silicone. And then we can actually test all of this system water's automatically going to the tub perfect [music],https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=7175,"['What type of surface mounting plate comes with the Reel Pro system?', 'Why is a silicone bead not always necessary for subway tile installations?', 'How do you determine the correct screw depth when installing the Reel Pro system?', 'What is the purpose of the decorative chrome trim on the shower valve?', 'How do you properly install and secure the shower arm in the wall?']"

So we're pretty much at the last stage of our project. And this done the tub the shower the tile the fixtures we're all done. So now it is time to do the silicone this is the last step that we have to do to finish inside the tub surround. And there's a few tips. And tricks that i'm going to share with you. So follow me along as we go through this when i'm doing a tub shower i always want to have two types of silicone one is a clear. And the other one is my white or the color that matches my stone if i'm going with the natural brownstones of course i use the beige there are grays. And there if you go to a nice supply store you can get silicone in about 15 different colors okay. So don't be afraid to shop around. And make sure you're going to get the look you want when you're done. But because we have a glass mosaic i'm going to start with my clear silicone. And i'm going to do all the clear silicone areas at the same time. And then we'll switch it all over okay. So here we go first remove the tip. Now my cocking gun has a cutter on the side makes my life simple boom done all right. And then i also have this little wand that's attached to it it's a little filthy here. But and that is used because the tube itself is sealed. And i have to puncture the seal. So that i can have the silicone be released. And once i'm done it sits back on the handle put it in the cradle. And line it up. Now i cut it on a bit of an angle on purpose because i find it easier for installation one of the things you need when you're silicone is you want to have towels around okay you want to keep your hands clean. And keep your area clean as you go. And because we punctured it with a dirty stem i'm just going to start off by cleaning it out. And making sure what comes out of the tube is exactly perfect. Now because it's glass mosaic if i use white silicone here over top of my grout i'm going to get a really uneven nasty line on all my glass. So i'm just going to start right here. And i'm going to just run a nice little bead to there okay i'm going to put my dry finger on it. And as soon as i feel like i'm getting a lot in a buildup i'll pull it off all right done that's simple again in this corner just a little bit of pressure. And this particular gun when i let go the handle i have to put a thumb pressure here. And that releases the pressure inside the tube. So the cocking should stop coming out. And we'll just start with the dry finger the other place i need clear silicone is on my fixtures to my tile wall. Now depending on the stone that you use you may or may not need to do this. But because i did a subway tile i have a little bit too much texture on the wall. And too many gr lines interrupting my installation. So i want to make sure that the water that's running down this wall can't get in behind my wall. Now i don't need to go all the way around. But i want to just start at the top with a dry finger of course wipe that on my towel. And then come the other way there we go. Now next thing i want to do get a new towel i'm going to show you my little trick here wrap your finger in your towel. And set it on your plate you use your other finger against the plate pinch your finger. And then just run it around the plate okay what this does is it makes sure that it cleans the silicone off of the chrome nice. And tight to the wall. So it has a good looking finish. So we also want to do the same thing to our tub spout. And here we are again we don't need much there's not a gap here really. But i hear a lot of people get quite concerned about this scenario. And they're probably right to be i mean even though we have a waterproofing system there are holes in the wall. And this is the most common penetration point is around the fixtures just a little bit of pressure here you don't want to put. So much pressure you wipe it all off. And you at the same time you don't want to leave it on there either okay. Now we want to clean that similar system for wiping that off only this time while i'm holding the towel i pinch my finger. And i stick my other finger. And i use it like i'm scribing okay there we go. Now remember when you're buying your silicone at the store if you're going to the building store they have usually three kinds all right they've got   kitchen. And bath silicone. And then they have kitchen bath mold. And mildew resistant. And then they have kitchen bath mold. And mil de resistant. But it's really awesome. And it's going to last 20 years i have never seen a bathroom that had cocking that was 20 years old that didn't need to be replaced. So i don't spend the extra five bucks for something that tells me it's going to last that long i only get the 10 year. And the caps snap right back on again yeah no don't use your teeth it is only plastic though i mean really. Now now there's a lot of debate about siliconing a bathtub  i've seen people say you shouldn't grout the inside corners don't grout the tub to the tile wall shouldn't be grouting to the ceiling i like to do all the grip get it all sealed up because when i silicone i only do one application i don't want to have to put. So much silicone in there that it's just making a huge mess i don't want to have to tape the ceiling. And tape the walls. So if i gr first. Then i have a backing for the silicone to bind to. So what i do make sure you wear your shoes when you do this or you'll slip right off in your socks start from your inside corner with your tip angled like this. So when i'm applying my cocking i'm pushing it out in front of me. But i'm not scraping it off the back i'm going to just leave enough there that i'm filling the hole. And really this takes a little bit of practice have the right amount of pressure if you're not comfortable with this you can always tape it. And then you can wipe it. And then you can pull the tape off later. But this is the best way to do it right here okay again dry finger. And really i'm just connecting the ceiling to the wall here. And that's it i'm feeling there's too much okay. So i want to have my rag with me come back you have to leave. And come back again come back a couple of inches. And gently into the corner. And slowly apply your pressure again all right bam okay. So generally i'm working my top down okay i want to be able to clean as i go. And i start in the corner. And i pull. And i clean you can see the difference where the cocking isn't where the cocking is it's a very easy visual thing to manage let me get my tip proper here there we go you just run it along move the cocking gun just a little bit ahead of the cocking. And now you always wipe back towards where you were just like doing dryw mud on your ceiling joints. So what we're doing here. Now this side of the wall cuz the room wasn't level. And square i have a pretty significant grout gap. And when you only silicone the grout to the ceiling. But not the tile you'll really going to see it show it'll always scream at you. So i did the top joint. And now i'm filling in the bottom while the top is still wet blending them together here okay. So instead of my finger on an angle like that i'm going more straight along. Now and trying to fill this gap with the silicone right down to the tile okay. And i don't know about you. But i am pretty darn pleased with that okay the next is you're going to bring it down from the ceiling inside corner. And we're going to just fill that in concave you there's cut tiles. And different joints going on here. And remember we have clear here. So don't run into the clear what you want to do is use your thumb. And just push it back. And start right at the joint of the tile okay. So visually i want my silicone to start where my tile is okay. And even in the grove it's fine. But don't bring it down to the glass that'll just look really cheesy. And it'll scream. So now start up at the top with your finger press it in run that down dry done okay of course keep in mind always looking to see if the tile has been polished properly okay if there's any dust on there just take a second. And get rid of it you don't want to be attaching your cocking to dust or it'll just end up wiping s away all right. So we're done siliconing our walls. Now with the silicone the tub. But before we get down on our hands. And knees remember when we originally were working on this project. And if you haven't seen this you got to watch the other videos we were removing the wall without damaging the ceiling which is tough because it had drywall tape. Now we've installed our tile. And we've used the silicone on the ceiling that ceiling's already finished paint if you're in a situation where you have to paint your ceiling you only have two options you can wait to silicone until after you're done painting or if you're just trying to touch it up. And you have silicone in the ceiling you can actually when this is dry you can put painters tape over top of that to create an edge. And then you go to the store. And you buy a can of kills k i l lz it's in the paint department in an aerosol can. And you just couple of quick shots of kills on silicone. And you can paint latex paint over top of that. And you won't run into any problems okay. So the last thing we have to do is silicone around the tub to the tile to create that nice clean joint. Now remember it's not part of the waterproofing process. But it is part of what makes it look pretty. Now if you are not familiar with acrylic tubs. And you've only used steel. Then you can just go ahead. And do it with a steel tub you just do the seal. And walk away. But if you have an acrylic tub there is something you have to do before you silicone. And that is put weight in the tub okay. And the best way to do that just turn on the water. And let it get about halfway full. So now the reason we have to do this is because this is a very flexible material. And although it has supports. And all kinds of spraying underneath if i was to demonstrate any other technique for a large majority of tubs that are sold out there you're going to be very disappointed not every tub has as much support underneath it or as much reinforced spraying with the fiberglass underneath. So if you go to the hardware store. And you buy yourself a tub. And you get a great price on it it's probably because when you fill it full of water it's going to sink okay. And it's going to pull away from the wall a little bit. And so if you add the silicone when it's empty when it pulls away it'll break the joint on you. And then you'll get all the water. And the dirt in behind there. And even though it's waterproof it'll start to go ugly because it'll trap all the colors from the dyes. And the shampoos. And the dirt off you. And then before you know it a couple weeks goes by. And your silicone joint looks like garbage. And you got to do it all over again. And that's a lot more work than doing it right the first time. So same kind of process we're going to set our gun into the the corner. And we're not going to add too much like again i've already grouted that joint. And i've growed the joint because i use a tub that's reinforced. And it has feet. And i know it's not going to be moving around too much. So i'm not going to get that breaking out take my cloth set my finger in the corner i was fueling a lot of silicone there okay. So there was too much. So what i do is i push it against the back wall. And not on the bottom. And i just cleaned up the edge here we go. Now a lot of this is just experience. But a little bit of practice. And you can get really good at this i would suggest if you're going to do a renovation project like this before you tear it all apart cut out the existing silicone on your ugly tub. And tile. And then try sealing it again just. So you have a chance to get some experience with the product that way when you're ready to do your finishing work you already know how kind of pressure to use. And how comfortable you are with this kind of process. Now this is incredibly important here you get good pressure on this silicone cu this bond is part of your waterproofing system this is not just for being pretty most water that penetrates between the tub. And the tile is in this wall area right here. And there is no waterproof joint after the silicone between the wallboard. And the tub just nice light bead leave a little bit of a dollop at the top of course. Now the pressure i'm using here i want to actually feel the tub. And the tile with my finger on both sides. And then rock around the corner here there we go nice clean look okay we got one more rag going on i can't stress the importance of having clean towels around toilet paper also works. But these are nice. And durable okay. So now we're ready to do the last joint which of course is the tub to the tile make sure you vacuum clean make sure there's no dirt. And the same thing okay you want to just leave that bead really consistent here move at a nice consistent pace with consistent pressure. And you'll end up with a great result okay. Now this is part of the waterproofing system this silicone here is actually going to keep the water from getting between the tub. And the floor tile. So i'm actually trying to force it in the gaps out here that's why it takes a little bit more effort to get a good look cuz i'm actually forcing it in there pretty tight i'm getting it up the side of the wall of the tub. And all across the floor. So like i said it's a little different process proc say here okay this time i'm going to put all the pressure on my finger on the floor. And not on the tub just. So i can move that line back you can only do this with a dry finger if your finger's wet you're just going to smudge it around. And make a mess. So remember the last thing you got to do is take a look at your wall tile. And your floor tile. And think about the water that's going to potentially be coming over here especially if you got young ones having a tub in here seal this area as well just a tiny little bead. So it's almost insignificant okay. And there's two things you're doing here one you're getting rid of any little gaps. And cracks in your finish. So that it always looks pretty this is also cosmetic. But by filling this up with silicone you're also waterproofing this joint okay. So that's about everything you need to know to apply your silicone  again the steps are pretty basic  lots of pressure make sure you fill your gaps make sure the surfaces are nice. And clean. And then let let it dry don't be in a hurry most of these silicons you want 6 12 even 24 hours. So read the instructions on the can they'll all have that information there let all this sit with the water in the tub overnight for sure. And then maybe in the morning you can come by. And drain it. And wash it all up. And see if you've missed anything if you've missed anything you want to get this touch-ups done within 24 hours okay  if you let it to perfectly clear. And then you add silicone on silicone it doesn't bond very well. So the next morning is the time you want to have a look if you got any air bubbles go address them right away. And your bathroom will stay nice. And dry. So in this video i'm going to share,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=7996,"['What type of silicone do you use for tub and shower installation?', 'Why is it important to clean the area before applying silicone?', 'How do you apply silicone around a glass mosaic?', 'Can you grout inside corners when installing a bathtub?', ""What happens if you don't add weight to an acrylic tub before applying silicone?""]"

So in this video i'm going to share a construction cheat with you. So that if you end up chipping one of your existing tiles. And you don't have any more of those around there is a way to repair it it may not be perfect that all depends on how good an artist you are. So here's our chip the story is this we did a great job doing a demolition. And then the client ordered a tub that was bigger than the hole. So then we had to use grinder to cut back the tile line. And that went perfectly. And then maddie my son was cleaning up the subfloor. And of course his hammer hit the edge of the tile. And caused the chip. So not everything goes perfectly all the time. And i'm going to show you my little trick for fixing this up when you go to the hardware store you can actually buy porcelain glaze these little little bottles okay. And you go down to the tub section. And they usually have a little display com a little white box. And they have all the different manufacturers that they carry. And they have a porcelain glaze yay what they don't have is gray. So then you go to the paint department. And you buy a can of gray stain okay. And you get a couple of tools in a cardboard box. And you mix all these together. Now both of these are oil based. So i have gray tile i grabbed the gray stain if you have a different colored tile you can go to your michaels paint the apartment or something like that you know you can get some oil based paints in all your different colors. And you basically take your paint. And you mix it up with your glaze until you have something that looks a lot like your floor tile. Now that's probably just a little bit light still i'll add a little bit more of my stain there we go. Now generally you're going to want to do this in about two applications come over here. And a little dabble dow. And you want to just use your little tool fill it right up to the edge where that chipped off the glaze. So you're getting the color of the stone. And the glaze okay there you go. Now if there's too much of it just take your flat tool pull up back okay the only thing left while it's still nice. And wet is take a little bit of a paper towel. And just buff in the area around the stone that's not included with the chip okay voila. Now it's not perfect. But it is lot better than that chip that was there 2 minutes ago. Now the little little bit of glaze kit here it comes with this little handy dandy piece of sandpaper. And what you do is you give this about an hour let it dry come back. And you can sand it down nice. And smooth. And if you like you can mix a couple more colors at this point put in a little bit of little bit of a darker color. And you can mix up a little bit you can even get an artist brush okay. And you can just dab in a little bit of that two-tone texture on there. And you can spend as much time. And energy as you like as many coats as you like just make the su sand between coats. And when you finally get the one you're looking for just walk away. Now you're sealed up. And that floor is waterproof,https://youtu.be/NS6TPiHaN2Y?t=8997,"['What type of tile was damaged in the video?', 'Where can you buy porcelain glaze?', 'How do you mix oil-based paint with porcelain glaze?', 'What is the purpose of using a flat tool and paper towel after applying glaze?', 'Can you achieve a perfect match with the original tile color by mixing multiple coats?']"

Now you're sealed up. And that floor is waterproof again. So most people they have a damaged piece of wallboard whether it's a renovation like we were doing here behind us where we have a bit of a seam issue or they've got a door knob dent in the wall or they're just going to repaint a room. And they've got little pin holes where they had pictures. And screws. And plugs. And so i'm going to share with my a secret today for how to fill all those things. And the reason this is such a huge secret is because it fills it super fast you don't have to sand it. And you don't have to prime it. And you don't even need to use two coats of paint to finish it all right this is my secret in the trades for whenever i've got to do a touchup. And i'm ready to head out of a project. And i see something i don't like i can take five minutes. And fix that before i walk out the door. And it doesn't need any work after i'm done. And here's the trick you got to own a hawk on a 4in knife all right. So go to your store. And make sure you buy them. So what you want to do is you want to grab some sheetrock 45 all right. Now this is a quick drying drywall compound it comes in powder form. And you've got to mix this yourself all right. And you take your hawk. And you set it over your sink. And you just want to make a little bit of a volcano here okay. And this is easier to do with a lot of it harder to do with a little. But you really want to set up a little bit of a volcano okay there we go. Now before i get started the secret here is hot running water make sure you get the water running first. And once it's hot bring it into your volcano. Now this is going to take a little bit of practice to get used to how much water to put in there. Now you want to hold it. And you've got a couple options you can leave it on there for about a half an hour or. So but it'll harden faster than you can mix it where you just take your knife. And off the edge lift up some of the loose powder. And shake it in there like you're icing a cake okay work your way around the volcano ice your cake. And if a little bit starts to come out don't worry about it there's not enough water there to cause a problem. And once you've gone all the way around the edges it should start to become more of a paste okay. And then you can just break it up. And you mix it in right here on the hub okay no mixing tools no pales no mus no fuss right here on your hawk use your 4-in knife. And just work this in. Now it's more of a paste. Now you just want to flatten it out. Now make sure all your bumps are out of there okay the smoother this is when you put it on the wall the easier it will be to finish. And you just check right there like that yeah i'm loving it. So now i've got a drywall compound that's got a hardening agent in here that's chemically activated. And anybody who knows any science knows when you add heat to any kind of chemical reaction it speeds up the reaction. And that is why we are using hot water on this. So generally 40 5 minute mud with regular cold water takes 45 minutes to an hour to set up. But if you add hot water you can be sanding this in 20 minutes if you out of really hot water or if you live out in the country. And you got lots of minerals be careful cuz this can set up in 5 to 10 minutes okay. And so. Then what we're going to do is we'll just show you we'll apply some of this mud here. And so this is my finished coat all right nice. And tight. And i'm really pressing this on here. And the goal is to fill every little scratch every bump okay. So that this wall is nice. And smooth this particular wall had to be resurfaced with a new corner cuz we changed the tub. And i just started working on this this morning this is. Now the third coat of mud i'm putting on here okay there we go. Now that is going to be beautiful you know we try on this channel to show people all the tips. And tricks for doing the work themselves. And remember even the most complicated project still needs to have simplified finishing all right. So here we go just going to double check make sure everything here is good got any bumps any bubbles this one was done earlier had a lot of people comment on the on the channel  you know can you do wet sanding is there any way to keep dust down what i'm just doing a small space i don't want to make a mess this is the system for you. So you just take your sponge you get these at the building store in the tile department this is for actually doing gro. And i'll just demonstrate here real quick this is mud that's just been pressed on it's got the wrinkles it needs to be feathered out okay. And you just give it a wipe there you go let it dry you're ready to paint i know it's that simple once again you know just go around your fixtures take the excess off if you see any ridges just wipe them out there you go ready to paint. And the best thing about this 45-minute mud is even after you get it wet because it has a hardener it'll dry in just a couple minutes. So if you want to get a job done in the same day you can take a whole room do all your patching. And then you don't have any priming to do or if you've already finished your project. And you bump a wall with your ladder on the way out you can do your 45 minutes mud put it on there real quick give it a few minutes even take a hair dryer to help dry it off damp sponge okay come back with some paint get a little mini roller. And you can touch up your paint job. And walk out the door within the hour. And that is money in the bank thanks for joining us on this edition of how to renovate your tub. And tub surround from a to z we've covered a lot of information in this series. But we also have these broken down into individual videos on our channel in the event that you're doing maintenance or just tackling one small aspect of this  we also have a lot of other a toz videos.

And throw it away important to measure make sure that one you're putting in will fit the hole there we go 29 3/4 says 30 inch on the box my hole is 29 3/4 i know from a lot of experience that these are a standard size. And if you have an old 30-inch stove underneath a 30-inch hood fan the new one will fit just behind. But this is an old house. And it never hurts to have a process that you can count on you know we've obviously gotten screws in here let's particulars. And we don't have access to the screws directly we have a little separation shield there we're just going to remove okay here we are. Now that's not that other way. Now we've exposed our screws. And there's a ton of them hold count. So usually the hopefully as they're just installed with these four locations here you put the screws in first you leave them back though to pop the hood fan is. Then you take the screws later we've got screws on the wall screws on the cabinets skirted we're not necessarily wow i've never seen a hood fan screwed. So much. So this is the part i was looking forward to what kind of electrics do we have here oh. So we have a blue 3 wire coming to the hose fan. And the red line is cut i have no idea where it's coming from. But it's still a 14 gauge just absolutely amazing nothing. But i gotta love the duct tape this is my favorite okay. So this is live power. So because there are electrical issues here this is obviously done by the homeowner at some point not a licensed electrician they don't even have this wire attached to the hood fan with the grommet. So what we're going to do is we're going to remove this hood fan i'm going to get this back installed again. And then i'm going to call in the electrician. And have them take a look at the connection in the breaker panel. And then connect the hood fan at the same time all right here we go. Now it's that simple there is a damper on the back of these there's our wire it's actually in pretty good shape right there. So when you're dealing with something like this in your own home as a homeowner in ontario you have to check your own municipality or county about this. But you are allowed to handle your electricity in your own home whether or not that's a good idea you know it'll depends on you. But in this case because we couldn't even short the breaker out identify it i have a lot of serious questions about how this is wired. So we're calling an electrician in because a this isn't my house. And b we're not exactly sure what's going on. So we're not even going to try to hook this back up again always best to get a lesson licensed electrician in. And here's another tip for you if you need an electrician to come into your house if we install the hood fan. And leave the wires in they're ready to roll. And he's here for a small amount of time if you ask him to install the hood fan for you he may or may not know how. And he might end up leaving again before he even starts. So it's best to have the appliance installed ready to go. And then call for rewiring here we go hood fan today packaging packaging packaging remove the screen what we're looking for here is the brand new adapter for the back to match up the existing access. And here it is this particular unit as well most nowadays comes up options for a rear vent or top vent rear vent means out through the wall. And here's our thing there cute we'll see what those are for in minutes this is our electrics open up the housing here. And we have options for rear let's set this aside.

And it turns out it's something as simple as someone didn't take the tape off we're upside down right. Now so it'll stay open when we invert it it'll stay closed. Now the screws for mounting this are always found somewhere on this unit. And this one comes with the top mounting plate which we don't need. So this will be discarded. But we'll save the screws these are just machine screws you can actually that one started need to slide that right in a lot of little pieces to be holding with one hand a little trick there all right. Now we're ready to mount it. So the mounting process is simple what we need to do is measure to where these screws here are going to go you can see these four locations where the screws go designed on purpose where you put the screw into the cabinet first leave them hanging. So you can put this in. And then slide it to the back we're just going to mark our location 308. And 11 inch three. And 11 inch this hood pan is six inches deep the old one was only four. And a quarter. So this hood fan is actually going to sit over top of the time. So we get a count for that depth. And we're going to add an extra quarter inch each of these markings we're going to leave these hanging up really good healthy amount here's the trick the idea here is to get it in position. And you're marking more focus about the exhaust when i get that exhaust damper first i want to get the exhaust. And first pull on the wire until we get that grommet cheaply you can see my screws are in a decent position probably didn't pull them forward enough we're going to set two little to hold the weight of this unit. And then we're going to readjust our screws right up to the front there we go. So in the package that came with the hood pan is this cute little suction cup thing. And this tool is designed for your halogen light installation. And it's a little suction cup. And you put it on your halogen light bulb. And you use it to screw it in the reason you have to use this is because human hands secrete oil. And if it gets on the bulb the bubble overheat. And it will blow up. And stop working. So whenever you're changing halogen bulb wear gloves do anything you can separate yourself from the bulb in the last room that's all i can do we got to call the electrician to get this sorted out. But basically all you have to do is pop your lights in these are oh they're mr2 those are the little a little halogen lights with the two pins you got to put them in. And give them a quarter turn that's why this. So then you would put your light bulb on here give the twist. And you're done. So what i'll call the electrician i'll have them bring me a couple of bowls while he's at it. And then you can get the self powered up [music],https://youtu.be/l6jhNtUxdp0?t=390,"['What is the purpose of removing the tape from the damper in a hood fan?', 'Why do homeowners need good airflow in their hood fans?', 'How does the mounting process for the new hood pan work?', 'What is the function of the suction cup tool provided with the halogen light installation?', 'Why is it recommended to wear gloves when changing halogen bulbs?']"

And i'm gonna drill a hole near the top of the cabinet at the back. And i'm gonna drill one near the bottom at the back to take care of that. So that when i it's time for me to install my dishwasher i'm not gonna be fussing around on my back upside down drilling holes [music]. So our sink. And our faucet are supplied by stylish this is a company i met at a toronto home show two years ago it's kind of brilliant they're a canadian company that got into the designer sink. And faucet market. But they're bringing a really high quality product at a much more affordable price. So most homeowners can afford to go delve into that lap of luxury as far as quality is concerned without buying plastic. And really cheap stainless steel. So there gonna be a link to the amazon page where you can actually take a look at these products. But i've absolutely just loved the quality this is pasta here right. Now has got to be humbles 12 pounds me really we're gonna stick that one in first that's kind of a big hole here we go. So we're gonna stick all over water spine lines. And our adjustable hose line through the standard one. And a quarter inch hole that gets drilled by the courts guy get rid of that we don't need the snow right okay comes with weight in this middle clip. Now this bracket goes over all the hoses collectively if you organize them properly they'll all fit nice. And comfortable nothing will get bound. And then all you do is drive these screws into this metal plate underneath the sink it gives you really good tension to hold this in steady for years. And years to come oh yeah without a sink here this is actually really easy operation. So let's get everything nicely organized because the quick connect end here they have to go over top of this first. And then feed the water supply line through you're going to put it up on a cold there put a hot there go like that okay. And then the one that's moving around will go right through them huh i'm gonna start the thread off nice. And simple i want to access to all these screws. So we careful where i finish off two screws on the back that's actually a good spot no it's important all of this is flexible right we want to square this off really nicely. And then drive these screws home great the compression don't over tighten it you'll just strip the screw. And then you won't be able to make adjustments if you ever need to in the future there we go oh love it all right what a great spot for video image okay. Now the weight is what gets wrapped around the host. So that creates tension to lift up on this. And that way you can pull down on the way. And it'll pull it up into the end of seat really nice here we just have to take the just engage the screw on boys okay here we go install it on this big freakin hose over here. So this connects quick connect right in there done locked. And push them pinch the two you can release it. But that's locked in place. So now it is hanging. And they got some tension on that rod. So i want to have this weight right at the bottom okay. So i'm gonna pinched. And now i'm going to screw back together most faucets i have a pull-out drain operate with a similar system this is not new technology it's just really really convenient ok. So here we are there's my hot my cold lines. And after we'll be able to connect that to our shutoff valves right here piece of cake yeah oh this is done. So now we have nothing left to connect ready to put the sink in. Now first shane what's product placement this is the stylish sink. Now i contact these guys because i saw them at the home show. So i reached out to them. And i said hey would you be interested in supplying the sink whether i get your innovation. And then i'm gonna do a review on the product. So it's not an unboxing obviously i've already ripped the box apart. But first thing i'm noticing is right out of the gate the features. And benefits of this sink are absolutely phenomenal. So we had a little difficulty getting the quartz cut to fit the template because it's such a unique style the guys at the quartz store didn't bother reading the template instructions. So if you end up buying this make sure you beat them over the head with the template instructions. So they actually follow it because it has to be very precise you can see that this is the undermount. But this track here is for all of the features. And benefits to operate. So it had to be exact. And it couldn't be too small which is what happened does frustrating. But anyway it comes with a bamboo cutting board. And this is brilliant it actually has the drain groove that runs right off back into the sink genius right in those little details 16 gauge sink stainless steel silicone wrapped. And drying rack goes across the top as well colander hmm check this out okay full stainless steel oh that's cool it's got the food trap in the basket strainer that hangs underneath that is a cool feature i'm telling you the world is changing companies that don't adapt soon we're gonna get left behind because companies like this are coming on the market. And they're know these products. And bringing them to market for half the traditional cost for these kind of designers inks unbelievable of course if you wanted to buy one there's a link in the amazon store there we go right that goes in the bottom to protect the bottom of the sink from scratches brilliant what we're doing right. Now is we're gonna install this okay me. And my son are gonna install this it's actually quite heavy it's a pretty good sized thing. And we're not gonna just sell a cone it okay we can't get away with that kind of weight with that capacity of water to just silicone it to the countertop. But we're gonna start by silicon again to the set countertop i'm going to show you a different trick than i've shown in other sink videos. So that you can install this at home. And you don't have to pay the premium price at the quartz counter shop to get this done you can buy your course. And haven't delivered on site. And then you can finish all the installation yourself. And save a ton of money. So let's get into this i'm gonna set this aside. And wait for him to come back just go in to the store for a few minutes to grab me something that i forgot. So a secret here is it take a two-by-four. And i cut the bottom piece,https://youtu.be/WvtoWJdvP3I?t=67,"['What type of material are the sink and faucet made of?', 'How does the adjustable hose line work?', 'Why did you choose to use a quarter inch hole for the water supply line?', 'Can you explain how the compression works in the sink installation?', 'What is the purpose of the bamboo cutting board that comes with the sink?']"

And i cut the bottom piece just a little bit smaller than the sink. And i set it underneath the sink. And i marked two locations in the middle of the drain. So that i can do this i can take half inch threaded rod okay put it through the hole all right washer. And a nut. And i can use this underneath the sink to lift it in place while i have compression from on top see this drilled the hole may be too exact it'll get there in a second there we go washer. And nut okay. And so i can build this assembly with the sink underneath in the cavity put all this together. Then i can lift the bottom into place. And then do the using compression to pull it all together nice. And tight it's a good little system. And it'll make sure that my bond is perfect to the underside of the counter. And it gives me the ability to have all that weight carrying. And transferred to the gable ends of the counter. So that i can locate it in the perfect position before i use the wrench to tighten it into position once it's all dried i'm going to put in supports for the weight underneath i'll show you that a little later. But here we go matthew's back let's pull this apart. And get this installed okay. So i've got my nuts. And my washers ready we're short two by four with my holes drilled already i got my sink i got my rod bracket i got my math you all right here we go gonna reach in grab that seat no i'm just gonna go connect not. So much yours underneath here hey how you doing that i'm good okay no real quick suggesting new flexed silicone okay i've been using this stuff for the last six or seven years never had a countertop fail on me. Now in conjunction with the silicone i'm gonna put a support rod in there we're gonna add that in the little later in the video. So no new flex is not sponsoring austin or anything is just when you know something that you love you share it with the world. So here we go. Now i'm ready to go i've got my weight being held by my rod on my 2x4 the sink is just kind of swinging around it's cantilevered because the drains are to the back okay. So my front is wide open what i'm gonna do is run a bead of,https://youtu.be/WvtoWJdvP3I?t=542,"['What type of material was used for the support rod?', 'Why was the bottom piece of the 2x4 cut smaller than the sink?', 'What is the purpose of using compression in this system?', 'How does the weight being held by the rod affect the installation?', 'What type of sealant was recommended to be used with the silicone?']"

Then i'm gonna lift it into place clamp it. And then i'm gonna run the bead around the rest of that. And then tighten up all the nut. And thread assembly until everything's under compression. And in place waiting to be cured no note make sure your countertop is at room temperature before you do this the quartz company that brought this in actually set it in place. And was about to silicone everything. But it was. So cold that day i told them i said just don't touch anything with your silicone because it's not gonna bond what's the point of doing it. Now if you're gonna do something you know you got to make sure it works. And i don't want to say do it right that would just be wrong. So here we go nice. And simple. Now my overhang is about one inch okay i'm actually using this tip nozzle to push the silicone towards the backside of that one-inch when it's all said. And done i'll be able to do a decorative bead all around the joint. But i don't want to have it all squeezing all over the place. And making a mess. So i'm going to start out here it takes a little bit of patience. And precision this is an adhesive application. So less is more just doing a huge amount of silicone is just gonna make a bigger bigger mess here we go like that this little piece of wood here when they situation is just nice to have an extra pair of hands okay well everything is nice. And wet take a drive finger just wipe away any excess. Now i'm just gonna simply comb the rest of that sink alright i'm gonna lift it up. Now get this in position here right before we compress everything within the nuts just want to look for a little extra. But it's a silicone get rid of okay knees up not a everything under compression all the way around. So there we go that is the rough-in for the sink. Now we are going to be back here again in about 48 hours to do the finishing off. Now i know a lot of guys in the business they'll do something like this at the end of the day the next morning they're right in there doing the plumbing. And that's a secret to why. So many of these sinks fail because we're dealing with stone. And stainless steel. And those materials don't stay very warm okay. So give it a 24 hours to 48 hours depending on the temperature conditions let that silicone finish its curium bonding process. And before you take off your rods. And assembly you're gonna want to follow the next step. But we'll show you that after the end. And we're back here we are it's been a couple of days actually since we put the sink in unfortunately max has had himself a little accident. And he's unable to come. And film for us. So we have our friend chris thanks chris for coming out today chris is gonna take care of the rest of the filming for today.

So assembling the sink trainer is a little bit complicated to do on camera. So i'm going to show you up here first that is we dropped this piece in. And has the foam gasket that seals up against the sink. And then we have this can here that goes underneath with this rubber gasket. And that's designed to have perfect compression with the sink itself. And we have this locking nut here which will be what gives us that compression okay that'll tighten that assembly together. And then we have another ring with another washer. And the tailpiece which has got a flirt end. So you put the rubber gasket inside of here. And then we'll throw that on wow. And that'll be how the whole thing is assembled underneath. Now i gotta get underneath the sink. And put all this together okay here we go don't forget this locking ring on will be alright come on baby secret here's to go backwards until you feel it there it catch. And this is just a little bit of an ocd moment here. But i'll show you this inside the drain it has the stylish name on it. So i am trying to position that at the 12 o'clock position inside the sink tell me crazy. But i know. Then if it's not in the right spot it's gonna look real funny forever. And ever. And ever [music] okay you know the secret to doing plumbing on your own is making sure that everywhere there's a connection you have a seal whether it's a gasket or a pipe thread or putty or tape everything needs a seal don't ever just rely on metal the metal okay in this fitting here these are awesome be careful when you go to the store because they also make the same fitting with a smaller hole that's for bathroom sinks kitchen sinks this is inch. And a half make sure you get the right size all right whoo all right. So all we got to do.

So all we got to do. Now is connect our p-trap with their joints love my rigid pipe cutting tool has little tooth on it here. And we just want to make enough type to go inside the fitting to connect everything together. So we just need about an inch in a bit easier than that we would still want to have a bit of a slope here. So i cut two pieces i took the short one i'll put on this side the long one on this side that just makes my life easier okay a little hint for you when you're working with your adhesive a nice thick shop towel in case you drip [music] all right.

Now so i'm going to finish this part of the installation along with the sink if you're watching the install a dishwasher video you're gonna see this twice it's important to show. So we're gonna need a ring clamp. And we put that hose over here. And one of the things we want to do when we're working like this is work from the back to the front of the sink alright.

And then i'm attached to the pipe first gonna take my decorative cap ring just a little bit of a pinch i'll keep it from sliding around all right well that's the cold water. Now you'll notice that in this situation actually i'm bringing the hot water on the opposite side of a traditional. But my dishwasher is coming from this side. So that's why we're doing that while i'm for the dishwasher is the same three hose. So that is nice. And simple there we go always when you're putting on a line that has a gasket give it a couple of turns on the wrench after you go finger tight because here there's just a lot of room left in that gasket okay. Now these are quarter turns. And when the handle is across the pipe that's off. And when it's in line with the pipe it's on. So we're gonna leave everything off for. Now just for the purpose of doing a water test. Now you can see assembling plumbing what these crimpers is really quite easy. And you can always rotate your hoses. And your vows after the fact there we go. So we'll connect this supply line. Now okay. So now you can see we have our pullout faucet on our weighted line hot. And cold supply line teed off for the dishwasher a connection for our drain make sure that the connection is pointing in the direction of the water's going to be flowing. And now we have to do is just assemble at all of course we're gonna want a p-trap when you're under a sink like this you want a p-trap that gives you an access here okay this is in case of the wedding ring folks hopefully your wedding ring is real. And it'll be heavy enough that i'll sit in the bottom of that p-trap if it doesn't you know apply the teflon in the same,https://youtu.be/WvtoWJdvP3I?t=1394,"['What type of crimpers are used for assembling plumbing?', 'Why is a p-trap necessary under a sink?', 'How do quarter turns work on a wrench?', 'What happens when a hose is finger-tightened?', 'What should be applied to prevent Teflon from sticking to metal?']"

So you look at teflon because it allows you to tighten this water tight with your fingers you don't need to use any any tools we're gonna leave that a little loose for. Now because we want to get this right. And exactly the right location okay. So first thing here get this fitting here ready to go. Now the connections process is simple we need to go from here to here with this interrupting on the way. And then there's the peach up over here. And then connect to the down drain this is just sitting in here right. Now and i'll make that the right height as i go i'm leaving myself lots of room okay there we go i'm on a nice distance between here. And here of at least two inches. So there's room for adding this fitting to take the water back down okay here we go can you work pretty quick with this stuff just remember i always saw both sides the pipe end the fitting you want to measure from this point here the edge to the edge all right. So we're not doing a seven inch piece we're actually cutting it at eight-and-a-half is right you do this whole pipe all at once you just close it together nice. Now loosen up these. And lift all of this up as far as it goes well that one is already okay. And a quarter turn okay. So here we go the bubble is just a little bit to the left. Now that's level pushing down until the bubble is on the other side of my little line here that's how i know i got the right slope okay you tighten that you position plus a quarter all right no we got to do just get this over to here yeah. So i'm gonna hold this fitting in position. And then mark the bottom of this pipe well that line there represents the bottom of the fitting. So i'm actually gonna cut it up here because the pipe goes inside the fitting the depth of that really the pipe. And then we just need to measure the right depth here. And the same thing as before. So then we'll tighten this up there we go. Now the only thing that's left for me to do here. Now is to connect the pipe to my my main straighter pump in the basement. And then we turn the water back on. And give this a test all right. So the last couple connections are gonna be right down here in the basement just got to take that pipe that came through the ceiling run over to my macerator. And the installation this is awesome for flexibility i used it to run my other bathroom. And i'm gonna use it. Now and. Then later on in the next video series at this house we're gonna be putting in an ice bar in the front room as well. And i'll take all that plumbing down here as well. So flexible. So what we're gonna do we're just gonna expose the cap i had that done the last video if you want to know how to install this bad boy i'll put a card up in the description here you know is take a look at that. But basically this is plug. And play it's just some gear clamps rubber gaskets ties everything together. And it has two motors that work independently. So they actually take turns operating one than the other it has an alarm system on it if anything fails it's just brilliant it's total diy plumbing there we go. Now i'm connected to my sewer system what this does is has the ability to pump sewage after it's been blended up. And mesa rated up 30 feet no 100 it's no matter where you are in your building this will get the sewage over to your septic tank. And it'll extend the life your tank as well because it comes pre whipped up beautiful the only thing. Now to do couple mark lube fittings. And then we're going to turn the water back on. And try this thing out okay really all right all right. So i've got the waterlines charged i got the drain all hooked up to the mace raider just gonna go through the last few details about this sink. And listen if you're interested in taking a look at the stylish products the faucet. And the sink will have descriptions in the link below. And you can go check them out you can get some of these products from amazon as well. So we have sink protectors they go in the bottom wow. And they've got rubber feet. And extra corners. And the cool thing is that came a little bag with extra hardware. So if you lose any overtime good to have that hanging around in the back way that we got the basket strainer. So these are awesome because they're really recessed. And they hold lots of food. And then they got the caps that's beautiful other features of this we have a stainless steel drying rail system here. So you can put things on there it's coated in silicone. And this entire sink is designed to function correct the even the cutting board has groove lines in it to drain back into the sink that's awesome you also have the colander. So if you're having a party you can fill that up full of ice i'm just loving my new sink. But pretty is one thing. Now we're gonna find out if it actually works okay open the shut-off valves. So when you're testing your sink the seam is functioning there's a couple of different pieces of the process you want to go through one is you want to turn it on. And try each strain okay give it about 30 seconds okay let it run for a little while. Then try the other one. And make sure that every one of these fittings is tested with the sink filled up with water. And then a quick release on the drain you'll give the ultimate test. So just check the drain real quick right out of the gate. And see if it leaks. And then if you're happy with everything they need to test it by filling your sink because if you can fill the sink. And it doesn't leak. Then you know you're in good shape i'm kind of funny you gotta get the air out of the system here first. So far. So good. So what i'll do is i'll actually take a blue towel. And put it underneath each of these drains. And check for any drips. But right. Now i've not seen anything check this side. So that's the information how to install.

And he wanted to know about cold air return in his basement did they need one or two or ten he didn't have a clue. So he just called checked in with us to see what the deal was with that. And he's a member. So he got to contact us during the live show happy to help joe out. And we'll come back. And we'll explain a little bit more about that answer.

So there isn't some unsightly bulk out is it acceptable to have two returns in the basement how large should they be  i would say one return for every 1500 square feet is fine as long as it's a six inch pipe. But if you want two go ahead here's the deal think of your basement like a balloon. And if you're going to blow hot air into that balloon the easiest way to do that is if the other side of the balloon has a release valve. So the extra air the the stale air. And the balloon can blow out while you're blowing in the fresh warm stuff that's what a cold air return is it's passive. So when you're pushing air in it can be exhaled out the other side okay. So generally a six inch pipe is more than enough to take care of about a 1500 square foot basement having two just makes the system easier to function. And it's not going to hurt anything by any stretch. And if you want to bring heat to the floor sometimes the best way is build a mechanical wall right where your furnace area is or or coming underneath the stairs. And you do all the duct work behind those walls where it's kind of an unfinished space that's a great way to do it if you can't do that. And you don't want to have an unsightly bulkhead the other option is to run an electrical line you can get a small electric heater that goes on the wall that has a blower fan on it. And you can position that in the basement right where you're going to be sitting. And that can deliver a nice path of warm air where you're going to be sitting. So that you don't have a comfort problem when you're using your basement. So cheers to that.

But we're just going to help out a little bit more information here. So here's a house it's a one story with a basement okay. And here's your furnace. And it's forced air. And so the air is coming from here in a lot of older houses you'll see these long rectangular grates in in the wall okay. And they're connected to ducting. And it comes down. And it goes through a filter. And then it goes through the heating element. And then it's blown up through the fan through all the duct thing on the floor usually by all the doors. And windows that are in the house. And that's how we operate basic concepts when you're heating a basement the trick with this is the heat comes out. And they put in a heat register in the ceiling. And the heat kind of blows down like this right -huh. And it starts to rise again. So he was joe was finishing his basement you want to know how do i solve this problem. And the secret is you have to take part of this side take off the cold air return. And bring that pipe right to the floor six inch pipe okay put a grill on it. And so what happens is you see it's like a circulation okay air is being pulled in through the cold air pulled in through the cold air follows the duct. And then it's blowing hot. And as soon as you add cold air to the floor. And so there's hot air going down starting to rise again it goes down. And it starts to be drawn towards that hot that cold air intake. So the heat is being drawn towards it. So now you're you're pulling you're pulling air in. And you're pushing air out okay that creates a system where the air is always moving. And it provides heat to the whole basement if you only have one in a basement on a six inch pipe generally you're great for 1500 square feet if you have a massive basement don't be afraid to put a second one in maybe somewhere off of here bring it in on another wall down to the other end okay. So you can bring the heat. And circulate it through the room that's really the whole system.

Now to get back to finishing this this kind of thing is really simple in this situation this is actually my straight board.

Now that my nails my screws caught it watch this pull nice. And flush. And i can control where it finishes off until it is absolutely perfect. And then. Now i've got the depth set i drive another one straight through. And that'll keep it from moving on this side something similar only this one we want to drive forward.

So we are in our latest bathroom renovation project. And the one thing we say to the end is the bathroom fan. And the reason we saved it is because there is a product finally that you can install from inside the space. And you don't have to go into the attic usually unfortunately the client here told me about something new a new problem that he was having with this fan. And it explains we can take a look at the condition of this it's just covered in dirt. And usually that's a telltale sign that there's a lot of moisture hanging around the fan. So what he told me is that sometimes when they sitting in his toilet it rains on his head i'm like oh boy i know exactly what's wrong with your bathroom i said you've got one of those exhaust vents out the roof. And he's like yep i do it's just. So listen folks if you've got one of those vents out the roof. And you got moisture coming into your bathroom we're gonna show you how to solve that problem as well. And then we're going to install this fan from inside like as if everything else was right. But you got two problems here one you got an old outdated fan that's not strong enough for the space. And its really really noisy. And second the ducting is done wrong. So we're gonna solve those problems in this video today. But before we go upstairs to deal with the ducting issue we're gonna disconnect the power here you know. And you know this was a do-it-yourself look at this wire isn't connected to the box we've got painters tape on the joints. And there's just nothing about this that's right i've gotten no hope at all that i'm gonna find anything upstairs it looks like it's supposed to be there. So before we can go. And change this fan out we've got to get into the attic. And change the ducting. So like every house is gonna have access through the attic there one of these old manholes whoa not a lot of space well listen it's really simple process we've got some insulated duct line here with a moisture barrier on it i've got a gear clamp some tuc tape my drill a couple of hand tools in case it's a mess up there all right max is gonna follow me right into the hole here. And we'll see what we got i see she's a warm one up here max huh this is usually not where you we see in an attic here in this region this insulation is really below standard looks like an r 12 it's it's only a 2x4 framing it's unbelievable these folks definitely got to get something up here. Now we got no air vent right where i want to put my. So the fans should be under heat yes wow here we go we'll just peel off a little bit of skinny little pink stuff. And lay it on top of the fan. So the inspector can't see that we gave the fan. And insulation rating of about 0.5 my god let's take a look at this we got a wrapped up piece of insulation held on with baler wire oh my god yeah. And that's what happens condensation oh look at that it's not even connected it's just placed in the same region as the fan oh for pete's sake well that explains well explains everything around here wow deadly brutal in a long time because it's not okay wow hi-yah all right. Now we're gonna get rid of this duct tape cuz that's just not gonna do us any favors i've got to get some rigid pipe into this hole attached to the roof sheathing somehow yeah wow that's gonna be interesting i think maybe my best bet try to salvage this elbow yeah that's gonna be all oh look at that still moves there we go come on baby hey here we go we're gonna make ourselves our own flange here we're gonna just cut down around this pipe peel back by the tabs screw them in i don't that much of a choice here yeah come sir which is french for like this. Now the the duct outside has kind of got a bit of a gooseneck to it kind of looks like a hummer air vent. And you can see them from the road. But there are about 10 inches by 10 inches. So when i screw through this plywood i'm not actually screwing through the roof membrane of the waterproofing system i'm screwing through the plywood that's inside the diameter of that fence. And so this is gonna work out just fine okay too old for this all right here we go no originally i figured i was coming up here because they had a direct vent straight up right. And the reason that that causes problems is that if rain is being driven by the wind. And it gets into this pipe. And this direct vent. Then there's nothing to keep it from just continuing down. And running right out of the ceiling fan. So what you want to have is a duct line that does this okay you want to want a bit of a curve you want to bump if the water comes down in the rain it'll settle in this kind of like a pea trap. And you're not gonna get a lot of water we're talking about a few drips every once in a while. And then when you use the fan on a daily basis that'll dry that out. And so your system works fine. So that's what i figured i was doing here didn't realize i was gonna be didn't leave the mother of all evil bathroom fan installations dear lord all right what you want to do let's get your gear clamp a couple of rings the metal rings down. And then slide this over the 4-inch okay. And just watch your head when you're working in here all the roofing nails are sticking through the plywood above you you bump your head here that'll make you bleed we're gonna just tighten that gear clip on. So it's not moving. And then for a good measure we're gonna lift up the insulation nice. And tight to the roofing here. And we're gonna try to get this on. And that's about all we have to do up here the rest we can do from the bathroom we can bring the ducting down we can fix this the right length we can run the wire down. And we can work the rest of this from downstairs. Now had this been installed properly it would have already been a flexible line you'll be able to avoid this step altogether. And just do from the bathroom. So now we're gonna pick up with this video from where we left off or the idea of just installing a new family put the fan. And let's talk about the product right. Now this is not a sponsored video they don't know i'm doing this. But i love this fan because i've used it before. And i know about the flexibility when you're going in the store this is sold at home depot just. So you know half the store they have more than one version of this. So make sure you get the right one for your room there has a rating here for the cfm that's cubic feet per minute 110 is usually the perfect size for a 3-piece bath. Now if you have a large space you might need to go to 140. But generally 110 is fine. And it has one sewn. And that's the sound rating. Now there are fans that are a little quieter than one. But it's kind of that whole scale of how much do you want to spend to get just a little bit quieter because this is gonna be really pretty quiet. And honestly for a hundred. And forty bucks for this thing this is a great value because if you want to go to point eight zones you're pushing your price point up to over 250 three four hundred dollars. So this is probably the best quality fan you're gonna get for sound. And cfm. And it has this little picture here no access required into the attic that only holds true if your fan is currently operating decently. And it's just tired ugly at all. So if you're replacing the fan definitely the invent series just make sure you grab the right one on the way out. So you don't pay for the hundred. And forty cfm if you don't need to. So here's our fan really quick. And simple this housing comes out i'm going to demonstrate how this goes together here before i get up in the ladder it's very tricky to see me do it when i'm up there. But this is the exhaust part that goes on the fan. Now if you can imagine we have our fan installed okay. And we pull the ducting through from the other side connect the ducting to the end of this. And then what happens as this gets after this is in the ceiling you push this up through. And the idea here. And you can see this one there's these two little tabs. And push it through an angle. And you straighten it out all right. And then from the inside you can actually screw that in place. And then once that is done. Then you can slide your fan housing in all right. And that's how it all connects. And all of this work can be done from down here which is why this is awesome. So the only thing that's in your way before you get started are these tabs. So this frame is also designed for traditional installation before drywall. So what you do just take your pliers. And the installations in this box are actually quite good okay you can follow them to a tee. And any metal just give it a little bit of working. And you're heating it up. And it snaps off okay. And what this does is it creates a housing that is smaller than the flange you cut the hole to this dimension. And then use install it up. And then hopefully you'll have wood in the ceiling that you can screw to yeah. So the only thing you really got to do when you're replacing a fan in this situation is have wood in the ceiling to screw this to you don't have any you're gonna have to install it at some point all right there we go the other thing that you have inside here is the electrical compartment. And there's a tab here all right. Now it has a little catch all right. So you just push that in. And lift it out. And that's got your power. And you set that aside for later. And then you'll see this the little thing here. Now there's a hole here for the electrics. But if you're sliding it straight up you don't want your wire coming from the side you want your wire coming from the top. So you push that tab to close the other hole. So if you want to come from the side of the fan you push the tab inside. And you bring the wiring this way if you want the electrics to come from the top of the fan you push the tab cover the other way nice. And simple one thing you're gonna need to do let's go to the store. And buy yourself a package of five of these because they don't sell them individually in most cases these little moretz cable connectors are called you use these a lot pot lights. And that sort of thing. So if you're getting handy at home having these around are great you also need the same thing if you're gonna change your hug fan. And they just pinch. And stick in the hole there we go. Then that holds the unit the idea here is you put your cable in here. And it holds the wire from coming loose okay that way when you make your connections in your box you know nothing's going to come loose over time. And you're not gonna get a short. Now we've got our housing prepped we know that we want the exhaust running that way all right. So we've come up here alright. So like a lot of fans especially when you see that kind of a lousy duck connection the ceiling has got some damage right. So we're gonna just because our fan is actually about the same width this way. So what we're gonna do is we're going to just take that train of information yeah we're going to just cut back a little bit more ceiling. So that the fan will actually sit up in that hole. And we're going to cut it back. Now here's the best part they make this fan a little bit bigger than your traditional fan that you've already got in your house. So most houses i've got a fifty to sixty eighty cfm 110 is just a little bit bigger which means you can make the hole a little bit bigger. And you're not gonna be left patching your ceiling. So very typical the electrical is not long enough for the installation because the power goes in into a different corner in the box. So i'm fine here or here. But as long as i have my insulation my duct blowing that way my power actually comes to the back corner. So bear with me because this housing i can only blow in that direction or that direction. So that pets the power in this back corner if i go this way. So i want to have enough ducting. Now to go this way. And then softly curl around to go back up yeah that means i want to have enough to go from here to there okay this looks like a lot of ducting. But the reality is. So when you buy a whole box of this stuff yeah you got enough to run a good couple of fans. So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to lift this up into place. And encourage it to go the right direction nice. And easy there we go nice big loop i don't want any real sharp corners here okay. And now i'm ready to install this whoo. So now i've got everything in place i want to just push my ducting up. And out of the way knowing where to grab it get my wiring make sure the switch is off. And push it through a little grommet there we go. And now the fan will go straight up into this hole alright great spot to screw that right there the box actually comes with holes that you can use as report me when in doubt put it anywhere you like. And then remember the housing is around. So any inside corner. Then a couple inches there's lots of room for a screw there you go. Now this side of the fan there isn't any wood within a couple inches. So i'm just gonna grab some 3-inch screws to get some extra support. Now when you're doing the screw on the,https://youtu.be/pE7NIS0TLJg?t=28,"['What is the main reason why the bathroom fan was saved during the renovation project?', 'Why did the client mention that he had moisture coming into his bathroom?', 'What type of ducting is recommended for a bathroom exhaust system?', 'How does the new fan installation work from inside the space?', 'What are some common mistakes to avoid when installing a new bathroom fan?']"

But when you're upstairs in any house in the summertime air conditioning or not it's comfortable here it's warm here this is hot there's just no two ways around that. So need a little duct tape because when i drove my screw i brought open up the box a little bit. And i want to have as much of an air seal in here as i can. So i'm directing all the air out of this box there we go all right kids here we go yeah we bring our exhaust line okay. Now it only goes in one way perfect. Now in this situation we don't need a gear clamp like we did upstairs because we're dealing with plastic all right we're gonna rely just on the duct tape to make this connection it's nice to have lots of extra wine here because it's. So easy to work you can pull it through. And the where it's comfortable there we go okay yeah how we do is to push that through the other side. Now you'll notice we have those two tabs that are through like we demonstrate earlier. And now we've got to put in our set screw okay ah the duct line is actually attached okay. So just to recap we have made our hole bigger attached our duct got a nice loop no more moisture running down our head problem the wiring is finished luckily for us deo is the homeowner. And he's here working on projects. Now a fan ask especially a fixture. So homeowners allowed to change a fixture not a problem all you do is connect the black in the way.

Now for anybody at home who's not familiar with wiring i'm gonna give you a quick tutorial i think you left the stuff here if you're changing a fixture. And in your area most like you're allowed to a lot of these safety codes along north america relatively the same you really all you need is a pair of these this is a just a simple little wire cutter. And you'll notice all the different holes that's four different wire sizes okay. So traditionally wire in homes is 14 gauge. And so on the side it'll have the different numbers you just put it in the 14 spot press it a quarter turn. And the cap pops off okay that's simple you go three quarters of an inch long that's it you just put the two wires together take a pair of square in pliers. And you give it a couple of twists all right pinch the end together. And if you don't like the way it's sitting you just take the side give it a snip you got a nice little finish down like that. And you can use these these little blue moretz what do they call can twist there's different makers. And models out there. But the idea is the package should say what size wire the marette works for. And how many wires you can use usually it's a maximum of four. But two wires. And you just twist it. And twist it. And twist it. And twist it. And twist it. And then when you look at it you shouldn't see any copper showing okay you don't need tape it's not necessary it's waste of time if you have to use tape on your joint your wires too long take the cap off snip it back you black to black white to white ground-to-ground anybody can wire their own fixture all right there you go. Now all we have left to do. Now is stick in our housing ah here we go you slide this up. And it will click into place. And then you have to take these last two screws. And you just mount this here. So over time with all the vibrations of operation that doesn't pop out on you all right one on each side. And there we go. Now take your plug off. And you insert it into the little box the receptacle there for it. And then when you just put the fan cover on. Now unfortunately when we were doing this we had a little bit of issue to overcome because the framing was too tight together there's some extra wood in the roof we need to cut that out. And we caused a little bit damage no big deal where's comes to worse you take your hardener mud a couple of coats touch-up paint. And you're good to go ok. So the last part is this. Then the last part is actually the trickiest this is the hardest part of the whole fan they get these little spring clip things. And you want to have them sitting in your fan. And rolling this over here like mmm a big letter m make sure your clip is sitting properly before you try to compress it ok. And what you want to do is pinch these together like this. And then one side goes in that i'm gonna try to do this with a camera can pick it up here we go okay can you see how that works. And then when you flush up how you focus your mice when you push up it goes like that. And pulls it nice. And tight ok. So we'll do both. So it's attached. And just hanging nice. And loose here we go. But when you're done just give it a shove it'll snap it right into the ceiling you'll be perfect. And i gotta go do another coat of mine. But listen that's all there is to installing a fan one thing we have to do we have to turn on. And try it though right that's the big oh. Now there you go that's one sone sounds like a fan in the distance. But it's not that loud alright it's not distracting it's not squeaking isn't that screeching. But it is pulling 110 cubic feet per minute out of this room give you an idea this room is 8 by 8 by 8 right. So about 4 minutes. So if you run your fan for 4 or 5 minutes after you're done your shower your bathroom will stay nice. And dry you won't ever get any mold that's perfect that's a do it yourselfer project that should be able to save your bathroom.

And in the previous video you seen me install these floor joist on the cabin build. And in today's video i want to show you how to deal with the stairwell opening how to finish framing that for the floor joist. So i've got a few things prepped up here i've built the outer section that's just solely sitting on the basement wall. So this inside edge is just flush with the inside of the basement wall. And obviously this is flush with the outside  this area here obviously before you sheet the floor it's going to have to be insulated because you're not going to be able to get into it again because it's all closed up. So make sure you don't forget to insulate areas like that before you put your sheeting down  just to talk about a few things. So how did i determine my opening size well most times if you're working off a plan that's all going to be predetermined for you. So in my case  i had that all figured out on my drawing. And just simply took some measurements got everything  measured off. And cut to what i needed. And i already installed those floor joists that are cut short as you can see including the blocking along the beam. And everything. So so in today's video i'm going to show you how to install that rim piece that you see laying on top to the end of those cut joist. And then  we can't just leave that whole thing in this case like that we need to support that  those floor joists that are hanging off the beam we need to support it with another beam. And post underneath. Now i like this system when the stairwell is perpendicular with the  floor joist  as opposed to some more expensive systems where you've actually got to replace this floor joist with a   like a engineered beam right from the steel beam in the house over to the edge. And as well this one would have to be an engineered beam as well instead of just a regular floor joist with this system here because i'm already going to have a wall anyways along the stair case  in the basement there's no reason that i can't have a a beam. And post supporting those floor joist hidden in that wall. And it's it just saves all it probably saves  probably a couple thousand dollar actually on this particular setup. So you still need a beam. And everything to support that. But you just have a little less materials. And engineered products than  doing it the other way. So i think  that's about it for the intro we'll get right into this okay. So i'm down working off a a scaffold. So i can be down a decent level here to to do this. So this is the plate. So this is actually going to go on like that onto the end here i've already got it pre-marked out here. And all i all i had to do to figure out those marks is just basically measure what my layout is which is 16 on 16 in on center cuz this here is going to go right against this last ful length  joist. So it's just continue  a continuation of my 16inch centers. So that's marked out i added a block on both ends on the bottom side of the two end joist just. So when i flip this down it can sit on there. And i don't have to actually hold that thing up. And balance. And nail. And everything else it it will basically sit there while i work. So basically the nailing pattern is just going to be i'll be nailing through this into these ends. So i'm just just going to be putting one nail in each one  that's really all you need because this whole end is going to be. Then supported by the beam underneath. So this is really just lipstick on a pig it's just finishing this opening. And basically keeping the spacing of these joist. So so there's nothing real structural about this this beam here or this piece here. And this is the same material as i used on the whole rest of the outside  floor system. And you will would have seen that in the previous video as long as you watched it go check it out while i'm on that topic click the thumbs up subscribe to the channel i know you like what you see you keep coming,https://youtu.be/KP5nF3b4MP8?t=0,"['What is the purpose of insulating areas like the stairwell opening before sheeting down?', 'How did the author determine their opening size for the floor joist?', 'What type of beam and post system does the author recommend for supporting floor joists in a stairwell opening?', 'Why would using this system instead of replacing the floor joist with an engineered beam be more cost-effective?', 'What is the main purpose of the ""lipstick on a pig"" technique used by the author when finishing the stairwell opening?']"

Now i just won't put it backwards got me distracted. So i can set that down on my blocks. And it'll basically sit there. And i'm using a 3. And 1/2 in  ring shank nails. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to flush these to the bottom of this piece. So i'll just lift that up to my mark oops. And turn the nailer on here we go [applause]. So i'm just going to continue on all the way along there nailing each [applause] [applause] one. And then on these these ends i don't think i mentioned that actually okay. So these are the floor joist that we're using. So these are a tji this is the abbreviation for them  to be quite honest i don't even know what that stands for. So common  term though for in construction for this type of joist. So we basically have an osb web. And then  the top. And bottom cords in this case they're solid lumber on on these ones. But sometimes they'll even be engineered  lumber like this. But these ones are solid wood prefer the solid wood ones  this this is a 9. And 1/2 in tgi tji  they come in different heights. So depending on your span whatever they'll be specked differently what was the point i was getting to  oh yes. So you notice we have a void here right on these particular ones this is a this is 1 in difference from the face here to there. So what i what i did in the very two end tjis that went full length is i needed to fill in that void. And i just simply used two layers a/2 in plywood to to create a flat surface here. So that'll that'll do a couple things that'll help with drywalling cuz we can just drywall right across it or whatever. But it also gives me a nice surface here to nail through because i'm going to nail through that web into the end of these at both ends again remember none of this is structural if it was structural we'd be doing joist hangers. And everything which you still could do if you wanted to. But it's really not needed in this case since this is going to be supported by a beam from the bottom anyways sliver. So i had a mark over here which is this face of of this  joist. And i know it's sitting down on my block down here. So i can  put a few nails through the end of it. And that's just to keep keep it from twisting or anything hey they all even hit the wood perfect okay same thing on this side i've got a mark here already. And i'm just going to fire through this back side of the web through that thickened part that i added on this side. And into the into the rim [applause] that one felt like it missed. But it didn't okay. So we've got that all nice. And solid. But there'll be some bounce out here right because this still isn't structurally strong enough hanging off that that beam that's over there or whatever it is 8 ft away where those blocks are. So that's why we need to. Now go in the basement. And support that with a proper  beam. And telepost that'll be our next step oh man those are in there those ring shank nails hold don't want to knock my new saw off oops okay okay. So now we're down in the basement  this is you can obviously see the stairwell opening here this is where the beam's going to go it's going to sit right underneath here flush to this inside. And back to wherever it ends up here these each one of these pieces is inch. And 3/4 i believe yeah. So will be  3. And 1 half in thick total when it's when it's built i want to catch this joist here with the end of the beam. And it doesn't have to catch this one i think it ends up just catching this last short one somewhere here i forget just where it stops i know i cut it at 10 ft. Now you might be wondering what the straps are about. So i was just doing some redneck engineering thinking about this. And i thought just trying to figure out how i can hold that beam up there till i get my post all in place. And everything. So we just hung some ratchet straps one at each end. So we should be able to stick the beam through this. So it'll hang off of there on both ends i can kind of suck it up pretty pretty close i think with the ratchet straps as well. So we'll see it might be a fail. But it'll hold it up there. And keep it from falling on our heads anyways. Now i had mentioned that  there's going to be telepost under here. So i've got a mark on the floor pretty much where i want them hopefully to be. And part of that is that underneath the concrete floor there's a there's a concrete footing an 8 in thick footing that's  i think they were 30 in by 30 in. So there's extra reinforcement there. So i mean we've got some play right to left here. But i pretty much need to be centered this way. So that i end up in the wall where i want it to be. But i do have a little bit of play this way couple inches one way or the other isn't going to make a huge difference. So to start out with i'm,https://youtu.be/KP5nF3b4MP8?t=284,"['What type of nails is being used for the joist?', 'Why are ring shank nails preferred over regular nails?', 'What is the purpose of using plywood to fill in voids under the joists?', 'How will the beam be supported and secured in place?', 'What is the role of telepost in this construction project?']"

So to start out with i'm going to nail this lvl together. So this is  basically an engineered laminated beam  this particular one's made out of plywood you can get them made out of like  almost like osb it's not quite the same. But it's similar. But this one's plywood it's going to be two pes i already said they're inch. And 3/4 each. And this load this beam is going to be just top loaded. So really we we only need to nail  on this height of beam  four nails every 12 in on one side. But i i'm probably going to i am going to nail it on both sides it's just force a habit. But when you're dealing with these types of beams there's no crown to them or anything. So you don't need to look for a crown  just basically flush them up. And on the on the ends. And the bottom. And nail it off. So so i'm going to start by doing that. So i've got  what are those 3. And a/4 in nails in my nailer this is going to be a total of 3. And 1/2 in. So they shouldn't poke through the other side if i was nailing a just normal one by type boards together. And it was only 3 inches thick these nails would poke through the other side. But if you nail them at a bit of an angle. Then usually they won't come through the other side. So just a little little pro tip there for you in this case i can just nail straight in not have to worry. So we look pretty good there a lot of nail guns will not nail these nails flush into this type of material this this milwaukee is incredible okay. So i don't think i mentioned i mentioned the thickness. But the  total height this is 9 and2. So it's actually the same  same height as our floor joist. And again these these can come in all different  heights maybe maybe,https://youtu.be/KP5nF3b4MP8?t=701,"['What type of material are engineered laminated beams typically made of?', 'How many nails are needed to secure a top-loaded beam?', 'Why is it necessary to nail both sides of the beam?', 'Can you use normal type boards with 3-inch thickness and 3-1/2 inch nails?', 'Will all nail guns be able to nail into engineered laminated beams without issue?']"

And again these these can come in all different  heights maybe maybe what i'll do i'll preet up my telepost get them set up roughly to height. And then that way  it's less time that the beam has to hang in that in those straps there. So that is  93. And we'll call it 38 that's about a quarter. So we need to be in that range minus our 9 and2. So easiest way to do something like this  without hurting your brain doing math i know to the top of this is going to be about 93. And 38 or a quar i just line my tape up. And read what it is down here. And that's that's what i need for my post height. So we're looking for about 83. And 1 half would get us close. And then i can adjust it from there okay. So these posts  what was specked i think was speced for 3,000 lb posts these posts are like 8,000 lb. So i've got more than enough post more than enough strength i should say. So these  these posts are adjustable. So all the parts are what you see here okay. So you've got a plate plate for the top plate for the bottom  sorry i should rephrase that one plate for the bottom of the post. And the the top plate actually goes on the underside of the beam that you're mounting okay  this pin fits in these holes this is what makes the post adjustable. So you can get it close to what you need put this pin through the hole it slides down. And then this is your adjustable part of this this  telepost. So this would sit in in the top of the post. And this is on the underside of your your beam or whatever you're supporting. So it sit like that there's a hole in there. And the pin on the top of here needs to needs to go in there okay. Now something else if you look on these plates there's these three little nubs  i always like to put those up against the wood. So that when you get some pressure on there those kind of sink in there. And it basically holds it in place. But we will be installing bolts as well. But just good practice to put those up  on the concrete you can't really can't really put them up. So then they go inside the [music] post which is honestly what they're really for. But just about everybody does it the other way. So so yeah. So the bottom one those are in the post. And that just gives the post a little bit of something to come up against if it happens to get smacked or whatever okay. So anybody remember that number cuz i don't 93. And 5/8 i think or 38 was our total  83. And a half. So we've got we've got to kind of include these thicknesses as well. So we need about another 6 in for that. So 83 and2 2 three four five six we're somewhere in that range okay. So these posts are made to do a lot of different heights. So now for the height we need i've pulled it out far enough that there's no more holes right. But all you have to do is flip the around. Now and that that basically gives you what you need one two three four. So somewhere in that range we'll try we'll sneak up to this hole i think that'll still work come on in there okay. And on that pin. So that pin that goes through there those holes there's these little indents those need to go down. And they hook in the top of the lower part of the pipe. And that's. So that once there's weight on there that pin can't slide one way or the other. So i think at that position we're going to be i think we're going to be all right i'll just give a little quick check here yeah we were looking for about 85. And a half. So we should be really close right there sorry i keep dropping that plate it's probably loud. So i'll get these posts just laid close for. Now so remember i had the crosshairs here on the floor for my post location. So with that hole in the middle i can actually line that up if i want to get some marks out on the outside just to give me a better idea once i'm moving that post around cuz i'm not going to see my crosshairs once that plate's sitting there. So if i need it to be fairly particular that's one way to know what you're looking for okay. So we got that we've got this post set [applause] up move it over here. So we don't trip on it hopefully. And i'll set the second post up we were in the third hole down just going to get things. So they're close for us okay i think we're ready to heave that baby up in there your post is too short oh yes i flipped it the wrong way [applause] thanks somebody's going to comment on that oh i see you changed your post i was screaming at the screen thank you it's just cuz it is heavy. So i don't want don't want anybody to hurt themselves let's roll it like [applause] yep oh yeah no problem that's probably good. And actually that's that's pretty decent where it's hanging even for  side to side i'll probably have to adjust it over a little bit. But let me go. And try. And see if  i can just ratchet it up that way these probably aren't the best ones to use for this cuz they have a quick release that works except that i think both straps are exactly where the plate's going to sit for the pipe for the post oh no of course oh of course it is okay well that's easy enough i'll  i'll release one at a time. And just slide them over cuz yeah this is going to be it's going to be. So close just better off to have them out of the way. So i'm going to slide those straps over.

Now so we'll just get the post  posts underneath there close. And then i can check them for plum. And everything after that [applause] quite gusty today the wind it's better than the rain we've been having i mean we need rain last year it was. So dry we had forest fires everywhere. But last couple weeks have been kind of extreme okay. So we're in the ballpark there do the same thing with this one oh oh i went the fourth hole [applause] believe me when i tell you when you're working with these don't ever forget about those plates not being secure because you don't want them falling on your head. And don't ask me how i [applause] know okay. So i've just kind of got them finger snug up there oops. So that i can move things around a little bit. And i'll just  check them for plum like i said i kind of had a position at the floor that i kind of would like these to stay. So i'm pretty good. So that one's pretty nice oop oops wrong way that's deadly okay. So so. Now i can take a wrench. Now i'll just snug those up once  once we get the subfloor. And that on a little bit of weight on this i'll come down. And readjust get everything how i want it. But for. Now i just we know that we put that straight piece across there. So we should be pretty flat i just want to kind of take up i don't want to lift them off the wall over there just kind of get some weight off them. Then i'm going to take these i don't know what they are inch. And 3/4 jr what are they grk screws. But they're basically a structural screw they don't come with the pole you could use a leg bolt i like these cuz you usually don't have to pre-drill. So that'll keep that plate for moving up [applause] there my plate twisted a little bit okay. So that will keep those plates from  slipping. And sliding the ones on the floor i will fasten to the concrete as well we don't have inf floor heat tubing or anything like that. So i don't have to worry about that. But if you do have inflor heat be cautious of of that  if you had infloor heat i would probably just use some peel adhesive. And stick them to the floor once that they won't go anywhere. But i just don't have my drill right. Now but i will put a couple anchors in there just some  looks like they're about i don't know they might be quarter in holes. So i'll use some quarter inch hammer. And anchors. And bolt those plates to the floor as well. So like i said this this works well. And is a little bit cheaper than doing the you know the engineered beams. And stuff at each end like i had mentioned before. And this is going to be a wall anyways. So these posts will be in the wall. And nobody know any difference  this is going to be a plumbing wall. So it's nice. And thick. And it'll hide those posts you can see that i'm supporting this is the very first cut off joist at this end this is a full one this is the very first cut off joist i'm supporting all the other cut off joists plus i'm supporting this joist that's full length where the top of the stairs will be attached to. And it'll just give it take a little bit of bounce out of the stairs. So the stairs when they're in here are going to be coming down here back in that area. So now that's all all that's left to do is i've got to go up. And basically toenail that that very first  rim board that i put on toenail it down into the beam. And maybe i'll even throw the odd nail  through this flange on the joist into the beam too. And that'll just keep it from being able to kick out. And when i do that i'll just flush this this side of the beam up with everything in the stairwell side. So and. Then i'll recheck my  plum of my poles it's actually pretty flush. Now but i probably will have to adjust my plum just a little bit. So i think that's that's the main gist of everything that i want to show you there  the floor joist system is just about complete i've got a little bit more blocking to do here. And there. And some final little touches. And then we're going to do the sheathing. And there'll be a video for that. So keep watching for it this cabin build we're going to have a ton of videos you're not going to want to miss any of them. So again click the thumbs up subscribe to our channel.

So here's a pair of work gloves that i've had for several years. And they've done a really really good job the back of the glove is a synthetic fiber of course you can see the fingertips here reinforced on this  you know on the top of your hand. And of course on the underside on the palm side of your hand you know this is a very nice thin leever leather it's got reinforced patches. And of course it's got extra reinforcing up here you know at the fingertips. So when  you know you you really use the gloves. And grip  you know you've got extra material there. And of course it has you know the nice  hoop. And loop you know the  velcro if that's what you want to call it  straps you know to. So you can cinch them tight around your wrist these are really really good if you're working with with  around a fire because this part of the glove leather is not going to burn very easily you just have to be careful about getting embers  back on here cuz if that synthetic fiber melts  you can burn yourself pretty seriously very quickly here's a nice  lightweight glove  this is made from nylon a synthetic fiber this is a light duty work glove. And you can see a very kind of a unique design  it's got you know nice elastic bands to keep it tight around your wrist. So that you don't get any grit down in your  you know down down into your hands. And the underside is coated with a nitri foam  that's a lot like i guess the best way to describe it is rubber. And that's kind of what it looks like it's kind of sticky it offers really really great gripping power. And of course that material wraps around at the finger tips you know. And at the thumb tips you know as you can see here. And the reason why is in case you're handling wet material  your hands will stay dry. Now if it's raining outside. And you're getting water up here your hands not going to be dry. But frequently you might be working with wet material. And and it's nice to keep your hands dry this coating is going to do that here's basically the same glove. But it's got a couple of extra features it's it's it's a medium duty glove. And same nylon you know backing  it's got of course you know the syn strap you know to  draw tight around your wrist i particularly like the little name tag area you can take a sharpie marker. And write your initials here in case several people at the job site have got the same glove you'll know whose gloves whose. And the coating here the the nitro foam coating on the underside of this glove is a little thicker. And i think you can tell that it it it's it's a little thicker a little bit more body to it. And same thing it kind of wraps around here to waterproof you know the fingertips. And the thumb tips of this glove gl. So really really interesting work gloves. And of course there's many many other ones. But these are some fantastic work gloves if you're going to purchase some work gloves just make sure that  they don't all fit the same  some gloves an extra large just barely fits my hand other ones the large fits perfectly. So you're going to have to test them out  you might want to if you're ordering them online you might have to order a couple different pair. And send back the ones that don't fit  understand that for just about any different task  they make a glove for that task. And i can tell you it pays to get the right glove for what you're doing  it'll it'll make your hands very very comfortable  you can be safe. So that your hands don't get injured.

And the top edge of the tub to the center of the fixtures. Then transfer those measurements to the side panel. And mark the fixture locations the side panels have a folding flap that will wrap around the corner. And onto the back wall to create a watertight joint there is a crease for that fold molded into the panel when transferring the measurement from the back corner to the fixture centers i'm careful to measure from the crease rather than the edge of the panel i mark the location for the faucet the shower valve. And the shower arm next i place the panel on a piece of rigid foam insulation a piece of plywood or heavy cardboard can also work this is to protect the floor when i drill through the panel. Then using a hole saw i more holes for the fixture. Now it's time to bend the panel along the crease. And create the flap that will extend into the corner.

And the fixture holes board i do a test fit to make sure that everything aligns properly i tape the left panel in place temporarily while i go to work on the opposite end section. And the back wall next i make the fold on the right panel no boring is necessary here since there are no fixtures on this wall here too i test fit the panel. And use masking tape to hold it in place for the moment finally i put up the panel for the back wall align the edges. And apply masking tape to keep things in position with all three panels up i stand back. And get an overall view. And once i'm satisfied everything looks good draw a pencil line around the top. And side edges i'll use this line as a guide when i apply the adhesive. So as to avoid getting any excess material on the wall. Now that everything is outlined i remove the masking tape. And take the panels down to make cleanup easier apply strips of masking tape along the pencil outline. And around the top edges of the bathtub well we've done our test fit. And everything fits perfectly. Now it's time to put our panels up permanently we'll be using frp adhesive fiberglass reinforced plastic panel adhesive to adhere the panels to the wall to make sure the panels stick without a problem i do a final wipe down using a clean dry cloth to remove any dust or particles from the surface with a putty knife i apply adhesive to the edge of a notched trowel. Now to spread the adhesive on the wall i keep the trowel fairly flat. Then tip it up on edge about 30 degrees to create uniform arrows or ridges when the panel is put up these ridges will flatten ensuring that the adhesive makes uniform contact with the back of the panel. And compensating for any undulations or unevenness in the walls i'll be honest here this can be a somewhat messy process. But i avoid rushing since this adhesive has a work time of 30 to 45 minutes. Now this is quick grab adhesive that we'll be using for that flap we folded up the one that will go into. And around the corner i apply it in a zigzag pattern starting in the corner. And coming out about six to eight inches okay well it's time for the moment of truth although there's really not much suspense here since i've pre-tested the fit using the flat of my hand i press the panel firmly into the adhesive. Then i use a j roller to make sure any air bubbles are pressed out. Now it's important here to move from the center of the panel to the edges alternately i could use a heavy rag. And perform the same operation again starting in the center. And moving outward with the left panel up i move to the right panel first applying the rfp adhesive. Then the high-tech instant grab material. And finally setting the panel in position.

And apply a bead inside the channel. Then i pull the edge of the panel away from the wall slip on the j trim apply another bead to the back of the trim.

But just to make certain the panels don't move while the adhesive dries i apply strips of masking tape around the edges when the adhesive is set i take them off i apply a bead of white silicone sealant where the bottom of the panel meets the tub again this is to ensure a watertight seal to create a smooth professional looking finish i spray on a solution of water denatured alcohol.

And pulled into plymouth massachusetts you know home of the plymouth rock you might say our hosts the boderthas own a piece of the rock or at least a piece next to the rock good morning susan how are you hi ron great to have you here in plymouth well thank you very much me. And my rolling workshop great what a thing to have in your front yard what a sculpture well ron that's the forefathers monument built in the late 1800s. And on it is the name of each individual who came over on the mayflower wow. And this house right here is the monument house. And for years the caretaker for the monument lived here right here right here right. So this house is 150 years old you bet can you show me the inside sure love to have you follow you guys look at this old house old room ron as you can tell where the wall meets the ceiling we do have a problem we had some flat molding up there that we took down. And we'd like to get some crown molding up there okay we can do that. And that's not all we want to put a cornice box over this old pipe here it's a steam pipe over this pipe gets pretty hot. So where will that go  above it'll come out from the wall. And it'll cover the tops of the curtains which will be hanging underneath it. And it will continue over to this side all the way across to that side. And the insulation will keep the drapes from getting scorched that's right i think we can do both of those let's measure up that's great i've drawn a working line here which is going to be the approximate end of the cornice we're going to make the corners out of three quarter inch plywood what i want to check is to be sure that i've got a space here between the pipe. And the inside of the cornice box. And let's say that's about a half an inch that should be enough. So let's measure the distance. Then from the edge of the window frame out to that line that's five inches susan measures five inches down on her side. Then we use the level to draw a vertical or plumb line down from the ceiling the cornice will be seven. And one quarter inches out from the wall in order to clear the pipe. And allow space for the curtain rod. And then we should come down far enough to cover the top of the sill i'd say about eleven. And a half or twelve would do that i'll put it the bottom of it about right here good. So let's go cut some wood huh great. Now how about this huh new portable workshop new saw i mean eat your heart out right honey this is on the christmas list you know this is the material that we're going to be using for the cornice right here it's three quarter inch thick birch vineyard plywood nice. And flat turns out susan is pretty handy. And she stepped right up to the saw push it in all the way in excellent. And this will be one of our ends right here.

So we're gonna set this saw up or reset the saw for that cut rich if you could loosen that up. And tilt it over to 45 degrees there okay good for a really strong hold we apply glue with a brush to the beveled edges. Then use these corner clamps to hold the piece steady while we secure it with our nail gun this is a nail gun i got six penny finish nails in here you're left-handed right i like using a combination of glue. And nails this way we don't have to wait for the glue to set completely. And we can move on all right this is the top of the cornish. Now i'm really putting this in here for structural  strength as much as anything else. And also to keep the dust off the top of your drapes. Now we're going to cut out this top to fit over that steam pipe which was the reason for this whole project in the first place [applause] very nice good all right. Now we'll put a little trim on this. And we're just about ready to take it inside yeah this is perfect timing i just got the brackets up we used two inch right angle brackets for mounting the corners to the wall. And there you have it. So is that what you had in mind susan that's just gonna do the trick for you that's just perfect. So we've got a whole bunch of crown rolling to put up. Now right with your name on it my name i'm not going anywhere for a while i could tell all right let's start on that part we're ready. Now the situation we have here is kind of typical of a lot of old houses walls. And ceilings that are not perfectly straight. So to help us put the crown molding up i'm going to use these little corner blocks which i've cut we'll put one of these every few inches every place we can find a stud or some bracing to attach them i'll first put some construction adhesive on the back. And then nail them to the wall studs that we located earlier i think we might have a problem as i'm getting ready to install the molding i come across a little problem up on the ceiling some sagging plaster. So i decide to perform a little surgery i apply some quick drying patching plaster have some lunch.

So basically all we have for,https://youtu.be/39ZB4fe9KVE?t=0,"['What type of wood did you use for your custom closet door?', 'How do you attach the mirror to the frame?', 'What is the purpose of using a full-length mirror in the door?', 'Can you explain the process of framing your own door?', 'Why did you choose rustic gray barn board instead of traditional materials?']"

So basically all we have for building materials is some rustic barn board this is actually not from a barn it's brand new material it's available at the local building store i'm not sure how long this trend is gonna be around. So if you want to do something like this get on it what you can our mirror here is five feet by 16 inches. And max has conveniently ducked out of the reflection on that shot well years ago our hole that we're trying to cover is 33 inches. So i could have bought a 34 inch door i could about a 36 inch door instead i'm gonna build my own they come in one by eight well that's actually almost 8 inches nice usually it's a little shorter if i put that together side by side. And picture frame my mirror i'm still not gonna be wide enough. So what i'm gonna do is i've ripped a couple of boards down we're gonna take advantage of the width of this board. And i'm gonna interior picture frame it. Then i have my barn board. And the next year you're framing as well that way my door is wider than the hall you don't want to have a situation where you're relying on the how you level your door. And how you build your house to be perfectly level all the time. So when you have a sliding door make sure your door is bigger than your walls okay when you close it you can't see what's behind. And you don't have the vantage point of things lining up to see all those little airs that's a good idea all you need to do this is basically a drill some mending plates there's a lot of different kinds. So find out what you like to work with some screws. And some rear clips nice. And simple because i'm picture framing i'm also going to use a few brad nails. So i've got my compressor here. But if you don't have a compressor you could just screw it together. So keep that in mind we'd like to try to keep our project simple here. So let's get busy we're gonna nail. And cut this together i'm not gonna take you through the step-by-step. But basically you want to make a frame that's just a little bit smaller than your mirror make the back side nice. And flush. And when you're done building you can lay the mirror on top screw some mirror clips. And you're good to go. So the key to this whole project,https://youtu.be/39ZB4fe9KVE?t=54,"['What type of material is being used for the barn board?', 'How wide should a sliding door be compared to its walls?', 'What tools are needed to build a simple picture frame?', 'Can a sliding door be built without a compressor?', 'Why is it important to make a frame slightly smaller than the mirror?']"

And you're good to go. So the key to this whole project is to measure the size of your mirror which is an actual 16 inches. And make sure that framework that you're working with here interior is less than that we've done with a 15. And a quarter inch interior measurement you can see you. So that when my mirror sits on it i've got about 3/8 on each side. And that'll be perfect to make sure that we never have a problem sliding out it also cuts down how per slice you need to be when building. So we're gonna fire in a couple of brad's just to get everything nice. And tight again because all this is rustic i'm not as concerned with how we line it up as much as we are making sure the back is flush. So just nice. And pressure on the floor. So i'm more concerned with how lined up on the inside of this frame ok. And there we go we have our frame okay right. So because we're using rustic lumber we do not want to trust the end cuts or square we're building a door all of our joints have to be perfectly square make sure you have your table saw locked in position. So what we're gonna do is we're going to pre-cut all the ends perfect 90s. And that'll help when we're building to make sure everything stays square. And you know just solve a lot of pain as we get down the road okay,https://youtu.be/39ZB4fe9KVE?t=170,"['What is the size of the mirror in this project?', 'How does the interior measurement of the framework affect the mirror placement?', 'Why are pre-cut 90-degree ends important for this project?', 'What type of lumber is used in this project and why is it chosen?', 'How can using rustic lumber impact the accuracy of the joints in the frame?']"

And you know just solve a lot of pain as we get down the road okay. So the first rule of design is it has to function right. So the barn door why in the world are they popular it's because oh we'll tell you all about this whole nate's cutting lumber the reason we like barn doors in the design perspective is because we can close the space. And separate it from another space. And at the same time by sliding across the wall we remove the need for a swing or something folding door. And restricting your access into that space. So by having a barn door here we solve the problem of making a room that's 10 by 10. And making it feel like it's 10 by 12 that's key. So if you have a small bedroom putting on one of these doors is awesome for giving you that extra space in your room. So now you you have an extra couple feet to mess around with the other thing we're gonna do with our door is we're gonna solve the problem of where are we gonna put our full-length mirror because in this room it would have gone probably on this wall. So now we're gonna have a full-length mirror in the door. And it'll be a dressing mirror. And it can slide back. And forth killing two birds with one stone the other thing is since we're building it ourselves we're saving money the door rail systems about 135 materials here mirror included are about 100 bucks. So for 250 you can make your own custom barn door to fit any space it's a lot better than going to the store. And buying these things or the kits are up to $500 for something that looks rustic this is rustic. And you did it yourself saving money okay. So the way that we're,https://youtu.be/39ZB4fe9KVE?t=247,"['What is the primary function of barn doors in design?', 'How do barn doors solve a common problem in room layout?', 'Why are full-length mirrors often placed on walls?', 'What is the benefit of building a custom barn door versus buying a kit?', 'How much can you save by making your own custom barn door?']"

And you did it yourself saving money okay. So the way that we're gonna build this thing. So that we can keep everything exactly square. And not have any issues is we're gonna use rely on the fact that we cut this edge 90. And we're just gonna go with flush okay here we're gonna hold the wood together as we come along get up to here. And then we're gonna measure what i call eyeball measuring i'm gonna put a pencil mark right off the edge of the wood. But the same thickness is my saw blade. And i'm gonna tell my son when he cuts this to start cutting here. And then slide the wood in until he's eating all of the pencil. And then cut the board oh here he is let's let them in on the secret. So what i've done is i've got flesh. And i'm coming right up to this point. So when you're cutting i want you to cut to hit the blade here okay. And then slide the wood towards the blade until the last bit of pencil is eaten just right at that point okay. And they finish that cut nice. And square. And we're gonna use that process the whole time. So every time you see these thick pencil marks it's the same kind of cutting style okay yeah beautiful thanks buddy we wanted the back of the door flush. So we'll just work off the floor i always be careful when you're nailing on the next to the floor you don't hold your nail or on an angle because you don't want to fire a nail into your finish floor every eight to ten inches would be plenty remember once we have this assembled we're gonna be using mending plates on the back to hold this all together really nice. And tight when i'm picking my wood i like to pick as much unique detail that the wood allows as possible that detail is what makes wood wood. And hate to eliminate it to try to make it look like something manufactured there you go buddy remember don't panic when you're assembling this this is rough cut lumber there's any knot holes there's gonna be imperfections maybe a little warp you have gaps all of these things work into the overall look. So when you're finished you're gonna have something that looks like it was built in a barn remember when they build barns they don't make them perfect they just get them up. And get them done. So having a little imperfections actually assist you in getting the overall design if you make it too perfect it just kind of looks like it's punched out of a press. And you don't want that okay. Now we're going flesh like it of course it's helpful to have someone standing on your wood to keep everything pressed to the floor quick mid temporary fix until we get the mending plates on we just throw in a couple my nails in under 45 just to hold this door together when i go to flip it over. So in this particular design just to do a picture frame with the barn board one baby it's wasn't wide enough. So we talked about look at options here oh we could add some picture framing trim we ended up needing to trim inside. And outside to bias the extra basically four inches that we needed to make this door you might have a door. Now that has a jam in casings maybe you want to replace it finish it all off the drywall you'll find your hole is 34 inches wide. And you might need a custom door made too you can buy doors in 34. And 36. But you sure won't buy a door like this this is unique. And ever since the quarter that's a complete screw-up it's kind of like a live edge look here that's been finished. But for our purposes the back side is still 7/8 wide i'm gonna use it cuz i love the character that comes in that piece of wood look at that nothing wrong with that long as the outside dimension of what you're building is still working out for you why not use something that otherwise would have been a reject. So when you're doing something like this these systems are basically designed for an 8-foot ceiling. So if you go with a standard door size. And standard ceiling. And nice. And simple in a basement we have to be careful because we want to cover the hole. But not go. So high that the hardware is not going to function. So we're just taking a look at the instructions. And the clearances. And maybe having to do a last-minute assign change. So the instructions for the hardware was basically a picture of how to install they had no dimensions no clearances no numbers to work with. So what we have to do is take the parts out here's our rail. And what we have to do is. Now attach the math to this. So when i hang my door i need clearance that i can come over top of the rail. And set my door on it okay. So i don't need much. So i'm just gonna line this up. And a perfect world of like a couple inches to the ceiling just to be just to be safe. And here's my hole for attaching the door. So split the difference the height of my door basically three quarters of an inch from the rail. So 3/4 + 7. So 7. And 3/4 is my clearance at the top of the door. Now here that takes my door height to this point has a max. So i've got about an inch. And a half to play with here they bring me down to just above my door. So that's nice. So now that i'm measuring my door i want to finish off about 83 at the highest 82 would be nice. But also i'm going to give myself a one inch clearance off the floor. So 81. And a half becomes 82. And a half okay. So that's where i want my door to finish take an inch off 81. And a half inches x left side outside. So in this situation the two options get a couple of guys give you a hand carry this whole door over to your miter saw. And cut your inside minors could be a little tricky or just take the time. And the precaution take your hammer it's only brad nails take this off clean the nails up from the inside cut it. And then reinstall. And that's what we're gonna do nice. And simple be gentle you want to be able to save this for the next time perfect we want to do is have the same gap it's a beveled mirror. So we want to do is have the same gap all the way around we're actually going to use the screws that came in the package. So the screws that we're going to use right here came in the package with the mirror clips they're a little long the point they might stick through. But because of thickness the mirror clip look like that i'll see that it won't come through the other side. So we're gonna be just fine it's also nice. And skinny. And it's a philips baby okay. So we just want to put these into there snug you don't over tighten you can risk splitting the plastic. Then coming through the other side [music] [music] okay. So we're just gonna lay out our mending plates we got six this is just a tie the the basic frame together the hardware for the overhead is going to be attached to a little one by eight up the other end. So by using mending place to tie this together brad nails is kind of a temporary fix this will help keep everything nice. And tight. And square for a long time to come okay don't over screw okay we don't want the screw coming through the other side that is a one inch. And the board is kind of a 7/8 that's it don't drop it right that's the time to have a problem to the side okay.

And slip it into place yeah there you go that's it to cover the joint between the two sections we create a make-believe scab it's a brace that would have been used to join real beams together an authentic scab would have had wooden pegs that passed entirely through the beam ours are only long enough to enhance our illusion with the beam up we turn our attention to the posts once again we start by installing a cleat luckily we find wall studs just where we need them.

So we're gonna pop two of those in today hopefully get them level. And centered square looking pretty we're also gonna have to frame this door we're gonna reframe i'm gonna show you a little cheat for doing exterior door jams. So stay with us we got a lot to go through. And hopefully we get alright. So there are basically two approaches to sticking in a window. And it's all designed driven right one of them is you put your window where the top of the window casing which is what we're gonna call this for lack of a better word. And the top of the door casing are all in a nice straight line. Now in a shed that leaves that window away the heck up here like that. And if you want to go with that design that's fine you could what i would suggest is just put a nice long board temporarily attached across the top. And do all your measurements from that. But i like things simple. And this is the shed. So we're gonna stay simple. And the way i'm going to measure these off is i'm going to just put on the ground this is roughly the center line. And i'm going to just drill this [music] yeah all right there we go. So what i'm doing here is i'm just establishing my low point. And i'll do the same thing on the other side all right there we go. Now we have the height of our windows established we have a rough idea where our centerline is. Now what we need to do,https://youtu.be/o1PayLsEg3A?t=65,"['What are the two approaches to sticking in a window?', 'How does one approach involve putting the top of the window casing and door casing in a straight line?', 'Why would you put a long board across the top of the shed for this design?', 'How did the author establish their low point on the ground?', 'What is the purpose of establishing the centerline of the shed?']"

Now what we need to do is measure how big a hole we're actually cutting here. So this window is actually 36. And a quarter top-to-bottom. So we're gonna go like this 36. And we'll go 1/2 at the bottom of the hole just. So we have a little flexibility to make sure they're balanced out there's the top of my window. And i'll put a hole there as well cuz the idea here is i want to trace my hole for my window on the other side of the wall. And then cut it from back there. So i just want to get a couple of these holes to identify where my stopping lines are because as long as i'm on the outside i can't tell exactly where my centerline is this is just a rough to me for. Now ok there we go. And let's do the other side all right. Now the trick with these little windows here guys is the the outside flange it actually is just a little bit too big to fit inside this cavity. But the inside of this flange will have no problem at all all right. So what we want to do is we want to measure off. And cut this line somewhat level somewhat because the goal here since i have a fully enjoying goal here is to cut the size of this window out. And then put a piece of 2x4 pressure-treated lumber in slide it over lapping the outside board. And then we'll stick the window in the hole it's not that much rocket science involved here because we have. So much mercy i'm not even going to bother measuring i'm just gonna cut no because my window was actually 12. And a quarter. And my gap is 14. And a half i have call it two inches. So have an extra space. So yeah i'm gonna just do this that represents my one inch gap on each side yeah twelve in my corner. So i'm gonna cut on the outside of those. Now i can't use the skill saw here unless i drill the four corners out. Then i can cut from the other side. And that is what i'm going to do because using the reciprocate or in this situation really is frustrating. And slow. And tedious. So let's drill our four corners. Now wow that is really noisy all right. Now i got my safety gear on time to get some work done wait a minute i can't see a damn thing with all this safety gear on alright just having a little fun man we get enough safety trolls in the comments tell you what is this world coming to. Now i'm gonna just draw this line get old-fashioned way do [applause] [music] [applause]. Now i've just thought i'd point this out what i'm doing here is i'm lining it up i know everything's square. And level that includes all these lines on the shed. So i just start. And i find a mark on my guard here that lines up for something that's pre-existing. And then i just keep that line straight makes this really quite simple yeah that's a whole how we gonna do. Now is do the same thing with the other side [music] a little violent. But it worked yay oh. Now all i really want to do here folks is just check to see if they're about the same distance off the ground from the line that i cut. And if it is. Then i'm in great shape six. And a quarter i know i'm not gonna risk it there we go two two two seventy six. And a quarter i don't have that millimeters for you. But maybe one of these days i'll buy a new tape where i can have both measurements it might be more handy there's some of our viewers overseas i am just gonna cut a couple pieces of wood here we're at the bottom of the window is gonna go that'll assist me in sealing it up nice. And tight i'm still using this technique i don't care what people say on the internet there's nothing that's not safe about this this does not kick back if you keep your blade square folks kickback happens when you twist the blade. Then it runs backwards never kicks back when you're keeping a square you know what. And to be honest with you if you're concerned about kickback on a skill saw maybe you shouldn't be using the tool if you can't hold it. And keep it from kicking back i wouldn't pick it up in the first place [music] just wanted to go to real quick because it's a shed we don't have too much concern about a whole lot of thing is one of them being water penetration everything that we're doing as far as a finishing technique is going to get an,https://youtu.be/o1PayLsEg3A?t=183,"['What is the size of the hole cut for the window?', 'How do you measure the gap between the window and the wall?', 'Why is it important to keep the blade square when using a skill saw?', 'Can you use a reciprocating saw to cut through the flange?', 'How does the author ensure that the window is level during installation?']"

And it's a polyurethane sealant which is gonna be bonding awesome with all the different wood products. And plastic products we have here. So that's why we're using it i'm already planning on using a polyurethane exterior sealant. So i'm not thinking that it's necessary to wrap everything this is not a new house i expect the last two or three four hundred years i just want to get 40 years out of a decent shed. So the window is front-heavy. And it'll keep wanting to fall out on you. So just push it into the one corner all the resistance up against that cut lumber it's not going anywhere thank god i made it inside before it fell on the ground. Now we're gonna just center it in the hole because this is designed to be centered with this construction remember back when we frame the building we measured from the center of the of this wall to this stud. So what i want to do is i'm gonna have this perfectly centered in this in this cavity. And we'll do the same with the other window. Now to keep this from moving around on us i just want to get one screw in here no it can't fall out. And even if it wants to yeah that's good enough for. Now the other thing we can do. Now we can pull it forward. And drill one in there yeah. And these three screws will keep this in place until we get our exterior sealant on once that sealants on this windows not going anywhere window number two windows are done. So the main door as we all know we changed our design to go from a barn door which you know sounded sexy in the beginning. But let's face it the more we thought about what we realized it's not not very functional in high winds. And wintertime with animals with everything it's just it's not gonna work. So it's just the wrong choice for the shed. So we actually have this framed as a 32 inch interior hole. So that we could put a 34 or 36 door on the outside originally. But we actually have an actual 32 inch door. Now so this hole is too small it doesn't allow for the operation. And we need to have at least an eighth of an inch on each side in order to do that. Now half we head nailed this frame together we could mark on our plate take out our sledgehammer. And just beat this over. And those nails that were in there would actually bend. And allow that wood to pass over. And then we could just tighten it down. And be fine. But we use screws. So now i've got actually cut this plate out where the screws are. And then reinstall a new plate with new studs. So that works for me what i am gonna do is i'm gonna measure because i'm gonna use these studs over i'm gonna measure eighth of an inch just gonna mark mark mark just a little bit to the side of where this stud is. Now okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna cut these loose we're gonna install this stud. So that this edge here is in line with that. And then i'll put in a new pressure-treated 2x4 that'll double it up we'll reverse the the natural bow in the wood. So it stays nice. And straight. And then we'll be able to install our door directly to that once we're done that will cut out the plate. And we'll start hinge in our door. So hopefully this goes really simple here we go. And the way that you get the maximum amount of effect here is by pushing this plate up against the wood okay if your sawzall is loose. Then the blade will catch things. And then your your machine will bounce back. And forth the blade isn't moving. But if you keep that's why there's such a big solid piece of steel if you keep that pressed against something. And the blades doing all the work generally screws they have a weaker shear strength than a nail. So cutting off the top isn't necessary we should be able to just wiggle these back. And forth. And they'll break loose from the screws on top all right. So we're gonna hammer the sheathing. And what that does is it pulls the nail out. And if you hit the sheathing just under the nail it'll put the sheathing back sliding against the nail on the shaft shaft of the nail sorry exposing the head. And then you can just use the claw to pull it in. So let's see if this works. Now here we go left. And right. And there we go. And now,https://youtu.be/o1PayLsEg3A?t=566,"['What type of sealant is being used for exterior finishing?', 'Why was a new design chosen for the main door?', 'How did the decision to change from a barn door to a different design come about?', 'What is the purpose of measuring eighth of an inch on each side when installing a door?', 'What happens if you hit the sheathing just under a nail while hammering it in?']"

Now here we go left. And right. And there we go. And now we're gonna demonstrate the weakness of the screw in the shear strength we're gonna show you here i got my black marker. Now on that stud man did it do. And is perfect [applause]. So here's the option that we have if this is the outside of my building alright. And this represents my my door stud i have this stuff exposed all the time because i'm not going to be installing a jamb system here that to me is just a whole lot of extra work. And it's not necessary. But if i have this stud. And then i cut this board flush to that. And then i have this if this was the other side of the shed just assume my pressure-treated is sitting a little proud here. So it's flush. Then when i put on my casing i have weatherproof material on all sides. And i'm not gonna have the sheathing exposed to the elements as they sneak in between the door during rainstorms. And stuff. So this is what we're gonna do we're actually going to cut the sheathing at this point all right. And then install our jacks cuz this is the king this will be the jack of course it'll be longer i'll cut them fresh. But we'll put our header pronounced. And i've put our jacks pronounced. And then we will install our door on that i think we'll get a much better result i think i'm gonna make this mention in the video here if you're going to build the shed. And you're gonna use this design as your blueprint. And you're putting in the door like we are. And you want to follow the system let's just map this out our door is 32 by 80 inches that means we want to have probably a half an inch at the ground. So we can put in some sort of a sweeper. So that takes it to 80. And a half. And then you want a quarter inch until your let's call it our jam that's 80. And three-quarters okay all right no kidding three quarters is until your header okay. So mark 80. And 3/4 that's the beginning of the header your header is gonna be inch. And a half okay. And so. Then that'll go all the way across your space. And then afterwards we're gonna put a one by three pressure treated casing. Then we're gonna custom-make out of our deck boards. And then that'll close the gap. And get a nice seal on the top. So if you're making this at home just remind yourself 83 any quarters the door hole okay. And then you're gonna have a two by four header. And then we're gonna use the trim to get up to contact with the surface. And then seal it what they're probably you're think that'll give us a pretty good forty year door all right. Now now we're done we're just cutting i'll take a little off there it's not gonna hurt one of the beautiful things about a nice new sawzall blade is that it's nice. And sharp on the tip if it gets bent while you're using it just use the cloth. And hammer straighten it it was what we're gonna do is we're just going to rest it here. And you'll see the extension that it goes out. And comes back in is about an inch. And a half. So if you're gonna plunge cut which is what this is be careful don't start at the corner you might go too high. And then you'll have a nasty mess outside it's easier to start somewhere where it's comfortable where you can see. And then we can cut down. And then cut back up okay that's crazy the other technique is user skill saw set the depth on your blade to that of your material plus a little bit don't list it doesn't matter if you cut into your stud a little bit here that'll be fine. And then like i said since this is all pretty much square. And level. And we're gonna be going with the casing we can mark this where our cut is. So i'm just putting that black mark on the saw there. So it's easier to see pull back the guard set my black mark on my material [music] well that's a lot easier [music] [music] [music] huh well that worked doesn't seem like the greatest technique if you got better idea let me know. Now it's time to cut the play-doh this was great when we were building our said keeping everything square. And level. But now that it's been attached to the concrete we don't need the plate anymore tada. And the answer to the question no i can't use that plate as the header because the sawzall actually takes about 1/8 of an inch off each side. So now it's a full quarter short. So i'm going to measure this 135. And 7/8 sweet [music] all right. So so 80. And 3/4 here we go.

So so 80. And 3/4 here we go. And these are my jack studs the reason they're called jack studs is because jack's hold things up this is what you didn't rest the header on i know a lot of people think that it's like something to do with a deck of cards. But never heard of a queen stud before perfect. Now what you want to do here let's take a look down your wood okay you'll see this board it's got a little bit of a curve to it all right. So i'm taking that curve. And i'm gonna install it against the wall. So that curves into the door all right you see that there. And i'm gonna screw through the face tie everything together. And that'll help keep that wood to here nice. And straight the other thing we're gonna do is we're gonna pull this forward flush off the building brush there it's getting a bit of a warp. And a couple different spots let's start here when the moment if you laid it it's kind of nice not working in that 40 degree heating. Now this board of course he's got some twists. And turns in it a little bit more up there okay that was actually pretty straight let's get our factory edges right on the concrete. Now we saw the header.

Now we got plenty of room up top we're gonna have about a half inch on the bottom when we're done. And we have about a half inch overall dealing with this. But yeah right here.

And picked up a couple of gate kits for they're both the same this one the one on the other side we're gonna finish this off in some grays. And blacks. And kind of dark tones very modern look. So we figured we'd get the black hardware it'll work out well. Now this is all surface mounted. So it mounts on the surface the door. And then the surface that is mounting on should be flush with the outside of the door trick right because right. Now this is a little bit too ugly to mount to anything on remember our intention here was to come back. And put a casing on this that's also pressure treated. So having said all of that also really nice decorative big handles. So what we're gonna use for our casings is our deck. Now these are one-inch-thick five. And a half inch wide actual dimension. So what we're going to do is we're going to rip down our boards at three. And a quarter inches. And then the balance of that is two. And a quarter. So that when we put them together on the outside of our walls two. And a quarter sorry the three. And a quarter is board. And the two. And a quarter here the the dimension to the outside corner is three. And a quarter on both pieces that's really simple to do. So we're going to use that as our as our template for all of the trims. And moldings here. So we'll have some two. And a quarter across the top to close off the gap. And around our door we're gonna use three. And a quarter inch molding nice. And fat. And it's going to do a great job. So because this is kind of finished carpentry we're gonna change the blade on our saw. And i love this saw for this reason it's.

And i love this saw for this reason it's. So easy to change the blade all i do is i push down this little spot here bring the guard forward make sure it's not plugged in of course this is crazy this plugged in put the wrench on it's already hidden in the handle loosen that. And then you just take it off with your fingertips there are a lot of designs of saws out there that are not this handy or they come with a wrench. But they don't have a place to store it in the tool. And end up losing it i've done that a thousand times okay. And we're gonna switch that blade out. Now that one was a really fine tooth blade i think it was a sixty tooth i've been using it for a long time for everything. And it has just about worn out as usefulness. So when you want something done. And the finished look is oh. So important best to just get a new blade 15 or 20 bucks goes a long way. And the same thing if you have the guard on you can't grab the nut you have the guard off you expose the teeth that's why i suggest ah there you go get that back where you aren't gonna lose it.

And then off we go. Now just a suggestion save your old blades sometimes these come in really handy if you have a hole in the floor when you're building something you can use this as a plate protector against electrical or plumbing lines alright. So here's my five quarter board alright what i've done is i've just put a sheet of plywood down on my little bench saw mike's bench ladder. And i'm gonna overhang this stuff really extremely long. And i'm going to just screw it in place in a few spots the idea here is to screw this in place. So that going to both to my hands-free to do the cutting of course if you have a table saw go ahead. And use it yeah what if you don't well you do it is you set up three. And a quarter that's three in a quarter i'm gonna put my thumb there i'm gonna run my index finger right next to it okay. And i'm gonna use my index finger as my guide we're lined up we're gonna cut this off at three. And a quarter. And then the remainder is screwed to this table with my lumber on it it's not going to go anywhere this is perfectly safe in most countries in the world [music]. Now using the screws to hold this down isn't gonna hurt anything we're gonna be using the same fasteners to install the trim boards later anyway. So now we got our two pieces cut down. And just for aesthetics we're gonna set it back you know eighth to a quarter just have a nice little edge there. And we're gonna put one screw into the jack. And one into the king keep it all nice. And tight okay. So jack. And king jack. And king every 20 inches or. So it sets me up with about four screws. Now we have a pressure-treated casing weatherproof a pressure-treated jack weatherproof a solid wood door polyurethane over. And over. And over again where the roof we got a shed door system it's gonna last a long long long time. And i believe we're even going to paint this thing man old man. So we just got back from lunch hello.

And see what they were offering. And sure enough you know he's got the same exterior wall board. And most of the frame work on the back wall in the front wall in the shed that was similar to this one it was two by four. But it's 24 inch on center not 16. And the roof it was two by four the rest of the framing was like a kite just a couple of sticks two by threes everything's designed to kind of get nailed together if you haven't had the opportunity to look at this video yet there's one online with a guy actually assembling the kit from the hardware store remember watching the video going wow that doesn't look very solid in person it's actually scary there is not too many places on earth where i would expect that to last more than a few years without getting blown away.

But all of the frame work is just regular spruce there's not it. And there's no pressure-treated anywhere there's all kinds of exposed pine there's just areas all over the place where it's gonna just rot rot rot rot rot you know they look cute from this street right. But for the price you can build this thing that's like 1,500 bucks all in including the pad or you can go buy a really cheap kite shed for a little bit more than that. And then you have to follow the instructions. And hopefully everything that's pre-cut. And ready to be assembled. And then there's no structure to it you can't actually hang anything off the walls - i'll just buy a tarp. So the secret to doing this kind of a door frame. And lets me feel whenever you're doing pressure-treated lumber finishing trims every time you make a cut it's got to be bigger than what you need okay this stuff has a tendency to dry. And it's going to get a little smaller. So what i like to do is measure the outside i'm 39. And 3/4. So we're gonna do is we're going to cut a different design. So you're gonna draw a little demonstration here here's a door okay. And here's my casing right okay there we go free hand loving it here across the top i want to go past the outside edge okay almost like a little bit of an asian influence with that kind of a finished look all right because when everything starts to dry you want that overhang if you cut it square or try to miter it's gonna dry. And it's gonna look stupid forever. And ever. And ever. So if you go long on purpose don't just go square long okay that just shows a little lack of creativity put a little bit of an angle on it at least alright have a little bit of fun here i mean this is the main entrance gonna sexes up a little bit. And once you got your piece cut you know. Now they were dealing with finished trim it don't be afraid to pull out the same thing sponge i love these things they take the contour of anything you're sanding. And i'm not looking for making its really perfect i'm just looking to get some of these raw rough edges off because when i'm using a skill saw as a ripping saw it's not perfect. But nobody's gonna see that from my house [music]. Now initially we wanted a half-inch gap at the bottom i'm looking around to my amazement i don't have any half-inch material i have 3/8. So i got 5/8 i got 3/4. So i'm gonna start to three-eighths we're gonna just set the door in visually. And inspect. And see how we feel about this don't let it fall. And now we're using gate hardware here which is not manufactured perfectly because gates aren't perfect. So you don't have to just accept the fact that nothing is gonna be perfect here what you want to do is set up the middle of the cylinder right off the edge of the door. And then attach your screws okay that one's going in a bit of an angle big surprise. Now the way you solve this is by pre-drilling your holes or put the screw in reverse just start the hole all right there we go use a little resistance here all right. And then we want to square this off [music]. And that's just because these are such a coarse thread right having that on reverse burns the tip into the wood. So that it sets the hole straight in. And out even the one that ended up on an angle you can fix it by burning it in okay. So now we take the door stick it on our three-eighths. So now we have our airspace okay. So we're gonna start flush. And from here we're gonna eyeball i have. But a half an inch gap i want to split the difference. So what i'm gonna do take my door slide it over about a quarter. Now that i got my gap where i like it i'm gonna put my screw in the same thing you want to burn this in if you don't burn it in this would end up splitting because the three screws are about the same green spot that will make sure that these three screws this close together near the edge of the green won't end up cracking. And splitting off over time or you can pre-drill all your holes i just find this a whole lot easier [applause] release our panel when you use this nail here as a wedge. So i can open up it's a consistent gap across this well i'm drilling a hole. Now this little tool here is awesome i use this when i'm installing door handles. So that you don't you bring them burn the side of the handle you know how it gets thing those brush metal handles you get your drill bit on there it always rubs up its also make sure that the bit doesn't fall off the screw whoo nice. So because we have materials that expanding contract we can install this doorstop here that way you don't see the door when it's closed the gap way to get",https://youtu.be/o1PayLsEg3A?t=1881,"['What is the primary material used for the exterior paneling of a box kite shed?', 'Why is pressure-treated lumber not used in the construction of the frame?', 'How does the author ensure that the finished trim fits properly around the edges of the door?', 'What technique does the author use to prevent the gap between the door and the frame from splitting over time?', 'Why is it important to pre-drill holes when using gate hardware on a box kite shed?']"

And a half make your mark okay inch. And a half. Now because we're using surface mount of gate hardware we want the door in this case. And be perfectly flush. So i'm just gonna line this up on my mark there we go. Now i'll close the door. And what will happen here is if it's out of alignment just closing that door well straighten everything out okay. Now wherever its lands where i'll throw my screws. So we have two kinds of hardware here one is gonna be the latch okay. And the idea here is it sits there. And and the door will latch into it. And this will keep the door from opening by itself okay this is like wind control. And this is how you got something opening with. So we're gonna set this up based on these panels you know above this area i'm gonna set the latch off the middle of the door here. So the first thing is to get this attached know you have two screws you want to get them on your door. And have enough latch. So you can actually make contact usually leaves the front scrim pretty close to the front of the door this is one of the reasons why you want a solid wood door set your screw up there we go no burn that thing in backwards really important that screw goes in straight let's get this nice. And horizontal the danger here is a lot of times these screws are made of a softer metal. So pre drilling might not be a bad option if you don't have a great little gizmo like this all right what i'm gonna do with my black marker. Now is i'm gonna attach a door to this hardware. And line this up. Now you don't want it to the very far extent things might tend to move a little bit. So come in a little bit like this all right top. And bottom you see you don't have any mercy of there you can't go any higher split the difference okay bring it in nice. And tight. Now make your mark where all four holes go this time you got to be perfect start the hole with a nail in the direction that you want the screw to be driven okay on an angle towards the middle coming up or coming down this will help make sure this thing stays where you want it. And when you're driving your screws they'll go exactly where you want. And then won't be manipulated by the grain of the wood remember the phillips bit screw head as soon as the tip has any resistance because the head is the way it is it'll just bend on you to follow the resistance of the tip. So you really got to be planning in advance to make sure that you're gonna run into problems here get the hardware in place started to these screws before you finish driving them in because if anything isn't going the way you want you can manipulate the bracket by finishing off one of the screws. Now because they're going an angle as soon as one side of the screw makes contact with the plate stop screwing or you'll hear the head right off that's why the whole screw is black whoops a little too hard okay there we go. Now this handle comes with nut. And bolt assembly for going on like fence boards. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna buy a few screws that are hopefully already black if not we'll put them in some cardboard. And spray-paint them. But we're gonna mount this one here. And the same one on the other door wonderful thing about this latch its security because it has this little padlock thing here alright if you want to change out these little phillips screws with some really long screws you could okay. And then you can put a padlock on here they i don't know what else to say it's a door i think it's pretty i think it works yep it definitely works there you go an all-season outdoor shed door gotta love it while this video is getting a little bit too long.

And take a look at this. And i said, ""of course, that's not that difficult."" and they said, ""well, how in the world do you do that?"" because it's over the hole in the stairwell area. You can't lean over. And get it done. And the reality is, if you put a step ladder here. So that you can reach over to change that fixture, you run the risk of leaning over, having the step ladder fall the other way,. And then you fall through the stairwell. That could be quite an injury. So, i've got a trick. I developed a system, oh, i don't know, maybe 10 years ago. So, when i'm in someone's house painting in the stairwell, i don't have to use an extension pole. I just throw this rig together. I jump up there. And i make a temporary platform. And i'm going to show you how to do it. So, the way we do this is we have to create a platform which basically extends the floor from the top of the staircase directly underneath where the light is. That way, you can get out on top of this platform, put your ladder up,. And then it's a real easy procedure. And you don't run the risk of falling over. So, what we have to do is we just have to measure from where the floor is to the ceiling,. And it's about 8 ft. Transfer that line down. Threw a little bit of tape on the wall. Now, the reason i developed this for painting is because i needed a way to get in the platform to do the cut line without scratching the walls. So, here's the trick. What we do is we take our 2x6. And we're going to basically install this up against this wall without drilling into the wall. The idea here is we're going to have point load from here to the stairs. And here to the stairs. And that's going to transfer all the weight. And we're going to use joist hangers. We'll throw a few on. And. Then we'll just place some 2 by sixes in between where we are here. And over there. And. Then we can put a piece of cheap plywood on top. The whole thing costs about 30 bucks. Puts together in about 10 minutes. And. Then you're off to the races. So, i haven't had this engineered. So, if you do this at home, you're taking your life in your own risk. But what i've done is i'm just taking basic structure technology, how to do two-point loads,. And transfer that weight. 2x6 is enough. It's only over 7 ft,. So it's not a huge span. And so, basically, we're just going to not a whole lot of measuring going on here. All we want to do is make sure that the when we put a 2x6 in this cradle, it's not going to be rolling over. My pieces of wood. And here are my structural point loads. Just going to place them gently against the wall for now. And i'm going to slide a little bit of cardboard protection in behind. This is how i keep from scratching up the walls. All right, here we go. [music] now, this is really quite simple. [music] and. So you don't have to screw into the wall. I've got these little brackets. They're about a dollar. And i'm just going to connect these two pieces together. So this is something you can do alone. It's probably easier if you have a second pair of hands around to help you out. Okay. So. Now i've got my we'll call it a rim joist. And a couple of pieces of lumber here that are screwed together with a plate cardboard stapled on. It's not going anywhere. And. Now it gets really simple. I just take my 8ft piece of lumber. And bring it up. And through here. And. Then i just slide it back. And rest it into place. That seemed pretty easy. Now, the joist hangers have a little spot here where you screw in an angle that ties it together. So that it's not going to just fall apart on you. In this particular situation, it's probably better to fill all the holes. [music] i've got this one board left. Now, if you've never done this before. And you find it a little bit precarious, all you have to do is put this board here. And screw it down. Now, it'll hold the whole structure from sliding off the wall. There we go. Done. Now, this isn't going anywhere. And that'll carry a few thousand lbs. My wife says i'm a little overweight,. But i think i'll be fine. This piece of flooring that we're going to put on here is a just a piece of chipboard. It's basic subfloor you find in the hard hardware store. You can use the 5/8 version. I have 3/4 cuz that's what i'm matching up here for this renovation,. But the 5/8 would be fine. We just bring this down the stairs. [music] nice. And simple. Rest it into place. Done. Platform.

And if you're doing a floor tiling project in a bathroom you've probably come across this problem where you've got a toilet flanged in the floor that you need to kind of tile around. So we're going to deal with that exact topic in this video. So we've got a bit of a sample floor here that we've been shooting a few videos with. And we're just going to say that we've got a toilet flange here in the floor yours is going to be wherever this particular one ends up being you know out in the middle of a single tile you could have one where it's you know maybe it catches two or three tiles all at the same time though in that situation it's actually easier. But in our case we're going to need to cut a hole for that flange out of the basically the center of a tile. So the first thing really that i need to do is i need to find the center of the flange,https://youtu.be/T2zEggf6mYI?t=0,"['What type of tiles are commonly used for bathroom floor tiling?', 'How does one determine the location of a toilet flange in a floor?', 'Can a toilet flange be centered within a single tile?', 'What is the ideal situation when it comes to cutting around a toilet flange?', 'How do you find the center of a toilet flange in a floor for tiling purposes?']"

So i don't turn it i just know that the arrow i want facing away from me okay. So there's a couple different scenarios that you might have in most cases i like to be able to have the flange disconnected from below. So i can take it on. And off in your case your flange might be connected you can't get at it. And it could be already fastened to the floor. So in that case you want to actually cut your tile to fit the outside of that flange. And what i would do is just measure your flange in this case it's seven inches. So i'd want to make my actual hole about seven. And a quarter inches. So it gives you a little bit of breathing room around it. Then when you put your tile in. And go to grout you can grout that space it shouldn't show anyways your toilet should cover it. But and in that case.

And in that case. Then you're going to want to use a couple of wax rings because this flange is actually lower than it should be in that particular case the reason i like to have my flanges. So that they're removable. And i put it in after the tile is. So that it can sit up on the tile. And it gets a nice better seal to the toilet. So that's that's the way i'm going to show you how to do it really the only difference is is in the circumference of the hole. So in my case because i want the tile to sit up on the hole i need the hole in that tile to be slightly smaller than the whole  diameter of this. So we said this was seven inches it's got some screw locations in there. So just to make it easy i don't want to have to drill through the tile to put those screws in. So i need my tile just to come in you know about that much underneath the flange. And then this screwing through it won't be any problem. So looks like that if i come in about a quarter inch each way. So half inch total. So i'm gonna go instead of seven inches i'd go six. And a half. So i'll just use my  protractor here to draw a circle i'm,https://youtu.be/T2zEggf6mYI?t=169,"['What is the purpose of using wax rings with flanges?', 'Why do you need to adjust the hole diameter in the tile?', 'How much should the tile be lowered to accommodate screws?', 'What is the benefit of having removable flanges?', 'Why did you choose a smaller hole diameter than the full diameter of the flange?']"

And a quarter start at one i should have this set up before we were ready to go okay. So yeah. So that'd be three. And a quarter which will be six. And a half. So we've got our center location i'll just mark that be sure your point the point of your compass isn't  sliding around on you too much. So that you're pretty accurate okay. So there you can see that's the circumference or the diameter that we want to cut that tile at. So that we can put the tile in place. And then slip the flange over without it falling through. So what i like to do to cut that hole is i like to use an angle grinder with a tile cutting or a masonry type segmented saw blade in it okay. And i'm gonna obviously be using eye protection hearing protection. And and a mask for the dust  your grinder hopefully has a guard on it to be safer.

So basically what i'm going to do is turn the grinder on. And i'm going to score a line or a sorry score a mark all the way around on that line. Now i've got a little bit of leeway. But i basically want to stay pretty close to that this is going to create a fair bit of dust. And you know. So you might might even want a vacuum going or whatever to to suck up some of that dust. But i'm going to get my safety gear on okay. So you'll see  i'm just taking nice short little strokes i'm not pushing real hard i'm just going little by little. And i'll make enough passes till i finally cut right through the tile [music] [music] foreign [music] [music] [music]. So you can see i've gone all the way around basically followed my line that i had there. And just got the whole circle started if if we are really close to an edge here you know still in one tile. But maybe we're right over here by an edge more than likely it's going to break off right in here. So you might want to put a couple of relief cuts there knowing it's going to break if it's that close like say within half an inch of this hole it's going to be under the toilet anyways. But if you put a relief here it'll prevent the tile usually from breaking anywhere else like out here where it would be seen sticking out front of the toilet in this case we should be safe to just keep cutting that all the way around without breaking this. So i'll just keep going with that it takes a little bit of time just go nice. And slow if you try to force it you are probably going to break the tile or or you know slip. And cut yourself also  i'll kind of be using my knees a little bit just to stabilize the tile too. So it's not moving around [music] [applause] [music] [applause] okay. So you can see as i got further along there eventually  you can see that you've cut through the tile. So you just keep working your way around until you've got it all cut through. And your piece should drop out of there. So now we've got our hole cut right through the tile. And i've got my arrow remember that i put on there to let me know which direction i had to be. And i'm just going to set it basically in place first. And dry fit it make sure that this flange would sit down on there. And all my screws are going to miss the tile edge which it looks like it is i'm a little the hole in the tile is a little offset to my left. But that's still going to clear all the holes. So it would be fine. So from that point on. Then i would just simply install that tile like any other tile knowing that that's going to fit right the first time. And it'll sit up there nicely where it should be there's you notice my blade i think this is a five inch blade yeah measures four. And three quarters. But i think they call it a five inch a four inch blade is a little bit easier to deal with when cutting these smaller holes when you're turning you know trying to shave it around the corner. But the five inch does work as you see me just do. So so that's how i would cut a hole in a tile for a toilet flange hopefully it was helpful.

So like a lot of homeowners they've got old doors or you've got a damaged door. And you got to replace it. So if you go to the store to buy a new door it'll be an 80 inch tall in most cases. And if your hole is smaller than that you're gonna have to learn how to cut it down. So depending what's going on your house whether you're added multiple layers of flooring or you're gonna be like us. And we're adding a smaller door to access under the stairs it's a really simple process to cut down the door to get the exact height that you want. So we're going to show you the three easy steps to get this project done. And it'll make you look like a pro first of all you got to have your measurements. So what we're dealing with here is a hole that is about 39 inches tall. And we're gonna make our door one inch shorter than the overall gap. So that'll make sure that there's gonna be lots of room around for us to do the install that work into hard,https://youtu.be/iSLiWCgCATE?t=24,"['What is the typical height of a standard door?', 'Why would you need to cut down a door to fit a smaller hole?', 'How many layers of flooring are typically added in a house?', 'What is the purpose of making the door one inch shorter than the overall gap?', 'What type of work will be done into the hard space around the new door installation?']"

So i'll transfer that information on to our door slab 39 inches. And to keep it simple what i do is i'll just mark both sides i'll take a scrap piece of wood here. And i'll lay it across the two marks. And then draw the line okay. And that's simple. Now in this situation it's almost half a door it's gonna be awkward to work with. So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to actually first of all i'm going to take off about a four inch piece here because the important aspect of this door is it has a core installed in the bottom. And if you just cut it down. And stick it in the hole. Then you're gonna have a huge open space in there for all kinds of critters to make homes. And it's gonna be nasty long term. So again you want to cut straight because it's easy on the blade. And then we're gonna cut the door down again about this size that'll make it more manageable. So here we go first we're going to save the bottom part of the core [applause] always important to cut all the way through. So even having nope there we go first of all i guess we should always adjust the depth of the blade. So it'll cut through the whole door that works a lot better. Now cut off a little bit the excess to make it manageable [music] you can see that's how the inside of the door is made which is why it's. So important to be able to close that up again that's why we save the bottom of the door we're actually gonna salvage the core. And then reinstall it into the new hole. But first. So first we're gonna protect the surface of the door. And potential scratches i throw in a couple pieces of tape on here this is just your basic painters tape no i've had heard people say in the comments oh i just taped the bottom of the saw right. So they taped the saw plate here i don't like to do that because i don't want adhesives residue on my saw when i'm working i'd like to know them i saw is going to slide without getting any kind of issue. And then we will. Now line that up some cutting clear if i tie up my table okay here we go [music],https://youtu.be/iSLiWCgCATE?t=70,"['What type of material was used for the door slab?', 'Why did you need to cut off a 4-inch piece from the bottom of the door?', 'How do you prevent scratches on the surface of the door during cutting?', 'What is the purpose of saving the bottom part of the core?', 'Why is it important to adjust the depth of the blade when cutting through the door?']"

So what i do is i just stick my hammer in there. And i give it a twist. And it forces the cardboard panels to come apart all right there we go. Now i'm gonna continue to wrestle with this. And while i do if you haven't yet feel free to click the subscribe button you can feel free to give us a thumbs up if you like this kind of video we like to hear from your viewers you know what they like. And what they don't like. Now you can see they install this kind of stuff with adhesive which is a real bit of a frustration. But you're gonna cut down your door more than that one inch you're not gonna have a core left anymore. So always good to know how to remove all this junk once you've got it all taken off to the top you can take a look this side the hard board came off pretty clean there's not much left. But over here i got a lot of hardboard left. So what you're gonna want to do is take your knife. And cutting away from you almost like a chisel take all that excess hardboard off because you don't want to install a core into a door if it's too thick ok we're back let's clean this up just a little bit before we move forward. Now in most doors these hollow doors you have this little piece here it's kind of like a compressed wood sawdust feller. And there's usually about a foot long roughly where the middle of the door is. So that when you go to install your door handle you've got something there there's got some density to it. So that you're not going to rip the door handle right through the particle board later on since we cut into that we're actually gonna have to measure from here to here. And then install our little piece of filler. But before we do that we have to also remove these little extra pieces of cardboard that are in the way. And that's just a matter of getting in that glue line with a chisel or hiding a little red bar like this. And break in that glue joint. And if anybody is thinking wow they make doors like crap nowadays you just got to remember this all happened because we were trying to save trees. And recycle the paper. And this is one of the solutions they came up with. Now at the end of the day the door works fine they just don't have a lot of integrity. So if you're in a habit of punching your doors. And that sort of thing they hurt gonna last very long okay. Now let's get our measurement 16 out of 8 16.

And prepped the core cut it the size step three obviously is glue it all in place yeah you got a couple of options here you can put glue right on the core. But when you push it in it'll all leak out all over the door or you can just put it right inside the panel itself near the top put a nice healthy bead on both sides. So that when you put your door core in you're maximizing your contact with the glue okay the secret here is to tap with the hammer half-off is mix contact with the with the outside of the door. And then you don't risk hitting it too deep all right the only other thing you could do is if you have clamps if you have clamps you can put a couple of compression clamps on there what i like to do is i just get a little bit more creative throw a little bit of tape you'd be surprised how much strength is it a piece of tape done let that sit for about 20 minutes we're ready to hang.

Now because this door is. So small. And it's just made for access under the stairs we're gonna use the piano hinge to install it. And i'm probably gonna install just a regular kind of door cabinet door handle on it it seems to make a little bit of sense. So we'll put that aside for. Now but i wanted to show you is if your door is a little bit too wide for your your gap the reason i'm covering this information is because a lot of people are changed on the doors out in older homes. And there are different size widths of the door than they are. Now this is what we do in construction we constantly change the norms. So everytime you want to repair or fix something you have to buy something brand new you can't just buy something. And stick it in you have to go do some elaborate expense right. So i'm going to show you the secret. And this is what we call a planer it's a hand planer it's a very portable tool. And what this does is it can cut down you just adjust your dial for the thickness that you want to remove. And this is how we do this. So you will see that in this door the inside of the door is not as wide as the outside of the door this is on a bit of a slope that's. So that when you're closing the door it doesn't make contact with the jamb. But it finishes nice. And tight okay. So you're on a bit of a slope. Now if you find that you're installing your door. And your slab is just a little bit too wide there's not enough forgiveness sometimes it's because the age of the home okay sometimes it's because the layers of paint that are on the door jamb. So what you do is you put your door into your hole. And you would scribe the thickness that you want to get rid of. And that's the thickness you want to get rid of. And the way we do that is we use the planer this sucker spins really fast. And it has one three-inch blade that rotates a few thousand times a minute. And if it touches any part of your body it will remove it. So having said that hold the plate flat to the door that you're cutting all right not in an angle or you're gonna mess up the bevel. And you just turn it on. And then in one pass you just go right across the door. And if you haven't removed all your pencil do it again [music] tada. And that is how you would cut down a door to make it a little bit center all you have to do to finish that is just take a little bit of a sanding bar or a orbital sander give it a quick pass. And you have got a customized door okay well it's been 20 minutes this core is firmly in place. And we are ready to install this door. So now i got to go get this door installed on this little play structure if you like to see how this project turns out click the link at the end of the video [music],https://youtu.be/iSLiWCgCATE?t=520,"['What is a planer used for in construction?', 'How does a planer cut down a door?', 'Why do some doors need to be customized?', 'Can a planer remove too much material from a door?', 'What is the purpose of using a piano hinge on a small door?']"

So you know in the case where you're attaching  you know basement walls or some kind of framing to a concrete pad  there's a few different options i'm going to show you some different anchors i think i've got four here four different styles to show you today. And so i'll talk about them a little bit to start with. And then i'll actually demonstrate installing them. So because they're all going into concrete you know we'd be fastening something like this product 2x4 down to concrete. So you're going to need a rotary hammer drill. And you're going to need the appropriate size masonary bit for that drill for the size of anchor you're using. So i've got here i'll just get the bits out of the way i've got here the  the different anchors that are more common this one is about the  simplest style. And basically it's a a metal shank you can see it's got a little bit of a an arch in that end there. And the idea behind that is is once you drill through your wood plate down into the concrete floor. Then you hammer this into that spot. And this little  bend in that  in that shank is what really friction fits you into the hole w. So really simple fairly inexpensive. And does a good job. So that's one anchor  another type of anchor is this sleeve plastic sleeve type type of anchor. And basically same idea you drill,https://youtu.be/evo3IWwEt-g?t=0,"['What are some common options for attaching wood to concrete?', 'What tools do I need to attach wood to concrete?', 'How do the different anchors work in relation to the concrete?', 'What is the purpose of a rotary hammer drill when attaching wood to concrete?', 'Why would I choose one type of anchor over another for attaching wood to concrete?']"

And basically same idea you drill through your wood product down into the concrete  you you pull the plastic anchor out the insert i should say hammer it down into your hole. Then insert the anchor. And hammer it in as well the one feature with this this particular one  is that if you can see here on the end it actually has a  this one has a phillips end on it. So the idea behind this is you could actually unscrew this. And remove that board if you ever had to  what i've found myself using these is a lot of times you that doesn't really happen as easy as it looks. But it is made to to function that way if you had to remove something maybe the odd time or whatever you might want that type of an anchor  this anchor here little more heavy duty  all these come in different sizes by the way these ones especially i mean you can get these half or 3/4 inch in diameter all different lengths these these ones here are heavier. And would be more for attaching  framing to concrete like say garage walls or shed wall or something that's going to be very permanent. And you need it very strong. And again a lot like the other anchors you're going to drill a hole,https://youtu.be/evo3IWwEt-g?t=104,"['What is the primary purpose of a plastic anchor?', 'How does a Phillips-end plastic anchor differ from its non-Phillips end counterpart?', 'What type of projects are these heavy-duty plastic anchors typically used for?', 'Can you remove a board that has been attached with a plastic anchor using the screw on the end?', 'What factors determine the size and weight capacity of different types of plastic anchors?']"

And again a lot like the other anchors you're going to drill a hole through the wood into the concrete you are going to insert this in there with your nut. And washer on it. So you insert it. And then you hit this with the hammer. And as it goes down into the hole. And bottoms out in the bottom of the concrete hole what it does is actually pushes this wedge against this collar that's here which makes it all expand. And that gives it the friction that it needs to not pullo. And then you simply take a wrench or a ratchet or whatever tighten this nut down to hold your plate snug to to the surface. So that's that style again those would be more for  a heavier application  more on the little bit lighter duty side we've got this product here  same same idea these ones are a little short obviously for attaching this. But you can get them longer. And same idea you drill your hole through there this one's got either a nut driver type head or a screwdriver head. So then you use your  you know cordless drill or whatever. And attach it right into the concrete  they're kind of a hardened hardened  screw type thread on there. So it just bites right into the concrete  a lot of people like those  i prefer this one for you know with just basement walls or that that sort of thing it's just simple it's easy  the only drawback to this one is it doesn't pull out very easy if you make a mistake you pretty much have to  cut it off or break it off. So okay. So i'm going to reposition down on the floor  to where i've got a piece of wall plate in this basement. And i'm going to use a couple three of these different ones just to show you exactly how they do function okay. So the first anchor i'm going to use is this  real simple curved shank one.

So you can see that that one  we've got it hammered in got it hammered right down there nice. And tight. So we're good. Now i'll just change bits. And move down to the next style okay. So the next one will be this one with the plastic sleeve on [music] [applause] [music] it. So you take the sleeve off just tap it down into the hole insert the metal screw type anchor same thing we just hammer it in nice. And tight. And flush.

And we're going to drill the hole insert it. And hammer it in. Then tighten it [applause] up okay. So the key on these ones make sure you've got your washer. And you're not already on there because once you drive this with your hammer it usually mushrooms the end of it a bit. And and you can't generally get the nut started on there. So always have it on there ahead of time insert it into the hole there you can feel you can hear that it bottomed out in the hole give it a couple more wraps like. So so i just snug that down by hand. And i'll just tighten this nut up. And it'll draw the the wood right down nice. And tight to the concrete just like that. So we've got our washer right down it's starting to compress into the wood  we're good. And tight  the other style that i have i don't have a long enough one. So there's no point in showing you because it would barely even go through the wood basically same idea drill your hole insert the anchor. And then that one use a drill or yeah a drill to  drive it down into the concrete. So you know there's four different different ways for attaching  you can also add to any one of these some adhesive of some kind to the bottom side  i don't think there's too much more i can say.

Now usually you're gonna find this of you on a new home you've got a rough-in bath. And you don't know how to finish it today's video we're going to talk about how to do it without having to open up the concrete because there is technology on the market that allows you to finish off your room without rearrange. And we're all the locations of the plumbing are if you're a little creative. So let's just dive right in by roughing plumbing i mean that we've got a toilet stack okay usually a 3-inch pipe coming out of the ground. And in the back in the shower i've got a one. And a half you might have a two-inch pipe coming out of the ground. And they just have caps on them. So the first thing we got to do is we've got to cut them up.

Now the toilet we want to cut exactly flush with the concrete because whatever flooring you go back with if you fix your flange. Now you're going to have a perfect set height for the toilet to rest on top of that flange without having any leaking weight to put the toilet flange on after your flooring you run the risk of it having holding the toilet off the floor too much. And not getting a good see you later. So the purpose of the cut i'm just using a simple little hand tool it's an abs saw. And it's very flexible. So i can actually bend the bleed. And cut flush up the floor i've done most of this work off-camera because it is work [music] [music] nice at the hardware store they're gonna sell the toilet flange. And this is designed to go inside the pipe okay. Now you'll notice it's a pretty snug fit what i did is i actually took my grinder wheel. And i just ran up some lines down this just to help thin out the plastic a little bit because it was. So tight there's no way that i can force it in the pipe when it's buried in cement. So that was very important. So i'm just gonna take my glue.

And you just put it install it with a bit of a slope for the water to drain the right direction that's all we need for that. So when you cut the pipe out of the ground for this for the drain for the shower make sure you leave about a half an inch maybe three-quarters of an inch of the stub. So you can attach a fitting. And then your drain can go anywhere. Now it works in combination with a couple of other elements to create an actual floor we'll get to that in a minute. But if you like keeping things simple. And you want to build your own shower i'm going to suggest the schluter board product is really handy for this you know in the past we've done videos we've showed you a lot of different systems for doing a shower. But the schluter board system is the most versatile. And it is a waterproofing system as well not just water diversion system like most showers okay. And they have these cute little washer. And clip systems. And they're designed to create compression on their own half inch polystyrene all right that's how you install it instead of screws. And the idea here is you install all these screws. And washers that gives you a nice rigid wall. But you can tile over because. Then this cloth is actually a waterproofing cloth. So the schluter system comes with a kerb. And you set that in cement on your on your concrete it also has tape that like a cloth tape that you can put in the corners to make all your joints seal. And after it on our pan it actually even has a cloth you can put over top of here your pre sloped pan we're gonna build today ourselves. And it comes with bunch of other little attachments here this is for your inside. And outside corners. And you can put all that product together to create a perfectly waterproof shower. So the way that we're gonna do it it's just demonstrate real quickly how to get all this installed oh there is my bushing we're just gonna take our thin set right here in on the floor. Now this material here is actually designed as a rigid base okay we're going to install our dream with the,https://youtu.be/OIcVcJvUadc?t=191,"['What type of product does Schluter offer for shower installation?', 'How does the Schluter drain system work?', 'What is the purpose of leaving a half inch or three-quarters of an inch stub when installing a pipe for a shower drain?', 'Can you build your own shower using only the Schluter board product?', 'What are some other elements that the Schluter board system works in combination with to create a floor?']"

And then add a little bit of sand mix to fill up around all the plumbing. So we don't to be void. So it's structurally sound we're going to use the sand mix. And push it towards the corners. And create a little slow. So we have a nice drain going to the mill. So the way the plumbing would go together in this situation you just take your elbow. And use a little bit of pipe here same with the fishing. And the other end okay i'm gonna set that in place here we go right. So next step. Now that we have our drain installed. And our material here we got to fill the gaps using the sand mix yeah you want to just kind of try to pour that right in where you want it it has a good flow ability. So the same reason that we're using this stuff because of its flow ability it's the same reason that means you have to put blocking behind your shower. And just run all over your whole basement work that into all of these cracks.

Now we're gonna use to create a slope. Now instead of using sand mix you could use a product called dry pack. And that is a more traditional tile bed product. But it's not available in most hardware stores. So that's why i'm using the sand mix just to demonstrate the products that are available in any hardware store near you. And that product here is actually something silly like 67 bucks very affordable it is gonna take overnight to set up however. So be prepared for that or your schedule here we go you can see at the beginning or a shower bed what we need. Now is a little bit more. So i can go from this edge here up to about a half an inch thickness on on each four corners that's it when we use a smaller tile sometimes i got four by four on the floor can't get the last piece of wall on install over the clips do the tape like i said.

And i'll just rake it back a little bit set it in place. And if you want you can use a level. But generally speaking you can do this by eye it's not hard put a trowel here that creates a nice level surface right beautiful okay. So after done with all your sand mix get this take some of this cloth you'll cut it to fit. And then that'll be it for the next day we'll actually have to install that with fin set.

0.0,1476.0,Basements,PLh0KqGKtX4oWUr5nKO6U9y-otNi6OA0ud,How To Frame  A Bulkhead,XqPOOcvsm4Y,How To Frame  A Bulkhead: What is a bulkhead in framing?,c4a625ff-ea17-3b2e-06f1-8be9262a1619,Hi i'm shannon from host improvements.com in this video i'm going to show you how to  frame in a bulkhead around some duct work in the ceiling of this basement  bulkheads are used to cover in variety of things. But usually duct work or plumbing are the main sorts of things that you'd need to  cover up. So we're basically building a framework that we can drywall. And finish. And hide away all the ugliness of whatever we're trying to cover up. So like i said we've got two  rectangular ducks running side by side in this case. So we're just going to create one large bulkhead to cover them both up in one shot i've gone ahead. And started  over here on this side already i've basically got things finished up. So we'll  just do a bit of a walkr on that. But the main part of the video will be just showing you how to do the other side. And finish off the bottom. So every scenario is a little bit different in this case i'm using a combination of a few different materials i'm using piece of metal stud track right here. So that's just the track that's used for metal studing. And i'm using a piece of utility right angle metal channel. And then i'm also throwing in some  2x4s. And i will be using some 1x4s as well  every situation's a little different. But because of because of all the different things i've got in the way up here it's kind of difficult to get a you know some framing in that's attached to the joist really easily like slid up in here. So normally what i would typically do is i would cut 2x4s to the right length slide them right up in here. And nail them in every joist. And have the bottoms all line up. And then just come along. And nail a 2x4 or 2 x two to the bottom of them like i said in this case it was there was just too much going on it was difficult to do. So what i did is attach this once i determin my distance i wanted or my my shape i marked some lines. And then i cut. And attached this piece of l-shaped metal on there. And it's kind of nice because it gives you a little extra freedom to get it in behind it. And screw into it easily you know i'm not if it was a piece of wood nailed up there. And i'm trying to nail down through it or anything it's just more difficult this makes it a little simpler the same thing with the track the nice thing with it is the 2x4 fits right inside of it i can simply use a little wafer screw like you see right there to do all the attachment. And even on the ends i just cut  cut down like that on both sides. And then bent it. And ran it up the sides. And up the end this end  there was a piece of wood there anyways. But and. Then i just simply cut blocks they didn't have to be exact length i just put them up tight up into that channel up there. And then i have a laser level set up across the room that's shooting in the the height that i wanted here to the bottom. So then  once these were all hanging i just simply went along. And adjusted that track piece up. And down to where it lined up with the laser level. And zapped in a a screw on each side  in the in the center because of the width of this this is pretty much going to be 4t wide. So in the center i thought i better put in some support here as well. So what's going to really happen is there's going to be 1x4s sitting in the two tracks like this there'll be another track over here that we'll get to in a few minutes. But this here is just shot in at a level. So that i can attach this here. And it supports the weight down the center of the  the two  duct work pieces i'm trying to allow ideally i like to allow about a half an inch at least clearance below the ducts. And one thing to check with your duct work is that it where your lowest point is because  they won't be necessarily always hung level  they're just about never running straight either. So you need to do a little bit of  fiddling around with your clearances. And stuff to make sure that everything's going to be straight. And nothing's going to be rubbing you don't want to make contact anywhere if you can help it with the duct work because one thing that'll happen is when your forced air furnace is running you get a bit of vibration in the duct work. And if it's up against the bulkhead especially when i'm using metal track like this you can get some vibration transferring through that as well. So and. And not only that. But even the heat factor  on the on the hot air duct you just want to have a little bit of clearance there against the wood. So you could do all of this with steel track or steel stud if you wanted to like i said it it's kind of up to your own imagination the the main thing is just building some kind of framework there to be able to suspend the drywall from. So okay. So we're we're going to get reset up again we're actually going to create this drop down section over on this side okay. So we've got our piece of metal track here that i'm going to put up on that other side. And i already have it all marked out. So just get your measurements mark it all out i've done the one cut. And bend down at this this end here. But the reason this stuff's nice to use is it's it's. So easy. And versatile. So these are the notches for where the 1x4s are going to lay in there. So i'm just going to pre-cut or you pre-cut. And fold all that stuff down out of the way just a pe pair of aviation snips is all you need to deal with this stuff. Now down at this end i've got a few marks going on  this mark here this one's a mistake this one with the arrow on it is the one i want. So i'm going to make that cut. And that's going to allow this end to actually fold up nice. And neat. So and. Then this is just a flap right here okay. So as you can see it's really simple to work with  all you need is some wafer screws to basically put it together or even for  screwing into the wood as you'll see me do. So that's why i like this product okay. So the first thing i'm going to do i've got my  lines all marked out on the ceiling. So you're going to have to obviously figure that out depending on your  situation i've got the marked out there i've got this pre-cut this is a piece of that channel that was up on the ceiling that we were trying to show you on the other side. So it would go up on the ceiling just like that the joist would be up here okay. So i'm going to put that up first  when you're working with this metal. And the wafer screws. And everything it's a good idea to  use safety glasses when you're working. And blow it because you might get a little file in the eye or something got a nail here got to pull okay. So i've got things marked out here i just just need to line myself up to them. And hold that in place. And get things started one thing with these wafer screws i should have put a magnetic tip in. And i didn't are we leaving that in okay continuing on that's going to happen good thing you got had my safety glasses on okay. So a wafer screw in there. And i'm just putting one up into every  joist it'll honestly take you longer to probably mark it all out. And get it figured out. Then to  build the bulkhead well maybe not on your first try. But okay. So we've got that on there. And again these are those are sharp too. So you just be careful should probably have gloves on okay. So i've got that in place. And i know where i want  my corner of the bottom track to be is going it's going to be right here on this pencil line. And and flush actually to the bottom of this closet opening. So i take my piece that i' kind of pre-made up. And hopefully you can see i don't know it's going to be kind of awkward we're in tight quarters here today another set of hands would definitely make this whole job a lot easier oops. Now i forgot to do is leave a little bit of space between the end of this. And the wood. So that i could slide that track up in there just cut a piece of that off actually i'm a little bit long i guess when i moved that mark that i was showing you before i didn't account for that on the end of this. So again nice. And easy pair of snips i can just simply pair of snips i can simply hack the end of that off there my camera man says that it's too noisy when i'm cutting. And trying to talk at the same time. So sorry about that just double check that that's going to work yeah that's going to be all right i'll see if i can get this up here by myself. And still half show you what i'm doing [applause] that's going to be all right. So i've got that one screw in there it'll kind of pivot on that right. Now i can put another one in up top having this all pre-marked out really helps. So you're not especially if you're working by yourself okay. Now this end this end here is going to flip up. And if i can get out of the way of the camera it's going to attach up here on the end of there. So i can simply just screw it right through the l l track or utility angle or whatever you want to call. Now i had a laser level set up. And i'm just going to see i can't really tell with all our crazy lights i've got going on here i'm going to kill the lights for a minute. Then we can hopefully see you can make out the red laser line right there i think. So that's what i'm shooting for to get everything nice. And and level here might be well i'm just a hair high maybe on this end. But it's basically the thickness of the laser line it's actually pretty true. So how is the camera all right with the lights out okay. So we're going to leave the lights out he says that he can see what i'm doing. So it'll make it easier for you to kind of see that what the laser's doing. And i'm just going to put in my wood studs. Now so i'll just mark that out i was just  going two foot on center on those i guess i really just need two there felt marker when you're working with that metal track or metal stud works really well it just draws on there perfectly. So like i said these are cut actually a little bit short i'm about a quar inch shorter what i figured i needed to have because i've got the space inside of that track to basically put them up or down to whatever i need. So i'll just push it up right tight in that angle track up top [applause] here like. So i'll throw the the other second one up here too actually my twoot on center interferes a little bit with  those 1x4s there. So i'm just going to slide it slightly over okay. So those are hanging there. Now i can use my  laser level laser line to adjust that bottom up. And down to get it where i want it it's still you probably aren't seeing it over here as well as i can because of the window behind me. But it's i am nice. And red right there. So there's that one. And right there is that one okay. So that's those two. So i've i've got that laser just sitting blocked up to the right height that i needed it. And it really helps i mean you could do all this with a level. And or some string lines or whatever. But if you've got the availability of a a laser level that'll really save you a lot of messing around okay. So you can see that's pretty floppy right. Now but  once we get everything screwed off. And tightened up it'll get it much tighter i'm going to put a screw in the end up here you probably might not really see it okay. So just like that okay. And we we know that we're plumb down at that end because i had it marked out already  this should be plum here. But we'll just double check it. And it's not stiff enough that i can't kind of adjust it a little bit if it's not not 100% yeah the bottom's got to come over maybe an eighth of an inch to my right. So that'll come over there i think i just did it right there we can play with that when we're putting in our 1x4s okay. So that's the basic gist of that there i should throw a couple more screws up in this end. And these are just  5/8 wafer screws i mean you could go one in if you wanted to depending what you're screwing into. But there's really no thickness to this to the metal oops. So 5/8 is getting me pretty good bite on all the wood that i'm screwing into okay there we are there okay. So now my 1x4 cross pieces can go in this  this side i've got nice. And rigid. So i'm going to use it as my guideline i can lay these up in here with any luck at all they all fit in we have to come in  from here bit a tight fit okay. So i'm just going to get them all in they loose for right. Now and again i don't have these cut to the exact length either they've got a little bit of play in them. So i can maneuver them around where i need to that notch is a little small. So i'll just make that a little bigger i got them all in okay. So like i said i'll just double check that this side's still okay since i was reefing on it a little bit it's good that's good. So what i'll do is i'll fasten that end the 1x4s in. And again i'm just using the wafer screws. And i'll just check my width can't remember what it was i think it was 43 no it's 47 yeah 47 this end i can't really move. So i know that that's what we're using is our finished width. So i can screw this 1x4 in here this 1x4 kind of does two jobs gives something  through the middle here for the drywall to screw to. And it also just helps you  space this these two  kind of mini walls get them spaced out. So that they're the right distance apart. And equal that's right on right there sc that before it moves see what we are here huh that's right on the money too i guess you got to get lucky sometimes normally you'd be you know flexing that in or out whatever you needed to to get it. So it's all equal distance part unless you're trying to make some funky shaped bulkhead okay. So then on this end keep putting my freaking measure down this end here that's right on there too i'm just going to put a piece of this metal angle on here. So it'll just simply cap this end off here. And create a corner there. So you have something for all the drywall to attach to. And then i'm just going to add a piece of  2x4 onto here up to that joist just to kind of finish everything off okay. So like i said i  actually this piece might work here i was going to say i don't have a piece cut. But this one might actually it looks like that's maybe going to work just. So i don't have to shut the lights out again i'm just going to use a straight edge across here to make sure it's not pushing that down too much no it's not. So i'm going to use that block of wood in there like. So i'll just put a couple toenail screws in there got a light right here in the way one's probably enough. But [applause]. And i'll throw one into this kind of that backbone piece there too just to make sure everything holds [applause] it okay. So everything's good. And solid oh i've got to attach these we'll just use just use some deck screws for that okay. So about the only thing i've got left to do we've got everything in there. So that should be fine well the only thing i've got left to do is you need to go around anywhere where this bulkhead is going to butt up against the wall or whatever you can see here in the closet how again i just use some of that utility channel because that's what i had. And i attached it to the wall here. So this drywall has somewhere to go or somewhere to attach  in this wall i'll probably add some blocks in here just. So the wall drywall has something attached to too. But just look around make sure that everywhere you know you need to get screws or to hang the drywall that there's going to be some backing there to do it this drywall is going to come right through the closet right over to that wall at this level. So i need a piece of utility angle across this wall. And that'll pretty much finish it up i just i ran short on  on the angle. So i don't have a piece to do it right. Now i don't think there's any other real tricks or secrets to give you  i've said it lots  it's really really comes down to what your particular situation is you know as far as what your exact approach might be to do this there's probably 20 different ways that  somebody could do the same exact same situation. So you know whatever kind of works for you it might even just be using up material that you have around or  you know maybe you got some 2x4s. And you rip them into 2x2s to do this  screw it all together. And it'll it'll do the job for sure. So i think that's going to be the wrap up for for this video hopefully  it gets you along your way or at least started on the any bulkhead that you might want to do in the future it gives you a little bit of insight anyways as to the basics of what you need to figure out. And how to get started. So if you want you can  follow us also on facebook. And twitter. And you can  check out our patreon campaign that we have going.

And i'm going to show you how to install a new prehung [music] door. So when you're installing a door first thing you want to do is take your level  find out if the frame has been done properly generally speaking the door frame is usually 2 in wider than the size that's indicated on your door. So we have a 24in door. And a 26in hole we have half in jam material which gives us a little bit of play in case it's not perfectly square  we're pretty decently level which is fine. Now our door is going to go in the hole here. And our jam material [music] you can see i've got good play. So we're going to be absolutely fine. So before we install our door it's important to know what your finished flooring is going to be cuz we're doing it at an early phase this floor is going to be tiled. So before we tile we have to add 5/8,https://youtu.be/h1nMWfLiQC4?t=0,"['What is the typical width of a door frame compared to the size indicated on the door?', 'Why is there half-inch jam material in the door frame?', 'What type of flooring will be installed after this project is completed?', 'How does the level help with the installation process?', 'Why is it important to know the finished flooring before installing a new door?']"

And needed in ontario to cover any kind of teron warranty don't install it with anything less. So we're going to put 5/ in shim there install our door on top top of it that way once we've installed our plywood. And tile we still have a proper gap with the bottom of the door once you have your door in place you open up the swing. And then you just lift the door. And the jam until it's somewhat flush with your frame. And then pack a bunch of shims underneath to carry the way to the door.

And we want to make that one perfectly level. So once you've got your door in position you take a shim. And you want to put shims in behind the door coming from two different directions that way if your if your wall is square. And you put,https://youtu.be/h1nMWfLiQC4?t=118,"['What type of material are shims typically made of?', 'Why is it important to make the hinge side perfectly level?', 'How many shims should be placed behind the door from each direction?', 'What happens when a wall is considered square in relation to shim placement?', 'Can shims be used for other types of doors or hardware?']"

And you put your shims in from different directions you keep even spacing inside. And outside the door you don't get the frame twisting if you put all the shims from one direction you'll get a twisted frame. And your door won't function properly. So we're going to throw the shim in from each direction just till it's snug we're going to add ourselves a screw. And effectively where the door stop is going to be installed later. And it'll cover the screws. So i'm going to be using this here just to get a perfectly flush with the [music] wall done. And we'll do that same process. And each hinge up the side of the door like with any construction framers are trying to get something done give or take they don't use nice 6t long levels they're not concerned about everything being perfectly level they're just trying to get close it's the finishing where you have to be perfect. So what we do is we put our level up against the jam. And identify roughly the space that we need which is you know 38 to a/ an inch which is normal. So that's nice because i can put one shim in from the top one side. And then from the other side you'll notice i've got one shim set above the the hinge. And one shim set below the hinge. And i put my level from each of those two locations wow i don't think that would get much better if i tried if you're working alone again take the shim use it like a straight edge go across the corner drywall the drywall make sure your jam is in contact all right hold that jam you've got your screw set. Now hold your shims otherwise when the screw grabs the wood it'll sprin it around might cause an accident get the shims in going different [music] directions put the level up from shim to shim not just at the bottom okay make sure you cover both of the shims. And then we're just going to push this until the the gap is completely closed. Now here it's closed at the top. And not the bottom. So we're going to adjust for a new location because we're dealing with wood there we go you might find that putting a shim lower down is better than putting it higher up if you're dealing with mdf it's not quite. So particular. But with wood same thing you take your screw where the door jam is going to be hold your shims there's that side done. So now at this point we don't need to have the shims supporting the door anymore we can just take these out put them back in our pile here for use. And we close the door. And check to see if the jam's in the right spot. So now when know we're installing a door you're involving all the laws of carpentry square level. And flush. So we're level on the jam side we're square because the door is built that way we're flesh cuz we're using our shims to get our jam. And the drywall together over here what we have to do. Now is make sure that the door has a consistent gap. So we're full 1/8 here. And we're rubbing. So we come down here to the shim. And this is where having these shims underneath the door is really handy cu you can just keep adjusting this until he gets right the door perfect there we go. So now we're going to do the same thing again only we're going to take our shims. And we're going to start from the top. And work our way down. So you're continually just working your way around the frame of the door if you have any problems you just take one step backwards cuz that's where you ran into your problem all right this one's the easiest because the jam is already attached. So same thing we'll put one in from the other side [music]. And then one from this [music] side until we're happy. And then we have to open the door. So we can put a screw in it same thing you got to move the jam until it's flesh go corner to corner on the drywall okay the door is an inch. And a half thick put the screw where the door stop is going to go hold your shins [music]. And then proceed to try about the [music] middle. And line up about the same amount of gap. And make sure it's flush. And then put in another screw important to note when you're putting in your [music] screw remember that when you're adding these shims to set the thickness you want it to be just a little bit tighter than the last spot that you worked on because when you put the screw in it will compress those shims. And it'll actually be a bigger hole than you thought was going to be there by about a 302 of an inch. But if you like to make things perfect like me that's important okay. So this framing is a little twisted at the bottom. So what we're going to do is we're going to put,https://youtu.be/h1nMWfLiQC4?t=139,"['What type of shims are used for door installation?', 'Why is it essential to use shims from different directions when installing a door?', 'How does using a level ensure proper alignment during door installation?', 'What happens if the door jam is not properly aligned with the surrounding drywall?', 'How do you adjust the gap between the door and the frame to achieve a consistent fit?']"

And a question that i seem to get a lot from folks is how do i hang heavy objects on the walls to my house without worrying that they're going to fall down well there are five different pieces of hardware that are used very often for this i'd like to show them all to you. And go over the advantages of each. So come on over here to the workbench. Now pretty much everything i'm going to be talking about right. Now is designed to go into this type of wall material this is a wall board. And if your house was built to remodel since about 1950 this is what the walls are made of. So here are the five things that i want to show you starting with these picture hangers that use very small nails. Then moving on to the plastic anchors with screws. And from there to the screw anchors also using screws. And then these hollow wall fasteners often known as molly bolts. And finally over here the big guys the ones that can handle almost any hanging job the toggle bolts. So what i've done is set up a couple of demonstration walls let's go over there. And i'll show you how to use each one of these let's start with these,https://youtu.be/mJHrM4rup9o?t=0,"['What type of wall material are the hardware designed for?', 'When was most houses built using this type of wall material?', 'What is the primary advantage of picture hangers?', 'How do plastic anchors with screws work?', 'What is the main difference between screw anchors and hollow wall fasteners?']"

And i'll show you how to use each one of these let's start with these picture hangers which are ideal for small medium even large size pictures as a matter of fact you would be amazed at how much weight little hanger like that can actually support i'm going to show you okay we'll just dry this in what i have here is a 25 lb bar bel we're going to hang this over the hook. Now this guy here with the two nails rated for 50 lb okay. Now i don't advocate pushing these hangers to the limit like this.

And then go ahead. And bore through the wallboard there. Now we'll just insert these plastic anchors with those in we're all set to attach whatever kind of bracket we're going to be using this is for the toel bar right here. And these screws go right into those plastic sleeves. Now what's happening here is as i put this screw in it's actually cutting a thread in that plastic insert. And sort of forcing it  open. And jamming it in the hole here. Now this feels pretty solid. But what i don't like about these plastic anchors for a towel bar like this is if you put a lot of pressure downward on this like a child might do trying to climb up you can rip it right out of the wall.

Now the reason those plastic anchors don't work. So well for a towel bar or say a shelving bracket like this is that the pressure is not just down like this. But it's also pulling out for a situation like that you need an anchor that grips the wall from the back something like this this is called a hollow wall anchor sometimes known as a molly [music] bolt. Now watch what happens when i tighten this up that molly bolt is going to flare out on the back side of the walls just like that okay. Now that we flared those anchors out on the back side of the wall i'm going to reverse the drill. And take the screws out. Now we just take these screws that,https://youtu.be/mJHrM4rup9o?t=168,"['What type of anchor is used for gripping the wall from the back?', 'Why do plastic anchors fail in certain situations?', 'How does a molly bolt work?', 'What happens when tightening a molly bolt?', 'What is the purpose of flaring out the back side of the anchor?']"

And take the screws out. Now we just take these screws that we just took out. And put them back in through the holes of the bracket. Now that is really snug. But if you've got really heavy objects big books st large stereo speakers or if you're hanging anything from the ceiling. Then you want to go to these these are called toggle bolts. Now when you're drilling the hole for the toggle bolt you have to pick a bit that's the same diameter as the folded toggle. Now to install these we're going to squeeze the wings of the toggle together like that just push them into the hole. Now watch what happens on the back side here as it comes through see it sort of springs out like that. And then catches in the back side of the wall all we have to do. Now is tighten up those [music] bolts. Now you got a bracket it is really strong. Now i don't recommend doing chinups on a bracket that's put up with toggle bolts. But as you can see both of these types of anchors can support a lot of weight i've got almost 100 lbs up here on this shelf. So whether you want to hang a 5b picture or put up a shelf that can support 100 lb or more. Now you have to know how to do it if you'd like more information on this project or our house call be sure.

So in a lot of cases when we're working in a job site. And we're changing the tub or tub surround the idea here is to try to minimize the scope of work. And fortunately in this situation the client wanted to go from every standard 30-inch wide to a 32 inch wide. And so that creates a lot of little nuances that we're gonna cover in this tub installation video because if you can install a larger tub into an existing smaller space you're gonna stop anytime on the planet okay. So let's get started i just wanted to point out first before we get moving how about the quality of the of the tub that we're using this is a maryland tub it's called the tucson the 32 inch is called the tucson this has got an acrylic tub. But it's a sprayed fiberglass reinforced acrylic okay this is extremely strong. And it's it's a little bit more advanced than some of the products are available on the shelf of the building store. So keep an eye out for this because the price point is really minimal for an extra thirty or forty dollars you can get a high quality acrylic tub instead of something that's gonna have a lot of deflection. And risk cracking over time okay. So you'll notice that this is a little piece of chipboard plywood reinforced tile sprayed. And glued together. But this is the skirt. And this is the translates a lot of the load on the front side of the tub. And when this is all sprayed together with the fiberglass it makes it incredibly strong you'll also notice on the back side there are a series of wooden block feet here. And that directly translates the weight of the tub when it's full of water to the subfloor underneath. So that you don't risk getting any cracks around the drain without those feet this ends up opening up. And splitting a lot of times. And this crack here is not a crack that you can fix with the repair guy okay they might come. And fix it for you. But it will crack again. So the only way to avoid that is to buy a tub that has these reinforced feet don't rely on the skirt to take care of all the weight you need to give support to the bottom of the tub. So the one thing you need to take care of before you start the idea of putting in a larger tub than what you have. Now is you need to understand which direction your floor joists are running if you don't have access from underneath to see exactly the proximity of them you run the risk of this there could be a floor joist right here. And if that's the case when you open this up remember the your tub drain is going to be moving to a new center location. And if it's right on the where the joist is. Then you're not going to be able to put that install there without compromising your joy strength. And that's a brand new world i'll know you can do this. But you need to get that engineered. And it's a really big expense otherwise you're gonna have creaks. And cracks. And movement going on maybe damage in the ceiling underneath. So the way you can check that out is go to the heat register vent in the bathroom put your arm down the hole. And see which way the elbow goes okay which way the elbow goes will be the same direction as the joist if they're running this way into the tub you're gonna have lots of room in your cavity to move your plumbing to the new location guaranteed.

So the other things you need to keep in mind is the framing around the tub remember when your framing around the tub traditionally you're gonna want to have wood backing off the corner of the tub. So you can attach your your overhead shower rod or even future if you're gonna put in glass or a door kit you want to have wood there you don't want to rely on the strength of the wall board. And the tile to support that. So we want to make sure we reframe we also want to add whatever blocking at the same time for our shower features the less work we do after the tub is installed the better outside of that i think if we've cut it all the basics covered make sure to check the level of the floor when they built the house originally it may have been level. But every house settles in the middle because it's wood it'll all shrink just a little bit there's almost guaranteed to be a slope. And if you want your tub perfectly level you're gonna have to do some shimming. So keep that in mind as well. So there's really three things that we need to do when we're putting a larger type into an existing smaller hole one is we have to open up the subfloor to reconnect the drain to we have to eliminate this all this plumbing. And start all over again. And the third thing is we have to cut back the tile. And the underlayment. So the tub can fit in inside of that area like i said when the house gets a little older it tends to slope in the middle. And if i try to level this tub. Now i'll be flush on the outside wall. And i got almost a half an inch gap difference here by cutting all this back. And creating a new line i can install this time. And have nothing. But a silicone joint available to the naked eye later. So what we've done is we've opened up a,https://youtu.be/ziYQaxYQv94?t=195,"['What type of wood backing should be used around the tub?', 'Why is it important to add blocking for shower features?', 'How does a house settle over time and affect plumbing installation?', 'What are the three main steps involved in installing a larger tub into an existing smaller hole?', 'What can happen if a tub is not installed level with the floor?']"

And then back to the drain which you know contradicts what i definitely would have done as far as my process. But that's fine what i've done is i've gone out. And i bought this brass drain kit. And the reason i bought this is because of the flexibility i need to move my dream to a new location around here. But all of the fittings in this plumbing here are joint to joint to joint. And although i'm able to take that off it's just really labour time consuming. So this enables made a change from this pipe over i can put on this new team that's a brass put this pipe to where it goes center i can come off the existing pipe right here. And i can actually snake in the corner of this pipe here which is awesome. So i can get that extra inch. And a half out of it just by bending my copper neck this enables me to do all my plumbing have it leak proof. And it's a lot quicker. Now it's only an extra 15 dollars more than the aps drain system.

And it slices through in the abs you know if i'm lucky i put it right up to the fitting go at it from both directions it'll almost complete the cut. And the secret that doing good plumbing is cutting perpendicular. And trying to cut in here with this might be a little tricky. And i could always lay it right in here. And fish it back. And forth. But it's a little too big. And cumbersome. So i went out. And i bought myself this cute little hack software just occasions like this i can actually get in here you know this is gonna take a minute. But it'll get the job done once you get three-quarters of the way through you don't generally just give up the ghost okay. So you don't need to clean avs fittings with sand cloth. But i can't see what's going on in behind there. So i'm just making sure that i've got any of the old solvent out of the way.

So i gotta do generously apply this solvent to both pieces. And without wasting too much time push. And twist get that on there nice. And tight okay. So now we just got to prep up our brass drink it this is all compression fits with some positions there's gaskets some of us just thread like here. So when it's just thread i use a pipe joint compound this acts like a sealer let me put that back in where it came from nice. And tight okay. Now these others joints it's just a washer. And a nut system all right. So what we're gonna do. Now is just measure off where this goes we'll loosen up this collar well we have the ability to raise or lower this okay according to the dimensions on the tub which is awesome you'll see how this operates here put the ring on first. And then the washer okay goes in afterwards okay let me slip this over. And it's a nice snug fit. And i thing here is we. Now have to cut this pipe to fit all right that's not my final location before we put the lift of the tempo we mark the center drain on the floor all right. And so we've got the dimensions on that is nine four off the wall. And seventeen off that wall. So what i do is i'm gonna go in here. Now let's see what this pipe is that is nine. And that is not 17. So in order to get it over to this location i've got to make this pipe shorter. So we want to do is go like this. Now and we're measuring to the center hole eyeball this bad boy yeah that's gonna be good there okay. So my eyeball that's about the edge of where my pipe goes you can see that inside this fitting there is room for that pipe to be extended okay i'll mark it just you can see i have a half inch of play. So if that's what i'm guessing i'm gonna split the difference i'm gonna go to quarter inch of play i also have the ability for this to move around just a little bit on me. So that'll make it real easy to install the time okay all right. Then we just take the hacksaw. And cut that off this is one of these cases we're having some santa claus is brilliant makes it a lot easier to put the fitting on okay. So we're in the ring on put the gasket on i mean this is snug it's really you're difficult to do with the gloves on there we go okay again we're just still doing the rough fit here we haven't connected or tightened up any of the pennies 17 right there okay. Now the other thing we have to do is find out how far off the ground that tub is gonna be because we were using this type of drain system we were actually able to tie into the original abs that was coming out we've locked onto cholera adjusted all of our pipes created our center point here of 17. And 9. And we created our senator point here just according to the dimensions on the tub well the only,https://youtu.be/ziYQaxYQv94?t=461,"['What type of solvent is used for cleaning and preparing brass components?', 'How does a pipe joint compound act as a sealer in threaded joints?', 'What is the purpose of using a washer and nut system in certain joints?', 'How do you determine the correct length of a pipe to fit into a specific location?', 'What is the process for cutting a pipe to fit a specific location, such as a tub or drain?']"

Now is just cut back the tile i've got a beautiful porcelain tile bit on here i picked this up in my tile supply store cost me 35 bucks you can get something comparable in the hardware store for about 60. And we're just gonna run the vacuum. And cut this out make sure you protect yourself you're gonna fly in stone going everywhere [music] lots of material that's good there i like that. So that's just gonna install some vapor barrier for us it's got a great little trick it looks like for doing this if you're a little short there you go like that i'm gonna use that one day. So we have got our extra framing in the wall we've got our drain done we've got our floor cut back.

So that we're ready to drop the tub in. So we're ready to install our tub finally we've got our plumbing rough-in tied into the wall our drain is assembled their floors cut back on framing has done the vapor barrier is intact. And we're gotten all this point without expanding the scope of work outside of the fact that we had to cut the floor. So so far is a good day all right. Now there is no one way to do this you're gonna have to do a little bit of trial. And error just remember the backside. And the each end are open. So you have the ability to do a little bit of twisting. And rolling when you're trying to get these into position the key is to hold it off the ground the entire time until you're ready to set it down the last few inches. So you don't accidentally put too much pressure on one of the corners of the skirt which will always be visible. And if you break that you got to go buy a new tent okay there we go. So we're flush up against this where's our drain that'll be perfect this is on the flexible connection. So we can put that in place later.

So we can put that in place later. So now that we have our tub in place. And we're solid we want to connect all of the plumbing before we connect the tub to the walls. And i'll tell you why because the plumbing is only got. So much flexibility down here i want to get this one mounted the drain. And then i want to connect the overflow which is on the flexible neck. So that'll work out really well what we got is you're gonna take care of one thing here. And that is this protective plastic. And now i'm only mentioning this because everybody who's ever got into building things. And putting in plumbing for the first time until you've had a leak. And you found out this because of this plastic was in the way you don't know that you need to remove it. So i'm gonna save you that problem get the plastic out of the way you don't want to have any of that protective plastic where you're putting your fixtures. So you want to get your white silicone that's designed for kitchens. And baths. And you want to get it on your thread here. And a couple of lines. And you want to put it just a thin layer around the seal here on their first attempt of doing this series of plumbing in the bathroom we had a few plumbers came in. And they tied in with the fact that this particular style of acrylic tub is not conducive with the old fashioned plumber putty. And apparently there's concern that the putty will break down the acrylic over time. So they suggest using this bathroom silicone. So now you take your tub tool. And we're causing compression on that rubber gasket that's underneath to the tub surface we're just gonna lift that up until it's nice. And tight here we go once we have it snug we'll throw a screwdriver across the top. And give an extra very happy turn all right at this point wipe out the extra silicone it's not necessary to be in there anymore. Now we got that we've done i always put my drink happen right away make sure it's covered up. Now here's my overflow. And i'm just gonna reach him behind. And put my gas get back in place. Now very difficult to install the tub. And not knock this off. Now you can see i'm a little bit low i'm just gonna tuck on that neck extension until i'm right where i want it. And this is where this kit comes in real handy a lot of overflow systems have a little bar. And you tighten it up with a drill. And you just got to get in the right spot. And you may or may not have it good contact this one actually has a threaded cap that goes over top. And so this one here gives you the ability just go backwards until you feel it sit in. And then you go forward that way you won't cross thread actually not if after you turn it a couple of times. And it's given you a lot of resistance you might be cross thread. So just back it off. And try it again. Now you can use the tub tool here as well okay as a screwdriver you can see on here there's a couple of prongs there's something to tighten it up against. And you're just gonna find that middle point because the back of that overflow is flexible it'll not just move up. And down. But also twist side to side. So that you can get a perfect compression right there okay. Now if at any point you're concerned at all about leaking you can as a management tactic you can actually silicone around that this plastic to the acrylic can be silicone. And create a secondary seal. But the finish on this actually has this really cool little thing it's a little different look from how s&b. And it has a slotted groove that goes over top of the edge of that you know how sleek is that not seeing any screws very sexy.

Now it's inevitable whenever you're installing a tub one of the things we joke about in our businesses we never find a room that's square you'll never find an alcove that's square. So once you've done drop into some shims all the way around the tub. And that is where you will put your screws to attach the tub to the wall once you've done attaching it cut off the shims remove them out of the way if you're concerned at all about the acrylic breaking you can actually get a pilot drill. And just drill a small little hole before you put your screw i suggest flooring screws because they're coated. And they won't rust as fast. But if you really want to go crazy you could always buy stainless steel. Now here we go once we've got that all set up. And that's more than one shim thick here we go these are actually ac cubes or deck screws. But they'll do the same thing you'll see we get started. And it'll drill its own hole. And you can run it almost flush okay don't go too crazy with this because you will crack it. And that's all you need yeah perfect. So once you get that in here we go. Now we got in this tub is installed alright. So that covers everything you need to know about installing the tub don't forget the last thing we have to do here is actually cut the shims off because our wall boards gonna come down. And sit right on top of the integrated tile flange your tire will come all all down. And sit on this ledge alright. So if you enjoy this kind of video.

So before we start doing this  let me just talk about the parts real quick the riell pro system comes with a surface mounted plate. And this gets screwed to the roughing valve that's in the wall. And it has a gasket on the back that seals to the tile. Now depending on the tile condition you may or may not want to use a silicone bead after you're done a lot of times this sort of thing doesn't work if you're using a subway tile because there are inconsistencies with the surface texture. And the gr lines if it's a really large piece of stone. And you're cut right down the middle. Then this is plenty enough to seal it shut. So what you have to do is you want to take your long screw they come really big. And put it into the the wall. And just slide your fingers on it till you the surface that's your surface depth that you have to put the screws into. And then you go look backwards until you see the next ring all right. And this is a soft brass. And you just take your side cutters all right. And you just give them a shot like that. And that one's cut to fit again just confirm that i did that right there we go back to there. And use your side cutters okay there we are. And now we have our plate. So we slide it over our valve trim. And we want to do this first before we add all the other pieces because we need the extra light going in there to find the holes okay. And just wiggle it around. And just put it fingertight for. Now there we go okay wonderful next thing you want to do is put on a glove because these brass fittings that they make for these shower valves are very very sharp. And find somewhere to put that is not going to wreck anything take out the temporary test plug throw that in the garbage all right. So in this particular case. And you have to be really careful to check your instructions for all these things cuz every system is a little bit different in this particular case there is an extension that goes with the valve probably because the valve body is made really deep from this particular manufacturer. So that it can handle pressure balance multi-port plus thermostatic valve. So this is just an extension of this valve here. So these two pieces will sit together. And then this end here with the gaskets. And the pins will sit right in the cradle. So all you do is slide this stuff in. And there you go once you feel it sink into those two pins you're good all right. Now this is just the decorative,https://youtu.be/cCfeqL5VQHA?t=22,"['What type of plate comes with the Riell Pro system?', 'How does the gasket seal to the tile?', 'Why may silicone bead not be used for subway tiles?', 'What tool is used to cut the soft brass ring?', 'What should you do before adding other pieces to the valve trim?']"

Now this is just the decorative chrome trim that goes over the brass fitting there is a hole near the front that goes on the bottom that's in case any water gets into that valve. And it has a way to drain that doesn't go in behind the wall all right another good reason why when you're installing your valve in the wall don't be afraid to install it just like one degre slope that way all the water that gets into that valve will drain out of the valve [music]. Now there's a gasket there we go we want to tighten up our [music] screws. And just snug don't overtighten it's just made of plastic. And you'll destroy it. And then after that you just set this on the name of the company riel goes at the bottom. And you snap it in place no screws. And if you ever need to remove it you can just get a good hold of it. And give it a good tug. And it'll pop off again. So here we are i was. So focused on making a video i forgot the most important part just about to turn the water on. And my brain went wait you haven't put the yeah look at this if i don't put this on first the whole valve assembly is going to come firing across the room wreck my silicone work wreck my day. Now here's a again before you pull any tools that check the manufacturers instructions these guys actually aren't a big fan of wrenches here even though it's set up for it they want you to go fingertight for a reason cu they want to make sure that everything is lined up properly. And you can feel it okay if you start using a wrench. And it isn't lined up properly you may not even notice [music] it here we go quarter turn is plenty i happen to know from experience that that is going to work out great here we go oh before we put the handle on i got to put this on again we're doing this a little bit backwards. But this will still work okay there we go. Now the water's still off. So i can cheat get my set screw in there okay. And then don't forget the cap. So that when you turn the water on it doesn't get all wet. And it'll look pretty hot. And cold on off that's simple all right we have our face plate our handle. And our little set screw cover all in place. So we can leave that for.

Now let's move on to the tub spo. Now the tub spout of course is a  let me just pull it out. And i'll show you this unit [applause] it should be a slipon yes. Now before i went. And did the plumbing for this bathroom i inquired with the company because it didn't have the finishing trim on hand. And they assured me that it was a slip on. And so that's why i ran a half copper. And put a test cap on it. And of course comes with its own allen key. And that's the set screw for this. So you have to back this one off you'll see it comes fully inserted that'll dry you crazy trying to push that on the line. So just back that off until it's out of the way.

And now it's ready to install okay the handle. And we're just going to take a little pipe cutter. Now this slipon starts here. And there's lots of room in that pipe all the way in. So you can see we're good to go. So what i generally like to do is i like to cut it as far out as i can here around 3 in in case you ever want to change that to another system. And you need to have the ability to to solder on a male thread some of these fixtures that come they have a threaded pipe in here. So this way if i leave a little extra pipe. And i've got a solder on a connection. And do any other the plumbing in another date the option is there for somebody if you cut too far back it just makes it really difficult to fix it later not every company does everything the same way. So it's nice to leave yourself options when you're working you'll be surprised when you're in this business business how often you'll get a call from a client 5 10 or 15 years later. And they want to just make one little modification or a couple of changes or even six weeks down the road. Now this has got a little bit of water in it i drain the line. So it shouldn't be under pressure there we go of course remember we're going to be using our silicone when we're done the finishing trim. So as soon as you can get that water cleaned off the gro. So that it doesn't absorb too much the better you want to have that gr line as dry as possible when you go to silicone. So that you know it's going to stick before you put your fixture on grab your sand cloth. And just give the edge quick [music] buff okay if your edges aren't too sharp it's not going to wreck your little gasket in here. And it won't hurt your fingers either you just force that one on okay you want to just make sure that the name is up. And everything looks square reach underneath with the allen key find that little spot okay there we go remember these are all plastic parts in there. So don't overtighten just make it nice. And solid here we go what's that old song two out of three ain't bad. But we're not done yet this is the riel pro two jet shower head they have a three jet shower head. And rain shower head options. And it's just manual control right here right you got to love it well that is some good looking shower head okay. So this particular shower head also comes with the arm. And there's a little flange here as well. And that's nice it comes with a secer to tell you which direction the water should be flowing which is kind of funny cuz traditionally the longer p piece of pipe does go in the wall. And that's kind of normal. So it's nice to see i've been doing it right all these years okay. And so this is nothing simp it is nothing to this this flange is really basic. And it is just a compression fit okay you just want to wiggle it on. And there's little teeth on the back that have been kind of snapped out of the tin. And so you put that in there like that okay. And then you're good to go. Now hopefully i don't get soak. And wet here either oh yeah here we go well if you haven't seen the project video. And you haven't familiar with these i buy these in my specialty plumbing store. And this is the same size as this pipe. But it has a little gasket on it. So these are temporary that i put in there that's a shut off system it's also a identification system for installing wallboard. And tile it's exactly the same dimension as my pipe. And so when i install this i know exactly how to make my cuts. So these tiny little flanges that they come with when i go.

Now for installing the shower arm in your wall okay you want to take your teflon tape. And you just roll it around three four five 6 7 8 9 ridiculously 10 times around. And i'll tell you why i'm paranoid i'm doing a compression fit inside a wall cavity. And after i turn the water on if it doesn't work it'll leak. And no one will know until it makes a big mess on the ceiling downstairs. And because i'm paranoid i to go a little overboard i also like to take a little bit of this thread sealer paste. And run it up onto the female fitting inside the wall. So now i've got two kinds of seal that are going on in here there we go okay. Now here's a secret go back backwards a little bit until you feel it sit in the in the okay. Now this is going to be snug right out of the gate. So it's hard to tell the difference between cross threaded or just install brass on brass. Now you want to fight with this until you get it in there perfect it's exactly nice. And tight like i like it however it's pointing up at the ceiling. So we have to fix that. So these shower arms are not made of metal that won't break. So you have to be gentle. And careful with this. But i like to get a little extra leverage on this instead of holding it here i like to hold it out here. So i'll put a screwdriver right in through the hole turn. And use my hand on the pipe okay. Now the shower head it has,https://youtu.be/cCfeqL5VQHA?t=636,"['What type of tape is recommended for installing a shower arm?', 'How many times should you roll Teflon tape around the threads?', 'Why is the author paranoid about installing the shower arm?', ""What happens if the compression fit doesn't work properly?"", 'What can happen if the shower head leaks and no one notices it?']"

Now the shower head it has little flat pieces on the neck here that's for a wrench it's amazing how many people call. And complain that there's a little drip of water coming out of here. And going right into their tub oh my. But it happens. Now inside here there's a gasket okay. So that should work just compression f fingertight all right. So once you think you got it figuring tight reach in behind there find those little flat sections give it a couple more turns. And try to get it on there as tight as you can [music]. Now at this point it should be pretty much sitting on that gasket. And the way you make sure that this is done is you grab your wrench set it on the flat pieces okay. And you give it a couple of turns. But make sure you're only grabbing the flat pieces of that shower fixture all right. So now we got all of our fixtures installed it's time to clean up do all of our silicone.

So what we're going to do. Now is we're going to prep for our new tub this is the old waist overflow system oh sorry this is the old waist. And overflow system  it was designed for the tub that was here before i believe it was about a 16in tub yeah. And it there you go. And it sat about 13 in high the new tub is a 20-in tub. And so our overflow is definitely going to be in a different location. And i don't want to have to reuse a plastic waste it is a threaded connection. And we rely on that threaded connection for our compression. So since it's been used we're going to cut it out. And install a new one. And we're going to get rid of both of them. Now i have this fabulous little tool here from rigid has a little spine on it. And it cuts abs pipe really easy just lay it on spin it around. And then you're good as done [music] like most plumbing the secret to good plumbing of course yes you guessed it sandpaper we want to always scratch. And score whether it's copper whether it's brass whether it's abs pvc you always want to rough up your surface cuz everything we're doing involves adhesives or torch or solder. And so all of these things require a clean scratched up surface.

So that everything has something to bond to before we can prep. And install our waist overflow we need to take our measurements off our tub every manufacturers just a little bit different where the center line on the drain is how far off the wall it's going to be. So while i still have it in the box i'm going to stick my measuring tape through the hole to the box. And i mark my center line at 8. And 1/2 in okay. So when i'm doing my plumbing upstairs i marked that off at 8. And 1/2 in has a little bit of play to it. So we won't have any difficulty installing it this here is our tub this is a maryland tub it's a fabulous quality they have a reinforced skirt with plywood sprayed on fiberglass 5 ft reinforced bars going to the skirt for transferring the load right onto the skirt  i haven't found a more econom ical quality tub on the market this is why i'm recommending maryland these are all the components of our waste overflow system  we picked this one it's an abs system. So you have to do the measuring. And get all the heights just right there are other alternatives out there that are a bit more flexible. And adjustable. But for the sake of our client here we're going to keep our costs down. And just make sure we measure correctly this is a really nice cover plate as well  has a nice sleek look doesn't look like a traditional waste overflow. So anyway we have an 18 sorry an 8. And 1/2 off the wall mark. So what we're going to do is mark this that's my center [music] line. So i'm going to hold this roughly in the center. And you can see that after i install i have a little bit of flexibility not. So much front. And back. But left. And right. So we have to get this line pretty much dead on. So just like the plumbing pipes we're going to scratch up the inside of our fittings make sure that everything is nicely scratched matched up we got our abs glue here to get a good run stick that on give it a bit of a turn okay.

Now what we're doing here is we're using the existing p trap. And the existing te to save ourselves a little bit of time. And headache replacing the old tub with a similar size. So we didn't have to risk the potential problems of running into where there might have been a joist right on the the line that we're working on okay. So my 8. And 1/2 center means that i need a piece of [music] pipe that [music] is these pipe cutters are awesome they come 1. And 1/2 in 2 in 3 in you just stick it on. And go i must have cut two maybe 2 50 fittings already. And i haven't had to change the [music] blade. And we're going to wait to put the waist overflow the overflow neck on because we want to get the tub in place first. And then make sure that we can get that to the perfect location you can see that the way that this works is when this is in position not a whole lot of mo room here to make a mistake. So you put your gasket over top of it. And then the hole in the tub is actually quite large. So you can only be up or down maybe 1/8 of an inch before you run the risk of leaks. So it's got to be exact. So we're going to wait till the tubs in placed. And level. Then we'll determine exactly where we set this we can reach in behind. And do that plumbing after the fact. So we won the battle. And got the tub back in position gave us a little bit of a fight that's all right. So now we're just taking our brand new waist here. And we're going to throw a little bit of plumbers putty on there. Now this plumbers putty is awesome because it'll stay as a waterproof seal forever this stuff doesn't dry out it's better than silicone because a lot of guys revert to silicone nowadays. But silicone. And standing water will lose grip of whatever surface it's on.

So this is gonna be a demonstration for anybody whether you understand electoral or not you don't have to life is pretty simple electrical in home situations nowadays is pretty much it's. So safe it's ridiculous. So not having to understand everything about the electrical world to change a fixture is not necessary. But you do have to know every single step. And have the proper tools. So on the back of this particular fixture it has something called a strip gauge. And that's how much of the coating of the wire you have to remove because in this situation the wires go in the holes you tighten the screws. And then there's a plate inside the tighten is up to the wire it's like here's your wife it's not always like that sometimes it's more traditional this is for the ground wire we'll get into all this a minute. But you'd actually wrap the wire around it. So you actually strip more. So what you need is a set of strippers. And you have your gauge on here home wiring is 14 gauge almost exclusively. So you find the number 14 you back it up there lay the length that you need your pinch give it a twist. And it slides right off this is designed to remove the covering around the wire without damaging the wire all right you can confirm that you made the right cut maybe just a little bit too long the other tool you should have been doing electrical is a square end pair of pliers like this this is how got a great cutter on it. But it's also good for twisting your wires together i'll show you that the other thing is you're gonna want one of these bad boys power tester this confirms that what you're doing see that it means it's on. And it's ready to tell you.

And it's ready to tell you. And when we pull this off it'll tell us if the power is live. Now i ran downstairs. And i turned off the breaker. And the easiest way to do that is to turn the light on turn off the breaker. And see if the light turns off. And in most cases that means the powers off sometimes it means your bulbs burned out. So it's not a guarantee which is why it's nice to have one of these things. Now almost all light fixtures are attached with 632 screws. And that requires a drill bit number one robertson. But most of these screws also have a slot in them. So if the screw gets tripped you can still use a flathead screwdriver to remove it there we go i have no way to know if the power's on here or not. So i'm gonna lift the box straight up. And out. And there's my wires green light if there was power that would turn red. And would start to beep okay sometimes just on contact that happens don't let a freak out okay there's no power in here. So in this situation we currently have a dimmer switch all right. And we're gonna pull off our little moretz wow they're really on well. And you're gonna have one like this no here's what you're gonna know inside the box there are two white wires. And two black wires. So what's going on is we have a white. And a black coming from the panel. And we have a white. And a black traveling to the light the way electric circuit works is the white wire has to be continuous. And then the black wire when there's when the fixture is working is continuous. And this switch breaks that continuity. So when the switch is off the power can't travel through the black wire when you turn the switch on you engage the continuity. So then you can flow okay it's kind of like a a bridge being up or down traffic stops traffic. And move it's really that simple okay. So if you have a regular light switch. Then you'll have the power in coming to the bottom screw. And the power leaving on the top screw if you already have a dimmer switch. Then you're just gonna have a black. And a black. And it's reversible. So you don't have to worry about which one you use. Now we're done with this one get that out of here.

Now we're done with this one get that out of here. So when our switch today it is a basic dimmer. And you will see that it says top. So this is in the off position. And that will slowly bring it up to full power okay. And so what this is asking for is one black wire in here one black wire in here ground on the bottom. Now our ground is a little bit short. So we're going to start with that at the end here there's little jagged teeth just pinch. And turn. And it creates this beautiful little loop okay. And we can use that to put across our green wire. And then you can pinch the wire shut mm-hmm. And then you take your drill with your number one bit or you can use the screwdriver you don't have to have a drill for this all right. And now we're ready to go. Now my two black wires are both unique here because they've been twisted into place. And what we're looking to do is bring it straight. So we use our square. And pliers. And just in a couple of different locations. And apply pressure. And we straighten out the wire because it's a little short we don't want to just go cutting everything back. And starting over again all right the strip gauge these are actually in pretty good shape. So what we're gonna do is one wire at a time i'll start with the one that has the most flexibility push it right into the the sheathing on the wire it touches the back of the switch. And that's it done. And then this one here it doesn't matter which hole it's designed. So you could have multiple wires coming off the same switch there we go that's it. Now when you're putting your wires back into a box you want to pinch them okay. So there s curve you want them to have that flexibility. So when you push it back you have an s curve that's going to collapse. So to bend up. And down okay if you just have it straight out. And you push the buckle out the sides. And make all kinds of mess this is perfect this is our 632 screw i always start on backwards a little bit just to make sure that i hear that it clicks. And i know that the set the thread. So i'm not gonna strip the screws when you're changing a fixture always throw out the old screws okay this is not the strongest metal. And if there's any damage at all on it you run the risk of stripping the screw before you install it. And that just creates a whole lot of work okay because it is the new decorah design we need a corresponding plate because this will not work all right let me put this over top. And then you take a look do i like it is it big enough because you have an option you can buy different size plates especially to have an old house with plaster walls or somebody's done some rework. And they made a mess around the switch like this you can buy an oversize plate to cover up all those imperfections same thing that here that listen to the click right there. Now i know i can go forward okay finish by setting your screws up. And if you like this kind of information make sure you subscribe the channel know all i got to do is go back turn the power on.

And i'm at the church flip working on my plumbing for the laundry. Now it's a little intricate. But what i did notice is. Now that i'm looking at the santa flow system. And trying to tie my plumbing together i've made a mistake i've actually put a 45 degree angle here bringing my waistline out which is difficult because i've got to add a sweeping 90 on a waistline because that's code for us we can't just do a nice tight corner going across to the pump. So by the time i got that done i am wow seven inches off the wall what i should have done is instead of putting this i should have put this on right here at this joint. So my pipe would be nice close to the wall. So what i'm going to show you today is how to make the adjustment when you put the wrong fitting how to remove it. And how to install the new fitting on the same little piece of pipe because under here i've only got a not even half an inch of space. So i don't want to take the chance of trying to cut this off i've got to peel this off the existing pipe. So i'm going to show you how to do that all right first step grab yourself a sawzall with a metal blade we're going to want to start cutting where the fitting ridge is exposed because remember the pipe is right inside all the way up to this edge. So we're going to try to just cut this loose. And have a look there's the pipe this is the fitting. So what we want to do is remove the fitting from the pipe without damaging the pipe here's a little bit of surgery okay what i want to do is cut into the pipe there cut the fitting. But not the pipe that section. And then another section okay that's good pretty sure i got that all the way through yeah that looks good because i'm going to try to use the chisel. And force break that piece away it's not that difficult okay remember when we were putting this on we're using an abs solvent. Now solvent bonds two things together. But it doesn't melt them into one there's still two units. So you have the ability to work your way around here. Now i might have to cut a couple more pieces [music] coming loose see that off the pipe break another piece off there we go take our chisel. And we're just going to pry it all off all right. So now what we've done is we've exposed a good full inch of pipe which means. Now i've got options i can sand back a little bit of this  solvent ridge that's here. And i can attach my fitting right there if you try cutting right where that ridge is. And your saw is on a bad angle you might cut. So far into this that. Now you're stuck you have no more pipe left to connect to that means you're opening the wall. And increasing the scope of work. So when you're ever in a tight spot like that remember a couple of quick relief cuts get a chisel my hammer. And peel the fitting off the existing pipe for. Now let's just get on with trading on trim kits there washer. And dryer box is done it's nice to do the easy stuff first. And get a little headway right motivates you if you start with the hardest thing you're going to get the motivated quick. Now we're going to put on our dryer plug this is actually kind of easy because it tells you right on the box what's what this is the black. And the red this is going to be the white. And that is going to be the ground. So we're going to put the ground wire on first you see how this is working you got three connections here over here this is brass brass this is the ground. So we're going to connect the ground wire first. And then black white. And red nice. And easy all we got to do to do this. And don't worry the power is off okay i have a habit of never connecting anything to the panel until after i'm all of my connections are made. Then you just mitigate having a problem before we get started i'm going to pull out my wire strippers. And i am going to clean off one inch there we go for each of these other three colors let's get the prep work started before we have too much going on around here okay there's the neutral my ground first thing we're going to do is we're going to back out these screws until they're flush on the housing that makes room for the wire you'll go nuts trying to push a thick wire into that tiny hole give yourself some space make this easy for yourself all right here we go. Now we're going to get the ground wire on here. And i know it's probably easier to have a little more wire when you're working like this. But there's two sides of this coin having more wire also means that you've got to push all the extra wires in this box. And this thick gauge is hard enough to work with without having to complicate it by doing that [music]. So we're going to make sure that all of our wires are nicely tacked in. Now we're gonna use some decent force here okay this is not a time to have a loose connection foreign you want to bend the wire right here coming off the top of this okay to force that into the box okay how about you've got that s curve going on right nice. Now we're going to also remove all these screws because i don't like to work with. So much wire that i can make the adjustments i would rather add all my screws afterwards maybe these two we can do this way okay here we go let's see let me slide those in foreign [music] one two three. And four. Now before i go any further i want to just move some drywall or mud out of the way to identify the location of the screw for the mounting here it is we're going to be using 20 amp plugs because i have a 20 amp wire it's a little overkill. But because i'm putting the washer. And the pump on the same circuit i wanted to make sure we had lots of constant available power. And you can use 15 amp plugs on 20 amp circuit. But if we're going to do it you must just go to the 20. If a machine needs less power than what's available it's still going to work just fine it's okay to up your plugs if you have a 20 amp supply all right let's go the ground wire is connected inside the box we've got lots of extra wire just got to change out my bit on my drill. Now this is final location i got way too much wire here i'm just going to cut off my excess okay i'm going to strip the black. And the white if you get a pair of these you just look at the corresponding number this is a 12 2 wire. So i'm the third hole in one two. And three. And i want to get about an inch. And a quarter i pinch it it'll twist. And it pulls off that cuts the the sheathing without damaging the copper okay i want to get one of those. Now finish the tip. And put a curl on it corresponding other side same for the ground screw. So now throw on the screw tighten it in good i was just checking to see if these 20 amps have the quick connection in the back i'm glad they don't i don't like that look [music] okay. Now if you haven't seen one of these videos before,https://youtu.be/grwsRdN170k?t=0,"['What is a Santa flow system?', 'How do you remove a fitting from a pipe?', 'Why is it difficult to install a 90-degree angle corner?', 'What is the purpose of using an ABS solvent?', 'How do you prevent damage when working with tight spaces?']"

Now if you haven't seen one of these videos before the wiring connections are simple the neutral or the white wire is almost always on the same side as the ground if you want to know a way to know the difference like what's the difference between that side. And that side these are brass those aren't brass. And black go together okay that's all you need to know about this game. And there's four screws. So a certain come in. And out. And that brass tab connects the circuit from one screw to the next. And that is pretty much the dynamics of residential wiring if you understand that you're pretty much ready to wire just about anything okay always take your wire down with your thumb. And create an s all right that way it can collapse straight into the box. And not beside the screws. And then you set your screw into those little holes that the box gave you all right. And then you want to collapse come on baby into the hole do an inspection make sure you don't have any wires coming through the sides. And then you can just tighten up the screw. And we just take our cover plate. And stick it on. And then before you screw it on double check make sure that you can't see holes or damage. And if you do go buy one of these they're larger they're wider. And taller. And they can cover a multitude of mistakes these are 50 cents these are two bucks. But if you screw up that's the best two bucks you'll ever spend because that means you don't have to pull out the mud. And then do the sanding. And the patching. And the priming. And paint the whole wall again if you're in a gym consider using that cover plate i keep them on me at all times just in case i make a mistake. And i wasn't aware as things do tend to happen this is actually one of these is power to the box. And the other one is power leaving this box going to that other plug because the electrical code says that i can have more than one plug on a circuit in a laundry room i don't have to have just one plug for the laundry machine it can be on a circuit i can have three or four more plugs in the laundry room together. But only one circuit per laundry room. So in this case we're going to tighten up just a little bit okay we're gonna go with about six inches off the box all right. And here's why it's a lot more wires to jam in here. So i want to identify which one this is the ground that's coming off this is my power i want to take this one to the receptacle. And this one just wanted to go to the box little information,https://youtu.be/grwsRdN170k?t=480,"['What is the difference between the brass and black wires?', 'How do you know if a wire is neutral or white?', 'Why are there four screws in residential wiring?', 'What is the purpose of the brass tab in wiring connections?', 'Can you have more than one plug on a circuit in a laundry room?']"

And this one just wanted to go to the box little information about grounding when your wire comes in the box you want to have it come out right across the screw behind the screw. And you want it to come right to the plug that's overkill. And that's safe this screw or this metal bracket actually connects the ground see that here to the screw to the box. So even if this wire doesn't go to the receptacle it's grounded adding it to the receptacle is extra. But making sure that the ground continues means that this wire goes behind that screw okay it wouldn't hurt to have that all the way up. And around that guarantees that the wire that goes to the other box is also part of the grounding system when you're getting your electrical inspected inspectors are more interested with whether or not you've grounded everything in just about anything else it's kind of a crucial element for fire safety. So now we've got this ready to go we're gonna do the same thing we're going to strip them we're going to curl them. And now i'm showing this video because a lot of people want to know there are a lot of jurisdictions where homeowners are allowed to do their own electrical still get your permit. And before you go ahead with something like this make sure you're in one of those jurisdictions i know that most of europe australia i don't think florida allows you to do your own electrical. But there are lots of states. And provinces in canada for instance that do. So just make sure you qualify give them a call ask to open up a homeowner's permit what you need to know is how many devices you're putting in. And that's electrical jargon for how many boxes. So every slight switch every receptacle. And they'll charge you a certain amount of money per device the rough end for my laundry room was 68 bucks they opened the permit on the spot when your phone in all right i'm still old school i like to pinch my wire shut on the inside of that screw if i can get a hold of it okay here we go ah it's almost too easy isn't it okay. So again down. And then up auto wires create that s. And then push it back tucker in. And put a cap on make sure you're going square to the wall. So you don't cross thread the screw throw sorry it's usually the box that also gets threaded up. And it's hard to receive a screw again. So you can't just change out your plug all right nice wow i got some unique damage here. So i'm going to opt to go to the bigger plate just to make sure that it's pretty. And i'm old. And i'm already on the ground. And i don't want to have to get up just to get back here again here we go all right this is the larger plate doesn't look abnormal all right. Now on to the waist the vent. And the drain all right. So now we're just going to go through the plumbing here it looks really confusing right out of the gate. But what we need to know is just we'll just follow the water right. So we got water coming out over here for the shower is going to come into the santa flow unit. And i've got discharge water coming out of here for the laundry it's also going to go into the santa flow unit this one we're actually going to tee off. And connect to the vent okay this one has a fresh air vent system right here. And it's going to come up. And over. And then i have the discharge it starts like this we're going to bring it up put on our ball valve that way it's all under pressure. And then we're going to start the slope over to connect over there by gravity nice. And simple. So those are the connections that i've got to make we're going to weigh across connecting with the water my trick really is with this connection for the discharge i want to try to make the discharge come up right here in between these two boom. And that keeps all my electrical open. And it should keep things nice. And tidy. So i think i'm going to start with getting the first disc discharge pieces done. And the way this goes together guys it's really simple they give you lots of these rubber gaskets. So you can go from one. And a half to two or two to two or whatever you can seal up the ends with these okay because right. Now this unit comes with just checked valves it's just a little bit of a rubber flap sitting there water goes in. And it won't push back out it seals itself off it's. So straightforward it's not even funny it comes with directions follow the pictures. And you can't go around nice. And easy. Now this one here,https://youtu.be/grwsRdN170k?t=631,"['What is grounding and why is it important for fire safety?', 'Can homeowners install electrical systems in their homes without a permit?', 'How many devices are typically charged per permit for an electrical inspection?', 'What is the purpose of a vent and drain system in plumbing?', 'Why is it recommended to seal the ends of connections with rubber gaskets?']"

And you can't go around nice. And easy. Now this one here here's an actual check valve the water only goes one direction the gate opens when you put something in there. And it closes behind itself on pressure. And it goes right into the unit right at the very beginning. So we can't go wrong crazy thing that i had to deal with today because of our supply chain issues i couldn't get a pvc mario boy there we go. So this is a ball valve basically can shut it off in the event that you have to do service on this unit if you want to have this as close to the bottom as you can get just. So you don't have a whole lot of water in the pipe. So that you can disengage here lift this up. And won't make too much of a mess for. Now we'll leave it open it's not going to matter which way this goes in. So we'll install the handle. So it goes from flat to open hopefully i can get it right about near i'm going to start with the shower. And more work our way of going to the right i have to cut this pipe back. Now i'm going to go counterclockwise on this same thing there we go i'm going to use a sweeping 90 to get this close to the ground you know i am going to get a final inspection here for my occupancy. And generally speaking they like to see waist trains 245 or at least they're sweeping 90. Okay all right. So now i've got my angle i'm going to be directing this line towards that pipe you want to get this 45 in here. Now i'm gonna go three. And a half should have everything here okay [music] just to make things easy fitting on first. And then i can open this one here i always glue the fitting. And the pipe of course there we go. Now that is the shortest distance that i can work with here. So now i've got the ability to line up my pump. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to get a gear clamps out here have a look at what our options are we're going to break this up into medium small. And large most of these are four. And a half a couple of twos okay. So we're just going to line up our clamp tighten this on foreign start to gear up like that you know you're good to go here's another another gear clamp scenario here okay i'll set that one up i if you're a homeowner. And you're trying to put a bathroom somewhere you don't want to open your floor problem solution right this is plumbing for idiots i mean anybody can do this if i get this on here i'm not making that turn i'm gonna have to put this valve on going up somewhere up here all right. And that's fine. So let's do this we're going to finish connecting this pipe down over here. Then one. And a half to one. And a half two to one. And a half i guess that'll be. So this will be a two inch with the gear clamp oh come on watch that okay obviously this comes. So they can be modified this is a cap or it can be a connection here we go don't be afraid to be a little creative if you need to be remember the outside diameter of the pipe is what we're working with here. So this fitting is designed to go on an outside diameter of a two inch pipe. And that's what i'm bringing as my waste from the laundry. So if i got to modify this little end gasket here that'll work just fine here we go there we are foreign okay of course that yeah that's sealed up too i'll cut this end off as well. And i'll be ready to install the pipe,https://youtu.be/grwsRdN170k?t=878,"['What is a check valve in plumbing?', 'How does a ball valve shut off water flow?', 'Why is it important to have waist trains 245 or sweeping 90 fittings?', 'What is the purpose of gear clamps in plumbing?', 'How do you modify an end gasket for a specific pipe diameter?']"

And i'll be ready to install the pipe we're going to cut something short just enough for a gear clamp on each side we'll minimize our distance here great hack guys is use your cardboard for your drawing. And as the police to connect catch all your drips on your adhesive okay. Now this should fit right over that pipe like a glove it's just going to be easier to do it here yeah get the ring on first here we go okay okay all righty. Then there we go all right. So the connection. Now shower elbow 45 joint joint done this is the final resting location for this that's our electrical that'll work great we are going to put a short 90 here this is not a  a waste drain working under gravity this one's under pressure. So we're okay to have 90 degree short fittings here because the line's under pressure. And that is my location where i want it. So we're going to cut this pipe. Now assuming that this is a fixed location i'm going to go three inches mark with my thumb just trying to be careful not to get adhesive all over my new floor here. And if you're curious about how i'm installing vinyl flooring is a sheet roll gonna be having that video in the bathroom series you can check the video description for that link sheet vinyl is still a great option especially in laundry. And bathrooms in the house you don't have to make everything look like it was in a design book they're just last week you know you can be practical. And go with flooring that's going to last 50 years that's easy to install alrighty. Now i know i'm gonna hear in the comment section what are you using that teflon tape for there jeff that's. So thick that's supposed to be for gas lines like yep. But you know what when you run out of the regular plumbing teflon this is a great solution to the problem. Now this fitting is one. And a half inch male thread every threaded fitting in north america has been exactly the same since they started plumbing in the very very early ages okay they've never changed the size of that thread which makes it absolutely amazing. So if you have old pipes in your house. And you're converting all you got to do is measure the size that says one. And three quarters because inside is one. And a half. So all the measurements for plumbing are based on the inside dimension not the outside dimension in this kind of a situation okay. So this is a one. And a half inch thread for a one. And a half inch pipe everything that's on the shelf is going to be listed for either one. And a quarter one. And a half or two inch or three inch or four inch i guess too often you're going to get into four inch unless you're going underneath your concrete okay i'm gonna use my vice grips here all right confirm my office like that. So it'll function i want it about this high. So i'm. Now dealing with about eight inches foreign we're just going to rotate that we'll leave that there for. Now this is a waistline we're going to be bringing it up. And then a nice gentle slope back to this corner. So i made it in the bottom of that pipe is 37. And a half. So we're going to bring this one up to i'm going to go to 39 just because i know this floor is lowering all right. So 39 from 27. And a half basically 11. And a half all right all right because that fitting is. So heavy it's going to just be awkward for the next couple minutes here 's the rest of my pipe extension. And we're going to just put a regular 90 on this we don't have to go the sweeping 90 here again this is all under pump until after the corner. And we're gonna go heading over in the general direction this is temporary we're going to measure from inside the fitting to the end of this fitting we're going to find something easy to work with 34 33. And a half it's going to be really hard to accommodate. But 33 will be easy because i can move this. So let's go from the clean end 33 . If you haven't bought one of these yet make sure you pick one up sure that if you go to our amazon store we'll have a link just in case you're not close to a home depot or the store where you like to shop. And they're not carrying it it is a lifesaver for residential plumbing this one's more fixed. So i'm going to start here. And then we'll connect that together beautiful just making sure i'm not level. And i've got a downslope perfect anytime you see the bubble crossing the line you know you got at least a one degree slip. So that crossing that line is perfect all right okay this unit has to be vented okay which is why we established this that's what this is for this is the vent for the unit we're gonna have to go like this because of course i need two more of these things. So let's get this started because there is a dryer here. And the dryer duct is up here i'm going to be using a flexible dryer line to come over i want to try to keep all of this as close to the wall as i can. So my first piece of pipe that i'm going to cut is going to be just. So i can do the clamp i'm going to do a fitting we're going to get this bad boy in here we are not too aggressive nice. And subtle that's not high enough [music]. And we want to bring that over to this fitting to. Then go up the wall it's right here you're cutting a pipe like this if you add the fitting. And just think left to right if it's too long no problem it's easy to fix right rather cut a little bit longer. And try two or three times instead of cutting short the other thing i can do i can rotate like that solvent working here foreign okay. Now that we're nice. And close to the wall we're going to get one inch piece. So i can attach my coupling coming out of the pump over here. And these situations you are going to get this stuff all over you that's not a problem i'm going to line that up okay i'm gonna just dry fit this for a second it's going to take about a half an inch off for this here we go all right okay we're gonna just dry fit here. So we can get our measurement we're going to go with eight. And a quarter we're going to use as precise as we can on that eight. And three eighths okay let's do this says my eight. And three eighths nope that's the seven okay. Now we've got our waist in we've got our connection for the waist out. And we've got our vent for this pump the only thing left to do. Now is bring the waste over for our two inch series just before it goes into this pump i'm venting this line as well just to make sure that isn't going to have any issues with my inspection. Now this is what we call a bushing everybody out there who wants to know how to go from two inch to one. And a half you buy a bushing it's the same two inch diameter on the outside. And then it becomes a one. And a half inch fitting for the pipe on the inside that is a great solution to a lot of problems i'm going to put that here i need about a two inch piece of two inch pipe here we go well that one works better than my one. And a half i'm gonna get that connected. So we can stick that in we got one more two inch clamp around here somewhere that is going to be a serious problem  oh there it is oh thank god there we go okay i thought i had enough of them like surprised every second i was like no he's like that would have been a trip to the store speaking of which if you do run out or lose your ear clamps they do sell these at the local hardware store on half inch increments. And then one inch increments i think after you get to two inches okay there we are just remember when you're tightening that up you're actually compressing on the pipe which can bend. And then snap don't think that oh i can get a little more out of it it's not necessary okay we're just compressing rubber gasket up against an abs. But it doesn't need a whole lot. So we're done connecting everything into here. Now they do sell an alarm you can actually attach in here as well i don't have the alarm for this kit it's going to be out in the open. And it's going to be very visible if it stops running you'll know in a heartbeat because it'll overflow when you're doing your laundry what i'm going to suggest is get the alarm i don't have it on me today to install. But according to the pictures it's just a low box it sticks on the top it says hey you've got a problem with your ejection pump which could be a problem for your laundry if the alarm goes off you want to turn the laundry off right away too it would be nice if the alarm was also connected to the laundry power. So it could turn the machine off i haven't yet talked to santa flow to see if we have a solution for that. Now here's the vent for this one we're gonna go with a two inch piece it looked like reasonable [applause] we'll dry fit that give that kind of lines up yeah that's not terrible could be a little bit longer to be honest if you're not happy with something fix it before you move forward that's the basic rule of all renovation not happy don't move forward be happy with what you just accomplished before you move on to the next step or it is going to drive you nuts you'll end up going backwards. And doing everything twice okay here we are. Now we're going to dry fit this. And get a measurement inside to here i'm gonna go 15. And a half foreign here's why dry fitting is. So valuable because you do have about 30 seconds to a minute before this solvent is not going to be useful to you okay here we go here we are done. And done next up just,https://youtu.be/grwsRdN170k?t=1128,"['What type of teflon tape is used for gas lines?', 'How does the size of threaded fittings in North America affect plumbing measurements?', 'Why is it important to vent a pump?', 'What is the purpose of a bushing when converting from 2-inch to 1.5-inch pipe?', 'Can you explain the difference between using ear clamps and other types of compression tools for tightening fittings?']"

And traditional i constantly look online. And get inspiration from other people. And i saw you know there's a lot of silver. And i even have some metal in some of my accents. So i kind of wanted to you know bring it to the ceiling as well tied it all together. So i suggested she visit decorative seiling tiles. Net. And take a look at some of the faux metal ceiling options these tiles have the look of real metal. But are more affordable. And easier to install so lisa these are  the two patterns that you selected from the photos that i sent you what do you think of these i love them this one i love this one this one's my favorite well i'll tell you what i think i'm going to do i want you to see these actually up on the ceiling okay. So make your final choice i put some masking tape on the back of the tile. And temporarily attach it to the ceiling it's always was a good idea to look at it actually in position on the ceiling before you make a final choice okay you see the  the light it it actually there's a little bit more shadow up there it kind of emphasizes the the detail a little bit more i love it it looks amazing would you like the crown molding to remain white like it is here or to match the ceiling top yeah i think it should be it's better if it's white to break it up a little bit before putting the tile up we need to take a couple of things down down starting with the chandelier after shutting off power at the circuit breaker i disconnect the [music] fixture i also need to remove the existing crown molding first i cut through the sealant. Then use this specially designed tool called the trim puller to pry the molding [music] loose the first piece of rm comes off. And what do i find underneath another layer of crown molding probably installed when the house was built later we'll reinstall crown molding on top of the ceiling tiles hiding any cut edges these ceiling tiles are made of pvc plastic not only are they quite realistic they're also much lighter in weight far easier to cut. And more affordable than metal tiles. Now the first step in just about any ceiling tile project is figuring out the layout nearly all ceiling tile installations call for full tiles in the field. But cut tiles around the perimeter the idea behind a good layout is to determine the dimension of these partial tiles. And to come up with a border that is as uniform as possible on all sides you can calculate the width of the border tiles by adding together the combined length of the full tiles subtracting that distance from the wall dimension. And dividing the result by two. Now if all that mth seems a bit daunting to you well here's a technique you might try that uses almost no math i put some masking tape on the back of the tile.

So that  it allows your base basement floor the concrete floor to to move a little bit with you know if you're in high  moisture area or on  really clay land. So that you can  allow the floor to still move move a little bit up. And down without damaging the rest of your house you know pushing up on the upper floors buckling drywall that sort of thing. So basic the basic idea is that  you you frame your wall. So that it's tight to the ceiling. But it has about a 1 in space down below. So you attach a floor a a plate first to the floor to the concrete just like normal. And then you build your wall an inch shorter than it needs to be you. Then attach the wall to the to the ceiling. So it's hanging basically floating. So that there's a space between the two plates. Then we use a a nail here with the hole drilled through the bottom plate nailed goes in nails into the piece nailed to the floor. And that keeps your wall from swinging around moving around at the bottom. And as you can see it's actually very solid. And you know once you get the drywall in there it's even more more. So so the that's the basic concept  we see this a lot in the area that i'm from we've got to float the interior walls. And the basements the exterior walls you really shouldn't have to  if your floor is moving that bad on the very outside edge. Then you've got other issues. So it's generally floating walls only on the interior type walls. So you can see i've i've done a started a couple here just. So that you can see  what the basic idea is i've got another chunk of wall for behind me that's all framed. And ready to put into place. So that's m mostly what i'm going to be showing you today is how to actually position it. And get it attached. So i think we'll just cut here i'll get the wall kind of roughly in the area we want to work. And then we'll go from there okay. So we've positioned this 4t chunk of wall just roughly into the area that i needed it. And what i've done is i've just kind of got it wedged there i i stuck a piece of foam underneath that end just to slightly get it up off the floor. So it's a little easier to to work with. And i've got  you usually won't have this i have a piece of 1x4 here just happen to be in the right spot. And that follows the exact line of this wall. But usually you' just be,https://youtu.be/H-TXec0CQ8E?t=0,"['What is the main purpose of installing a floating wall system in a basement?', 'How does a floating wall system allow for movement between the concrete floor and the rest of the house?', 'What type of walls are typically floated, and why?', 'Can exterior walls be floated to accommodate floor movement?', 'What is the benefit of using foam underneath a floating wall to make it easier to work with?']"

But usually you' just be nailing into the bottom of the floor joist. So you'd have a chalk line or some kind of line mark there for your positioning.

And i'm going to fasten it in place. So that it's hanging. And then we'll get the bottom positioned. And fastened in. So i'm going to start over in this corner. And i'm basically pretty good there we're going to fasten that. And i'm just going to work my way along [applause] okay. So we've got the wall hanging you can see it's just kind of free floating there hanging from the top. And we've got our space obviously below. Now what i did is i went ahead went ahead of time. And drilled in this space i've got three holes drilled they're just basically the same size as these the diameter of these nails. And the the reason for that is. So that these this wall can still float nicely on the shank of the nail you want to drill those holes nice. And straight up. And down. And i'm just going to set these nails in there like that to get this started i want to line,https://youtu.be/H-TXec0CQ8E?t=184,"['What type of material was used for the wall hanging?', 'Why were three holes drilled into the space before installing the nail?', 'How does the wall hanging appear to be positioned?', 'What is the purpose of drilling holes in the same size as the nails?', 'What is the desired outcome for the placement of the nail?']"

And to the face of the plate. So i'm just going to get myself kind of lined up there you just want to hammer those nails straight down as straight down as you can through that hole. And solidly into the the bottom plate that's attached to the floor. Now you'll notice that i've got the nails longer than they need to be. And that is. So that we have some some room for that nail to slide. And move there if the floor happens to go down from the current position that's in a little bit at least it still can pull that nail down. And still keep the wall solid. So now i can just keep moving along i'll go to my next nail i'm just making these two plates flush. And again just hammer that nail in there. And the same thing all the way down the wall. So i've got one more left here just like that. So you can see i mean the studs obviously move that way. But there's there's really no movement back. And forth anymore than it would be if that plate was attached completely solid to the floor. So like i said this just allows the the floor to move a little bit without damaging the walls. So now what would happen  when you're when you're finishing this wall you're going to drywall the wall. But leave your drywall you know up an inch off the off the concrete floor. So your drywall is going to come down the,https://youtu.be/H-TXec0CQ8E?t=265,"[""['What type of movement do the studs allow for in a hanging wall?', 'Why are the nails longer than they need to be?', 'How does leaving drywall an inch off the concrete floor affect the finished wall?', 'What happens when you're finishing this wall with drywall?', 'Why is it important to leave space between the drywall and the concrete floor?']""]"

So your drywall is going to come down the whole face. But stop about an inch short of the floor that way the drywall doesn't bottom out either on the floor if it moves that much because that's that's what we're trying to prevent is it buckling. And then when you do your your casing you just need to make sure you or your baseboard i mean you need to make sure you're using tall enough baseboard to basically hide that gap what i also do is i'll because there's an inch space down here i'll usually add a little strip half about maybe a half inch high at the very most along the b very bottom against the floor. So when the baseboards on there sits flat it doesn't want to tip in underneath. So so yeah there's  that's the basic idea behind it  i don't think there's anything else i can really show you i'm going to be doing all the interior walls in this basement in this manner.

And it didn't close the hole gap. And one of them was a sliding panel it's pretty sexy had no true frame this one is the max revealed door. And it is basically a glass panel with an arm fixing it to the wall. And it has a two hinge point it's full glass it closes up against the gasket on the other side it's a very nice system. And it's very flexible for uneven surfaces. Now listen if you have a shower that's not perfectly flat or level this is a great door for you okay huh. So then we were just having lunch we were talking we got to do something different we thought let's do a 30 minute install challenge because a lot of times these projects take us two three or four hours to film because we want to get all the details in there. But i feel like this time around maybe we've got enough details in some of the other videos we can just have a little fun. So we're gonna just go with real-time door installation no fuss. And round alright. So without further ado we're gonna start the clock. And cut the box. And get to tell you never cut a box open like this with reality is the outsides are always covered in styrofoam [music] alright step 1 hardware gasket returns family plastics wow we got a lot of living in here other trims door sweep okay organize all your materials. So that you know where everything is that you're gonna be needing that is my return door from the other side that's for the other side of the door this is my track system for here there are two panels of glass ok my hardware kitten probably just the door handles here maybe the hinges as well yes door handle piston screws that's just a hinge kit ok. So then that means that the screws for mounting like this right here max gives you this awesome little screw driver reversible tips on it you just basically plug it in. And play this is really cool. So we keep those handy right up there we have huh this is for over there these little places with a glass there mounting screws roofer here three four here we don't need plugs because we actually installed wood before we got started. But i'm probably gonna need self tappers. And maybe one of those get all this crap out of here that's gonna be for later okay. So what you start off with this you have one basic mounting track the idea is to have it installed nice. And level garbage out the door as we go here sweet okay. So right out of the gate. So you understand how the system works it opens. And it closes okay that's the open position. And on the inside it has these little screw locations the self-tapping screws that come in the package are for there once you get your classes installed with the sealing gasket everything is tucked in it's in the right place it's level it's ready to go you got your holes drilled you tighten your. Then you tighten those screws.

So now we've got to decide which one of these is a fixed panel which is the door the fixed panel is gonna have no holes in it for the towel bar here we go. And there's the hinges who's gonna remove the extra packaging lovely. Now every one of these pieces of tempered glass have a stand one. And you don't want that being at the top. So we're gonna flip this over. Now being careful not to hit hey. And get rid of all of the packaging for sure that comes on the inside corners cuz that it's gonna go in here. Now now make sure you take care there's an arrow here that's up obviously never ever ever install anything like this or set it on stone or concrete acrylic is fine. So the shower pan is fine.

And you can cut it across. And you can install this. And it's designed to be a water deflection system. But the truth be told that if you buy a custom glass they never install these things i'll tell you why your shower pan has already got a slope custom glass goes straight on the acrylic they silicone the structural silicone okay they attach their hinges. And they move on with their life all they do is put a little blue tape on there. And say hey don't use this for 24 hours if it's good enough for the custom glass installers it's good enough for me. So we're gonna move right along on the next step bust open all these hinges let's get installing some doors okay. So there we go these hinges was it just means it hot in here my feeling the pressure pretty hey i got that yeah all right okay i like that let's see we got we got spacer we have left or right side cap let's get this straight top or bottom okay that's for right side door this is for left side door. So we need two of these careful with this because there's a left or right side the reversible option both of these are necessary for the bottom of the top hinge. And the bottom of the bottom hinge. So we're going to set these aside real quick. And we're gonna do both of the bottom side of the hinges while we have this open. So we don't get confused there's always additional hardware in a package it's your job to figure out after reading the instructions what you want to keep them like one i get rid of it. Now the package does call for the hinge to be installed with the loop on the inside the other door pivots here okay. So that's good to know. So we need both of those we're gonna do that. And that. And that. And that each one of these yeah. And i can't just put it in a bag right are you kidding me already yeah wow okay i'm gonna have to take five minutes just for cleaning off all,https://youtu.be/GlabzA8GbfA?t=788,"['What is the purpose of the water deflection system?', 'Why do custom glass installers not use this system?', 'What type of adhesive is used on acrylic and silicone in custom glass installations?', 'How many hinges are required for a shower door installation?', 'What is the correct orientation of the hinge loop when installing a shower door?']"

And also just. So that i don't think a fuse gonna take the wrong ones. And get them out of the room okay yeah okay wow 15 minutes already enters yes sir that just doesn't seem fair okay is where my handy-dandy screwdriver comes in okay. So this is the definite outside that's going there alright this. And then this that snap someone house snaps on to at these three four one go what screw [music] you know there is a little bit of flexibility with this. But generally speaking you want to install this. So that everything is is low in the glass as it can sit otherwise it's gonna settle over time anyway this particular system by max is wonderful work for some of them in the past work the holes for the hinges are rather large. And it's a compression fit to hold everything in place. And it's just a disaster because you're forever going back to a client's house or your own house for that matter. And then making adjustments on the panel okay. Now it's showing to have it like this there's a little notch here it rests in the hole the diagram is very precise as far as where as that goes come on baby is that the spot must be okay same for up here good. So it sits in a cradle that's nice okay not sure what that's for let's tell them how to put this in from underneath that must be after the pin goes on i love it good okay. Now for the tops all right no like i'm saying before this kind of system is going to have a ton of trims i'm going to keep them handy in case i find later that i have water issues. And i want to fix. But generally speaking all these plastic pieces they're just designed. So that people have the option to put them on if you don't use them you don't use them i prefer not to. And at least if you have an issue. And you want to fix it you can. Now here we have the same situation we have a door. Now [music] [music] yeah i'm putting that on backwards pressures getting to my bags okay i mean you're going to buy your product remember something important here your package is gonna say 60-inch door what is referring to is the size of the shower pan not this size of the finished home of the tile. So don't get alarmed if you measure your wall. And you have a 59 inch everything is standard in this world. And a few of us 60 inch tower pan you need the 60 inch door next one seriously i'm living my life just the pump hardware malfunction yep hardware malfunction wow that's just amazing again this thing isn't we gonna lose my mind okay you got it this time oh lord you've got to be kidding me no with my mind their egos your bleep that's the one michelle one the purpose of this stupid little black plastic thing here is to hold everything together while you screw it on. And if it doesn't do that. Then it's just in the damn way come on i can't spend twenty minutes putting on a frickin hinge yeah this is real world for you right how'd you like to be on a job like this one day summertime is hot i'm sweaty just trying to get the damn engine all right success finally sometimes i wonder if this silly screwed everything is even worth it separate ah it was my luck at this point i hope i even have the hinge on the right side of the door watch how easy this one goes on right this will be the joke. So work the first time no prob yeah okay wow that's amazing let's get this the heck out of here okay you want to line up the top in the bottom at the same time into the hole check your closure i'm good i have actually room to adjust that okay oh lord my plastic thinking them i get that back in everything that's why i felt funny okay here we go this is actually a device that's used to keep that door from popping off the hinge be install it. And these turn it a quarter turn. And now it's locked in there okay you know. Now we're going to use this to adjust the door. And send it over tours the back wall it takes forever in a date. And move it lease it's adjustable this store is also amazing if you're doing a tile over tile job because it will adjust all the way down to like i think 57 inches nice right there that's pretty okay i'm gonna get that where we want it yeah of course we can get it i'm gonna start looking at the other okay this is the same kind of thing installed level is 10 okay i just don't know how well that's gonna end up working. And i failed miserably is 30 minutes nuts okay. So here we go [music] very nice try to get that in there ii [music] yeah well obviously 30 minutes will be doable [music] [music] okay alright. Now here's the last piece of the puzzle okay this actually goes on the glass. And you want to squeeze together from both sides don't rub it up. And down you'll actually create a lot of heat. And you'll burn your hand okay leave the other magnet on there. Now peel this off. And make sure you install it in the track the same way you build it off there's little grooves on this i shouldn't be too difficult go from the top down alright. Now take our knife grab my pliers [music] i'm supposed to stop that did you oh nice really another gun here there we go love that pair of snips from crescent - all right too tight here. Now okay brilliant no oh we have left to do. Now just put a door handle on yeah we're a little out of alignment here. So i'm gonna actually pull the door back a little bit. So the magnet tightens up a little bit it'll be a good thing to do nice for the sole addition the packaging is do those over here somewhere there's the stabilizing bar boy i failed on this challenge miserable thing i think half the video is you just opening a package yeah well that's it right that's part of the deal okay. So this handle you'll see that it comes these little plastic slide glide issues. And all over the place. And it has a little insert that goes in the glass make sure when you install these things you get all of your plastic pieces on protect your glass from being in good direct contact with the steel okay. Now this handle actually has a great big handle that goes on the inside okay set that down get our plastic protection on here we go okay here we are going this all things up by hand. And the big one you can get a good grip on this right the little one has a hole in it when it comes with this little metal teeth hurry let me just slide that in there. And that's designed to give you grip. So you can turn that tighten that up here we go that's done yes that's interesting okay it seems to be missing the glass protector it's coming here good there it is that's not a piece of plastic here back off the set screw wait a minute i'm frickin kidding they give you all these screwdrivers. And then they don't even give you the right piece for this. So cheap okay let's get to some position you know there's seconds is a row hook believe it or not fancy little gizmo in it to make sure that that looks someone level tighten the setscrew okay i like him in that all right we'll draw two more holes for there we're gonna have to use the plugs because we didn't pump right there no way to know where the was gonna go on that wall [music] [music] [music] hi [applause] this is. So much we're drilling home above your head oh welcome to real life okay [applause] [applause] [music] [applause] okay whoo hey yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the wrong screws for that  thank you no use these okay give me a break here one second you get myself a real screw set come on we just had that set max any idea what happened to it where the heck is my right i have ours if you just try to find stuff well especially when they give you crappy hardware in a box right look who wants to use crappy harbour here we go that's what i'm talking about. Now that that's a plug all right [music] do these are phillips alright what stainless stainless steel hardware that comes with the package is what we're gonna use okay. Now that great big allen key that we have here we go let's try closing the door one more time we're gonna do this alright we're gonna loosen this until the door is closed top to bottom on my my gasket. And then i'm gonna tighten it up with the set screw nice. Now i'm going to back this up just a little bit because everyone's happy with how it was the line on the magnet yeah that's got a good fit brilliant alright the only thing left to do. Now is clean up. And attach these screws over here to get good compression on the glass well these are self tapping phillips. So there's already a hole drilled there are you kidding me that's not what those are for oh my bad these are just little mini set screws i gotta have on the right screwdriver there we go [applause] i'm gonna play it experience with other hardware. So i tighten the screw it causes this to compress. And i get more compression on the glass that makes a lot of sense actually there's a few of these down here. And that'll get the nice glass nice. And strong okay. Now i still have two of these strips one of these actually goes to cover all of these set screws alright just to give you a nice sleek look just snap it in you gotta be kidding me i just slide down okay pressures on that way there we go no i just say you know i don't want to stall one of these every day of the week. But ah my recollection of this program was it was a lot easier than this no this is ridiculous it's not gonna work it's got a snap in that's just stupid come on there we go yeah thank take the yellowknife all right. And then the bottom will just snip off cuz of it. So long way about a half inch all right. And then the other side that's where the screws are going. And self-tapping screws you know this trim here that makes a lot more sense. Then okay. And then this one just goes over town just want to snaps into a bear start at the bottom work our way up this time okay whoo no you like seeing me sweat like this hit the thumbs up button don't forget to subscribe. And if you don't do this kind of stuff it's a diy. And hire someone to do it no you know it's not as easy as it looks okay.

So i went to the store because i need a new lock from my door which we just installed. And if you didn't see that video you should watch that when you're done watching this one construction is very important before we get going listen there are a ton different lock companies out there different systems yep. And this is french here's english i don't care which one you buy ok read the instructions from front to back before you start these systems can be tricky. And there's a lot of little hints in here like do this with the lock open do this with a lot closed. And if you get it out of order you're in for a lot of headache. And then you're gonna end up calling this toll-free 1-800 number. And spending the rest of your day listening to elevator music waiting for someone to help you out. So we're gonna install this one. And the reason i got it is because it's cheap i love cheap things i'm a big fan that if i can get something for under 100 bucks there's no reason to spend 250 i like design. But in how much like this this is like modern rustic farmhouse right it's old it needs to be brought up to speed. But it doesn't have to be over-the-top there's no sense of us spending a lot of money on a lot of things that don't add value to the home. And then lock system is not one of the places i want to spend a lot of money let's face it somebody really wants to come in i don't care what you lock you put in that door it's coming up step one safety instructions -huh. And a whole lot of things that if you do void your warranty step two tools you need a screwdriver everything else is optional if your door only has one hole you're gonna need a lot of tools we'll go through those in the video if your door already has two holes in it. Then all you really need is a philips. And you can disengage. And then reinstall the new ones that would be easier. But i like to do it the hard way step three drill the hole in the door if you need one got it we need to drill a 208 inch hole. And we need to center it on the same one as that hole. And we got to put it a few inches above the other one good let's do that. Now okay. So here's your template this line is the edge of the door. So let's get that on the edge of the door let's crease it there. And find it good. And then we just want to pull this down. And line up that hole there got it. And then bam. So we're on this center line which is right here okay i didn't translate very well. But it was right there let's just confirm that. Now did it - i'm just checking my daylight coming through the hole good. And then good all right this is a tune in eighth,https://youtu.be/fxTG_K9Atcw?t=21,"['What type of lock companies are available for purchase?', 'Why is it recommended to read instructions from front to back before installing a new lock?', 'How much can you expect to spend on a lock system compared to other home improvements?', 'What tools do you need to install a new lock if your door only has one hole in it?', 'Can drilling the hole in the door yourself be an effective alternative to using pre-drilled holes?']"

And then good all right this is a tune in eighth i'll walk you bit it's a lot of fun most of these whole sub bits are very smooth on the outside this one they actually cut the teeth. And they put a little flair on it right where you cut is 1/32 of an inch wider than the hole they flare the teeth out. So that when you're drilling through metal the rest of the bit isn't overheating causing everything to expanding it locked onto the system it's really nice basically you can see that my bit my pilot extends about half an inch past my t's. So we're gonna drill for a little bit. And when i see the pilot come from the other side we'll switch around. And finish drawing from the other end safety note when drilling through metal always wear safety glasses even if you can't see what you're doing here we are. Now here's a tip of the day when you reach the middle put it on reverse. And push. And just score it first. Then put it on drive. And that little bit of score there will help keep all the teeth in line exactly where you want them in the kick. So make sure your hold tighten hey. And we're through the other side when you drilling from the other side i suggest you're a left-handed here we go put it on reverse. And just scratch it up real good first. Then go forward very important here let the drill bit do the work don't push too hard very satisfying.

So to mark the center of the hole that drill miss side you just put the center mark on this hole. And you'll take your template you line it up. And mark your centerline boom ready to drill nice. And slow make sure you get the hole in the center line. And then once you're happy with what you're doing it committed. Now you'll see that the teeth are gonna get clogged up with the wood fiber okay what you do is turn it on reverse that cleans the teeth. Then you can going forward all right no you can only drill. So far at a time. So what you do is you take your screwdriver put in the hole. And you pop that cord out. And that'll help keep things from overheating on you. And you just do that a few times until you get to the inside of the lock a [music] little bit of rocking motion helps make that hole just a hair bigger cuts down on the heat oh yeah that's what i'm trying to avoid. Now the cord broke off inside my bit it's not too hot okay we're gonna just take this off. Now because we don't want to leave the core in there there we go had i pulled out sooner that never would have happened whoo smokey yeah just keep been breaking off those pieces one more time.

And we're done okay that is the end of that demonstration. So step four is all about your hardware. Now it comes ready to go for a pre mortise store. So this store came off the shelf it smartest we can stick it in let's plate facing the door. So that closes. And it will shut nice. And simple a deadbolt we drilled our own hole. And it's sitting proud. And so they also come with the option of a deadbolt installation sleeve. So what we do we're just going to take our screwdriver put it in this little slot give it a twist. And the other side. And then this should just slide down a quarter turn. And i don't know sometimes they pop off the top sometimes they pop off the bottom looks like it's coming off the bottom done. Now they have the sleeve that's designed for this plate as well we don't need that we need this one for the deadbolt. And we will slide it over top okay snaps in place there's my dad bolt. Now on the assembly two things to note word is on the assembly it has an up sign in an arrow this raises up when you stick it in the hole. And then you have to set the depth adjustment for standard which is what we have not or the extended one. So what you'll find is when you stick it in the hole this slot here is right dead center okay. So if it's an old door you're going to want to shorten it puts a new door that'll be standard. Now nice thing to consider that. And we want to just stick that in there. And we want to hammer it with something boom with something hey that's what tape measures are for perfect okay. Now finish the installation of these two latches for the traditional plate screw do this all right. So the next step is the strike plate since we don't have our second hole yet we need to put our screwdriver in that slot open this up. And let's mark where that spot is there good news for us we're gonna be painting all this later here we go.

And we want to pick the center line of that translate that information make your mark. So this cute little piece of plastic is exactly one inch diameter i like my 1 inch spade butt. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna set this on the center hole drill ourselves a hole. And then insert this in the wood. So we can trace out what we need to mortise for our strictly. So the plastic turns out needs one. And 1/8 spade bit. So we're not using plastic i did just check the door everything works great the deadbolt sits perfectly in that hole. So now i'm just gonna trace over this as center as i can. And i'm gonna have to mortise this out with a chisel oh my whoopsie i don't think this is ideal. But if you buy a door off the shelf at your local building store you're gonna find that you too will need to chisel out your own mortise aggressive that's what i want there we go okay here we are alright once you get that chiseled in it's just a matter of lining up the screws remember always back it up. And burn it in before you drive it through that'll keep them splitting very nice. And here we go. And this is all pre mortise again can't stress. And how important it is it's real bad backwards first these plates your screws going with quarter inch from the hole karynda's guaranteed to split every time if you don't let's double check one more time nice i don't,https://youtu.be/fxTG_K9Atcw?t=580,"['What type of material was used for the center line drill?', 'How did the author determine the size of the mortise?', 'Why is it important to back up and burn the screws before driving them through?', 'What happens if the screws are not placed correctly in relation to the hole?', 'What is a guaranteed way to prevent screws from splitting when using quarter inch spacing?']"

And they're all screwed together on this plastic little doohickey seen this for a lot of years. Now looks great in the display none of the screws in this installation to the package are required for installing on the door. So get rid of them as soon as you can or they will drive you crazy make sure you put this in the right hole there are two options this is preset for the short depth this is preset for the long depth some assemblers you have to adjust them this one you don't you just slide it on in. Now it's impossible to screw together at this point without doing this. So depending on the design style that you get there is a release pin for these handles. And you can release this. And you could change your handle to something more curvy or if it's on a left installation. And you want to turn it to a right installation what you need to do is remove both handles from each side. And then just switch them around. And they'll just slide back into place. And lock in that's just a little something in case you need to know yeah for us our installation is pretty straightforward we basically want to set the middle of our handle over top of that square line up the two screw holes parallel at three. And nine o'clock. Now when you're putting in your screws use your fingers go backwards until you feel it catch. And then run it forward that'll guarantee you don't strip the threads it's a great time to remove the handle. So that you can do this. Now warning you don't want to go very fast here. And you don't want to over-tighten okay slide that on perfect bottom ones done okay. So for the locking mechanism make sure that it's perfectly squared off. And it'll drop in. And recess okay this pin can be adjusted here the secret with this system is keep this closed the whole time with this installation okay. Now you're feeding your wire underneath your lock set okay. And then you're putting this through the flat part of that bar. Now you generally don't want to be using the wire is your anchor. So use your left hand hold this all together this is where it gets a little bit tricky you know you have this plate. And it says i here against the door okay. And so it marked on here real plainly the cable slides through this little section that's great. And then that goes over the locking bar. And then there are two screw holes here that line up with the front. And these screws. And the piston like in the diagram says you know you slide that in you'll make contact again make sure you're not cross threading tighten these things on with your fingers first any screw that you can take when your finger is not cross threaded that is always a good way to know that you're doing it right okay once we got that all lined up just take them in the screws nice [music] okay before you tighten it up too hard open your door because it's a square plate. And visually get it where you want it okay. Now if you miss that step up you can always adjust the tightness on this later you don't want to be able to twist that with your fingers after you set that. Now in the instructions we have to install this electric cable one side is just pure white the other side has an orange bar on it. And that orange bar should be visible when you install it right up here it's just a plug-and-play system. So it should fit in the hole without too much difficulty of course it's gonna be really difficult. Now because i decided you should be easy. And just to make sure it's installed all the way i'm just gonna take my screwdriver give it a little bit upwards pressure nothing too major. But i don't want to be yanking on the wire to test. Now this wire harness is supposed to thread through this little grip right here set this horizontally slide it over top okay. And then there are two more screws to attach these two plates together these are machine thread. And they don't look like they're each oh yeah they do there we go there we go okay all four batteries let's put them in according to polarity okay. And enter the default master code one two three four five six waiting for a green light. And there it is haha we got it third. And that is that wow that is awesome. So we have keys step number one two. And three four for programming keep this paperwork set up your code you can have one master code. And you're allowed ten other codes the reason we got this is. So that when we're on holidays we can have our kids come by. And take care of our house in our dads. So there we go simple that was about as simple as it gets finally something that worked the first time. So make sure to check out all the videos on our modern rustic farmhouse remodel.

And i'm excited to get this project finished because next thing on my list at this church is to convert my two-piece bathroom into a three-piece make sure you subscribe to the channel. And hit the notification bell you're not going to want to miss that here we go. Now basket strainer. So i'm just taking my thing apart this is a hat gasket i call it a top hat gasket it kind of reminds me of it we got nuts here we've got to put our basket strainer on the sink that goes underneath this is very important there are two ways you can use these basket strainers okay one is you can stick it the gasket on the top part compression on the other side of the sink. And then use this ring to create that compression. And you seal it from the top. So the water never gets past that that gasket here the other way is once you've installed it underneath the sink you throw that. And then you throw that cardboard gasket on. So that when you're putting on the nut you get compression on the underside of the sink. So that doesn't leak personally i prefer this way i only use plumber's putty when i have to this means i don't have to. So i'm going to go with this here we go i'm going to get the sink out of here first because it's not installed yet i almost forgot guys i got a kind of guess as to where the middle of this is going to be because my shelf is in the wrong spot for my plumbing. So i'm going to just mark off where the center drain is there we go because before i put the sink in one i want to drill a hole in my shelf from my plumbing i want to bring the plumbing through the back wall i want to bring the water supply through the back wall. And i want to be done bringing all of those things into the space because i don't want to be crawling around underneath the sink doing all that work right let's get it all run,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=0,"[""['What is a basket strainer used for in plumbing?', 'How do you install a basket strainer under a sink?', 'Why do you prefer using a certain method of installing a basket strainer?', 'What is plumber's putty used for in plumbing?', 'What are the benefits of bringing plumbing through the back wall instead of underneath the sink?']""]"

And everything underneath this shelf. And connect it down there. So here we go. And we're gonna just check for resin we're good nice okay step one where's my broom i have my water my drain behind this wall. And i've got my water supply both behind as well. And it is 16 inches from that plug right there. So i'm going to bring these water lines both through here. And i've got shark bite 90s right let's take a look at this whenever you're doing plumbing you want to consider do you want to have your shutoff valve coming straight out or do you want it off on an angle here. And consider your faucet. So nice to have everything here open it up take a look before you go shopping these will connect right to my shutoff valve. So if i put both of these valves here. And one above it okay even though my sink is going in there. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to go left. And right. So that i got access to that we'll just go here [applause]. And then one here. So in behind this wall i've got my drain line running pretty much lateral coming across. So i'm going to bring it up on a 90. Stick that fitting on there. And then connect with my pipe to my drain inside the sink right here. So what i want to do is i'm good to come across at 21 inches that's my hole right. So i'm going to be basically going like this. But i've got to drill my hole where i want to have my lateral come through at a comfortable spot right considering the depth of my sink the depth of the tailpiece the depth of this. And then i have a conversion here my assembly is going to be a basket drain to tailpiece coming through here. And i've got this fitting here that is inch. And a half it's designed to go on the tailpiece okay that i just cut a piece of pipe to hit the right height. So my life is nice. And simple just a piece of abs to finish that off. So the lower i go the more convenient everything is. And the better it'll drain actually because because it's coming across. So low i want to try to keep my entrance through the hole nice. And low. And i like to make the hole as big as the outside of the fitting not the pipe just in case in the future you got to make any adjustments you can cut it off. And put a coupling on or something like that okay here we go all right. So 21 from the plug is perfect that's just to the right of this line. And then this. And this coming across they mostly fit the same height. So i'm going to just go down here. And drill a height something like this high okay a couple inches off the ground i'll just set it on there know my spot excuse me for a minute while i crawl into the abyss there we go okay okay. So here come my water lines. Now where we're from the hot line comes through on the left. And just to make life easy i have one type of pex. But i put electrical tape on the hotline. So i can identify it. And there's my call because i'm going with sharkbite you know i'm just leaving this connection undone for. Now and. Then later on i'm going to make the connection on the back i'm just crimping with solid copper rings. So i've got everything kind of prepped up i'm pretty much ready to go i needed my clamps for the sink there we go they came with the sink you know what else it came with a basket strainer. But it doesn't matter how pretty it is look at this plastic tail piece plastic clamp plastic plastic plastic everything here is freaking plastic it's like it's like plastic. And metal it's a hybrid okay this is insane i wouldn't use this i'm my worst enemy the gasket i'm going to save it's good to have a plumbing kit for another day. And this is a really nice gasket for the seal it's actually it's a better gasket for this because it'll compress. But this one won't. So get standing water setting in the bottom of your sink. So i'm going to steal that see this has got a nice deep well with a food trap little basket look at this this is adorable. But i'm not going to use this i don't want to ever use anything plastic that has to be under compression. So that's all going in the garbage we're going to use this one that doesn't fit this i've got my own which is also a strainer okay at the end of the day give me metal threads okay like give me brass hardware this is the kind of stuff that i want to work with not this cheap plastic stuff give me a metal tail piece all right oh i want my things to last when i put them on all right. So i'm pretty much ready,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=130,"['What type of pipe material was used for the lateral line in the plumbing installation?', 'How far is the drain line from the sink plug?', 'Why did the installer choose to use SharkBite fittings instead of other options?', 'What is the purpose of using a conversion fitting, such as a basket drain to tailpiece assembly?', 'What type of material was preferred for the metal threads and hardware in the plumbing installation?']"

So i'm pretty much ready i'm just going to do a little bit more prep here. And that is on my p-trap all right i have two places where i want to use a little bit of teflon teflon always goes on clockwise okay. And the reason we use it is it is a lubricant. But also a sealer all right plastic on plastic abs fittings don't get the greatest seal. But the minute you add some teflon tape to that joint you make it 10 times better at keeping from having leaks all right. And we don't have to tighten it all the way up yet just get in the neighborhood have it ready to go okay. Now when we go to assemble lickety-split we'll be done my faucet comes with this plate it's kind of cute. And handy yeah if you're making a conversion from an old one to a new one you can use this all right this will go underneath the sink sorry this one goes on top of the sink. And it'll cover if you have an old three-hole faucet. But again garbage all right what else we got in our little box of surprises here this is the weight for the pull-down hose. And this is something else i probably need to read the instructions okay. Now the challenge here,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=486,"['What type of material is used as a lubricant and sealer on ABS fittings?', 'Why do you use Teflon tape on joints in plumbing?', 'What happens when you add Teflon tape to a joint?', 'What is the purpose of the plate that comes with the faucet?', 'What is the weight for the pull-down hose used for?']"

Now the challenge here is put the sink on. And it's a pretty deep well i think it looks like a nine inch yeah we'll call that nine. And plus that. So i don't have a lot of room to work with. So there's a few different clip systems out there. And we're going to basically want  as many of these installed in advance as we can. So they slide on. And then they won't come out all right trying to find the position for all these locations after the fact is difficult. But at the same time this particular sink it has a location with one of them from underneath i can go in slide. And then i can lock. And tighten got the gasket i got a strainer it's a one piece boom it's installed we're gonna try to put this little symbol there at the top it doesn't get much easier than that does it. And then we have a locking nut [music] all right. Now we want to put channel locks on here okay. And give that as much compression as we can comfortably give there's no chance of damaging anything here because it's metal on metal instead of cheap plastic fittings god why people sell things that encourage it to fall apart on you i don't know. And we drop it in right. Now one thing i'm missing is it doesn't come with a gasket the old days whenever you had a top mounted sink we would always use plumber's putty or they would serve you up a gasket i'm bleeding how about that all right. And you just roll this play-doh out you don't need a whole lot because it's all pretty flat. But what you want to do is you want to make sure that around the edge of your tile you're going to have your sink set into this okay. So roll as much of this up as you need. So that when you tighten up your sink you're compressing down into the gasket. And then you don't have to add silicone around the outside of the sink afterwards which always looks horrible. And traps dirt. And then after i'm done compressing it you know i'll just scrape off the excess it's not going to hurt anybody. And put it right back in the bucket for next time roll this out. And then lay up the run around the entire perimeter of the sink it's going to be perfect all right. Now i'm going to crawl underneath here put in all the clips i'm gonna have to just  rely on my sense of touch here reach back. And identify that clip i find it easier i just knocked it right out of the track well that ever brilliant wow i think what i'm going to do is i'm just going to demonstrate up front okay the  the power of this little bad boy here okay all right there we go there's more than one design i'm not a fan of whatever the hell this is you know this is part of the problem you have to buy whatever is on the damn market at the time i'm not familiar with this brand if i had known these clips were this frustrating never would have freaking bought this crap i gotta hold it in place while i try to torque it this is a problem this is one of these moments where you guys get to learn from my mistakes this hardware is garbage it does not give me the ability to get enough compression to actually compress this gasket to get a good seal. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to take it all apart get rid of this plumber's putty all together i'm going to have to put a bead of clear silicone on the tile. And then set this into the silicone not the way i want to want to work. But i don't have an option because this is keeping me from installing the sink nice  just for the record,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=583,"[""['What type of clip system would be ideal for this deep well sink installation?', 'How does the manufacturer's design handle the positioning of clips in a confined space?', 'Why is it recommended to use plumber's putty or gasket instead of silicone around the edge of tile?', 'What is the purpose of using channel locks and how much compression can they provide?', 'What are some common mistakes made when installing a sink with clip systems?']""]"

But this is my favorite silicone of all time it's made in guelph ontario cheers canada  one thing you might want to know if it doesn't smell like vinegar it's not really good silicone okay there's a lot of crap being sold on the shelf for nine dollars a tube that ain't worth 250. Okay good stuff stinks that's how you know the difference all right. So what i'm going to do is just prop it up. And seal it from here you know one of the funniest things we got in the market we get. So many products coming from overseas. And you know canada actually supplies china with a lot of coal. And it's not for making energy it's for making steel they do have one of the lowest quality steels in the world. And so the hardware is just garbage well at least it's cheap right okay gotta get this started before you oh oh yeah that's my favorite thing of all time right there four is good enough let the silicone do the rest of the work all right. So i've checked the instructions we're good i think i know exactly what i'm doing here this fed through the hole. And it's going to want to go like this hot. And cold this particular product is from glacier bay  i am just getting occupancy permit this thing is probably only going to last a year or two whatever i'm fine with that again this is going to go over all those pipes right up to the stem. And you're gonna push. And turn. And lock everything in place. So at least that's a really handy design i'm just not gonna be able to see anything about what i'm doing here it's just designed big. And fast. So you can stick your hand on it. And twist it in okay i got it i just can't see what i'm doing. And i'm behind a nine inch sink this is why i'm saying it's not going to last long because there's just no way to get in here. And get a proper compression that ain't terrible i'll tell you that right. Now see if i can muscle up a couple more turns that right there was a young man's game all right okay this is a quick connect thank god goes to this back here done that one's marked hot there's my electrical tape. And it has a gasket. So i don't have to worry about anything else i'm just going to put it on here hand tight. And then i'll use a pair of slip joint pliers okay we don't need a lot of strength here. But we're gonna go until that gasket gives me some resistance. So i know it's engaged there we go plenty finger tight is not tight enough okay. So even with my vice grip hands that my kid's saying i have all right that's tight by hand quarter quarter three quarters full turn. And a quarter all right there we go that's that this is the weight that must be what that does okay. So i'm gonna set this over my pipe yes definitely good to pick the right side okay. And then i'm gonna log it over top that's kind of actually not a bad idea. So now it'll sit up. Now time for the tailpiece right on okay. So brass nut top hat washer okay right up to here all right. And then this slides on underneath we'll use that on the white washer the reason that works is because the pipe itself is like this. And the washer is the big white nut is on the outside. And the inside on the inside is flared. And so it just really creates a lot of compression every time you turn it it just triples the strength every quarter. So you just got to give it a couple of shots that's good. Now all i got to do is measure the height from my abs to my p-trap okay. So i'm going to hold this up to where it comes through the wall. And then from the shelf to my abs inside the pipe you can see that max i'm reading that at nine. And a half. But i want a little bit of slope. So i want this a little bit taller. So i'm going to go with nine. And a quarter minus from the shelf to the top of this fitting nine. And a quarter minus one. And a quarter which it makes at night eight ah we'll see if i can know my math at all here i love to do this on the printed side because there's eight is just after the barcode i don't have to make a mark there's a tooth in here just line that up a little crack just next to the barcode there we are i'll do a dry fit see if we like that [music] yeah that actually is perfect line that up. So it's pointing straight back. Now so before i can glue anything i've got to make a measurement. And a rough end for this one as well all right you want to be careful not to go to glue too quick here we want to measure to the fitting we're going eight inches plus i'm gonna go in eight inches plus a good half an inch for the depth of the fitting. So we're gonna go with eight. And a half all right here we go again eight. And a half is right there okay [music] all right. So am i roughing that all right. And i'm gonna rough in that. And then see if all of this twists together. And it does perfectly okay all righty that's what the cardboard is for because this glue can make one hell of a mess. And it's a painted surface that's actually only a couple of days old because we started this project just like four days ago from repurposing. And cutting down the cabinets to painting them to building the countertop installing everything on top if you haven't seen the series you can check the link below start watching that right from the beginning there's a lot to learn in there that can help you remodel your kitchen save a ton of money. Now remember i didn't lock that up that gives me the ability to fuss around a little bit right. But i don't need to have too many joints that aren't glued remember when you're gluing glue the pipe. And the fitting it's a solvent. So it melts things you want to melt them both there we go. Now i've got four things to put the solvent on this fitting that pipe this pipe. And that fitting we're gonna hit all four at the same time. And stick it all together [music] there we go we'll get that out of the way. Now you don't have forever to do this. So here we are. And there we go okay. Now that's all good i'll make sure it looks kind of square. Now i'm going to,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=874,"['What is the recommended method for installing a sink?', 'How does Glacier Bay silicone work?', 'Why is Canadian steel considered low-quality?', 'What is the purpose of using electrical tape and gaskets in plumbing?', 'How do you ensure proper compression when connecting pipes?']"

Now i'm going to tighten up that bead trap or just finger tight though okay if you tighten it too much you're going to make the pipe oval. And then it'll leak a lot of people get leaks in their pipe. And their first instinct is to tighten it up. So you should actually relax it put on some new teflon. And then tighten again just go hand tight check for leaks. Then just to note when you're doing water testing there's an every every joint that you made is a possible leak. So take a piece of cardboard or some paper towels or something stick it underneath the p-trap okay because what you're going to want to do here is a two-stage you want to turn the water on first to the faucet hot. And cold all right. And don't just connect just the cold or something. And then test the faucet this is a mixing chamber. And it'll come back out the hot water line. And cause a flood just to note what you want to do is two things first we want to just set the the cold water. And just let it run a little bit okay just the cold you're gonna want to run this for like 15 or 20 seconds it's gonna have air in it because we had to bleed the lines look for anything that's obvious first check the the basket the collars all right the first inspection you're making is to make sure that everything is glued together properly. And there's no obvious major leaks yay we passed that test. Now we want to overwhelm the drain system. So you plug the sink. And then you're going to want to fill it up with a few inches of water okay this water test is a little different this one is going to overwhelm the system to make sure that all the gaskets that are in that system are under compression. And are sealing things up properly come on honey stop complaining there we go we got all the air out. Now yet i love the smell of sulfur before i use this kitchen though i've got to put a new water system in we got to put in the purification yeah. And maybe turn the pump up a little bit put a little more pressure on the line what do you think can you imagine trying to fill up a pot of water here to boil past or something you'd get you'd get old before you got it done. Now we're going to double check everything again make sure that the gaskets are good we're going to pop the drain. And overwhelm the system. And see if it leaks anywhere else that might be the first time i've ever done that. And didn't have a leak all right. Now the third test. And this is the big one if there is a place in the compression fitting where the teflon is sometimes it can take 5 or 10 15 minutes before the water finds its way around all of that. And starts leaking. And then you get a slow drip. So now you put it on the cold water. And you just let this run okay i can't even tell you how many times in my career we would do a water test first. And second stage. And not do this we go home. And then we get the call on the weekend hey the sink is leaking. And so take the time make sure you're not going to have a drip a little bit of water causes a lot of damage especially on a painted wood surface if it's left unattended all right cool and,https://youtu.be/vln5rN9rqR8?t=1458,"['What type of material should be used to replace Teflon in a pipe?', 'How long does it take for compressed air to escape from a pipe?', 'Why is it recommended to test the faucet with both hot and cold water?', 'What happens if the compression fitting leaks during the water test?', 'Can a slow drip from a leak cause significant damage to surfaces?']"

So first thing is first you got to figure out how bad the situation is. So i'm right on the ground this is a 24 by 80 door it's very standard off-the-shelf my gap at the top is a little bit too big which is great because the reality is is when i lift this door up leaves me a little gap at the bottom. So our height it really isn't quite enough that would be a good gap underneath the door. But i don't even have enough space for on top of the door not to mention swing is everything level. So when i look at the bottom i'm also sitting on a marble sill that's on the slope. So i want to add a little extra,https://youtu.be/noancs9-MX8?t=89,"['What type of gap is typically desired between a door and its frame?', 'How do you determine if a space has enough room for a standard off-the-shelf door?', 'What are some common issues with installing a new door in an old space?', 'How can you ensure that a door swings level on uneven flooring?', 'What type of material is often used to fill gaps between doors and their frames?']"

So i want to add a little extra space. So we're gonna cut down the bottom of the door okay that'll give us the extra space that we need at step one step number two side to side i'm really tight okay. So what i'm gonna do to solve that problem is i'm gonna take out my hand planer. And this is a simple tool that i keep on the truck because every time i run into a situation with an old door. And it needs to be fixed i got a plain one side. So that i can get the room that i need to put a fresh cake job on. So because i don't want to start making the the hinge side thinner because these are hollow doors. And you don't want to mess with the integrity strength of where the hinges go we are going to take it off of this side. Now this door fits pretty good. And traditionally what you want is about 1/16 of an inch gap here. And about 1/8 over here we've only got the 16 going on. So we're going to set the planer to 1/8 give it a quick rip. And then follow it up with a quick little sand.

And then follow it up with a quick little sand. And then we're going to be able to drill the holes whoo. Now the thing about using a hand planer on this side of the door is once you start you can't stop you don't start in the stop in the middle or it's going to get ugly. So you have to be able to commit to doing the whole line. And then that'll give you a nice straight edge look just like a factory cut. So first thing we got to do is get this outside get out the tools get the planer cut the bottom. And then we can come. And measure for our hinges the first thing we need to see is that the door has got a bevel. And what happens is when you're swinging the door open. And closed the shorter side of the door okay that's the interior of the jamb. And the wider side of the door that's the exterior of the jamb. So that will help you to set this up if you're putting it in backwards you're in for one heck of a challenge we only need a quarter inch off the bottom. And a solid eighth off the side this is my planer has one wheel with a couple blades incredibly fast moving machine. And this table here actually adjusts the the depth to cut more or less alright. And that's all there is to it. So we just got to set this to what we want. And i'm loving that. And then make sure that i can do this all in one pass all right.

Now you can see my height at the top much better look at beautiful gaps down here oh yeah no this is really close. And it's possible when we're completely done that when we try the operation of the door i might need to set the planer on something like really tiny just to do a little bit of custom curving at the bottom. But for. Now i think what we're going to do is we're going to go for it. Now when we put this door in we saw that the gap was very consistent across the top that's really handy if it's not. Then you're gonna want to scribe the top use your planer. And maybe a hand belt sander. And just get that perfect curve. But that's pretty extreme. And usually an applicable with houses that have like stacked stone foundations. And that sort of thing most situations how should sit pretty square. And that won't be an issue. Now we did go out.

But all you have to do is measure it from the top down to here. And this one in this case wow we're gonna call that six. And a quarter we're gonna mark that in because what i want to do is i want to get this hinge cut in. So i can put it on the pin. And then i can actually fix the other one perfectly. So what i do is i take to my hinge side. And i mark down here. But it don't go six. And a quarter go six in an eight. And here's why i'm setting my door intentionally a little bit lower because i've got a doorstop. And i want to have a bit of gap here to make sure that i don't have rubbing. So measure this side translate that information - 1/8 put your pencil mark. Now this particular hinge it is about a full quarter away from the jam all right from the doorstop sorry. So when i translate this over onto this side if i put this hinge flush. Then i have the door stopping a quarter inch from the doorstop. So what i want to do is i want to come over here. And i want to add a full eight here okay. And i just trace the top. And the bottom. And then down the side alright. And that leaves me with the cutout for my hinge. So all of this. And i'm going to try to leave this which is good because this is a hard board on the wood. So if i'm just taking the wood out only i'll leave the hard board actually get the right depth set. And this is something that you can do in your house all you need for this is a basic chisel. Now traditionally my chisels aren't in the greatest shape simply because i don't use them often enough to baby them. And when i'm on site i tend to trust. And rely on caulking to finish some of my finishing trims here well i'm doing this just setting the depth that i want to take out. Then i want to use my knife to separate the wood from the melamine the luan in the front here. Now over the years the wood that had been using these doors is i'm getting worse. And worse order okay if you have a really good chisel this one's actually not that bad. So you can just slide it along if it's good otherwise you need a hammer all right. And the secret here is to try to not take out more than you need we're gonna backfill it back filling it with a little pieces of cardboard like the old sixties carpenters know if you're gonna bring this thing towards you gotta be careful because remember if it's that sharp you can do it without a hammer can you slip this is gonna go right to the bone anything that cuts wood that easy trust me it's not stopping until it hits bone. So be real conscientious about where this is gonna go off the slips how this work is tricky the high board panel doesn't work as nice as would i would suggest using a hammer here okay no we do as we set our hinge here. And see how we're doing i'm still a little proud okay. So we're gonna take a little bit more all right. Now we're nice.

And in today's video i'm going to show you how to use  this product here for attaching new posts to the floor. So this is a is the bolt that's going to go in the floor. And it's made by zip bolt. Now we're not sponsored by them they didn't give us any product or anything it's just a just a product that i found that works really well. And secures the posts easily to the floor basically it's it's two pieces. So you're going to have the stud here that's going to go down into the floor structure there's going to be this much of it sticking up out of the floor. And then this little  i don't know what you really call this this little cam is going to slide into the hole in the post which you'll see me do later. And then it's just got a drive gear here. So you can just stick a socket in. And tighten it down. And the drive gears actually thread it down onto the pole. And draw the post down tight to the floor. And you'll see you'll understand it more when we actually go to installing it. But we'll throw a link in the description of the video as well to the zip zip bolt okay. So the situation we have here obviously we've got a stairwell. And there's going to be railing along two sides of it pretty common situation in a lot of houses. So before the flooring is done we want to get the poles. And everything in place. And today's video is just going to be about how to machine the poles for this bolt. And attach it to the floor something that we need to show you is the structure that you're going into which we can't see from here. So we're going to go downstairs in a minute. And show you. But basically around an opening like this there should be depending on the age of your house there's going to be either two floor joists or a truss system around the floor for structure to be able to attach into. And that's what we're wanting to attach into is down into some actual solid wood you're not just attaching to the plywood floor here or anything like that that'll never hold your your new post for any amount of time. So we need to get down into the structure. And preferably we don't want to thread this down in between both those two by six or two by tens or whatever the floor joists are because that isn't going to hold as well either preferably we want to be in right into one of the floor joists. So you need to lay out your your post position according to that. And hopefully you've got access in your basement or crawl space or whatever under the house to have a look at what you've got for structure down there. And where exactly you need to be. So maybe we'll go downstairs. And have a look at that,https://youtu.be/ENAuKBymI4I?t=0,"['What type of product is being used to attach new posts to the floor?', 'Who made the bolt mentioned in the video?', 'What is the purpose of the cam on the bolt?', 'How does the drive gear work with the socket?', 'What structure should be attached to for a stairwell railing?']"

So maybe we'll go downstairs. And have a look at that okay. So in this house we've got  an unfinished basement. So it's easy to see the structure. So if you look up top here we've got  two by nine a two by tens i mean  for the floor joists. And you can see right here there's actually two on each side of this this is the staircase coming down. So we've got the drywall here that we kind of seen up top the edge of it. And then you've got two two by tens which are each inch. And a half wide on each side of that opening. And they run all the way down. So we're gonna have a post the first post we're looking at is right in this area well above here. And the other one is going to be it's actually going to be a little bit past this wall. But still into these joists that are here they're going to those joists are going to run right down there for a ways yeah they run about two feet past this wall okay. So i just wanted to show you the structure. So this is what you're looking for down below is some good solid wood not just you just don't want to drill it into plywood that's gonna be no good. So you want some good solid wood to be able to thread that zip bolt down into okay. So we've seen the structure below here. And right here you can see this is the drywall we're looking at the back side. So we've got the drywall coming up. And then we've got our our two inch. And a half framing structures right here okay approximately there's going to be one there one there running all the way along here. So you need to position your post in a spot like i said. So you're not drilling right down between them hopefully. So i've got myself. So i'm i'm sitting about a half an inch or 5 8 of an inch into this outside one. So that should be good. And i figured out my spacing of my posts. And all that sort of stuff according to how the layout was gonna be. So that's gonna that's gonna kind of depend on your  your layout of your stairway well. And stuff. So there's no point in me talking numbers. So figure out your post positions go. And mark what i like to do is mark out the square my posts they call them three. And a half these ones are actually about three. And seven sixteenths square. So i marked out my my posts here that's the s solid full post. And there's another one here i know there's a lot of marks. So hopefully it's not too confusing on camera. So this is the square here. So once you have your squares the easiest way to find center is just mark diagonal lines corner to corner where they intersect is the center of that square. So that that's the position where i'm going to drill down i want to pre-drill to insert that bolt. And i've actually done it already here i've drilled the hole. So for this anchor it calls for a 3 8 hole drill down first just. So you're not putting. So much pressure on the joist you want to pre-drill it. And there's still wood there good meat for these coarse threads to thread into. So the key thing here when you're drilling it is to start out right on the center point of that intersection like i showed you down there. And you want to drill as vertical in both planes you know what i mean like straight down you don't want to be drilling on any kind of an angle. So you want to drill straight down as deep as you can basically when we put this in we're going to thread this into the floor right until these coarse threads along the bottom disappear. So we need to pre-drill in this case about five inches down into the floor okay. So i've already done that. And like i said in this case it was a 3 8 drill bit  when i drilled this the first time i was using a spade bit. And a couple inches down i ran into nails or something. And i buggered that spade bit up right away. So luckily i had a twist bit  same size. And i finished the hole out. So just be prepared you might want to have a couple bits on hand because that that beam down there is going to be all nailed together. So okay. So to put this on i'm just going to just to make it easier i'm going to just thread off this top cam. And we want to start it into the hole. Now i had this bolt in. And out once. So that's why it's going in kind of easy. But you're going to want to put a little bit of pressure down on it. And actually i guess if you left this on that would help you push down on the bolt while you get it started by twisting it with  use a big crescent wrench if you use a short little wrench you're gonna have a little trouble because it takes a fair bit of torque to get this down in there. So i'm just going to move this back. So i don't knock it over. And i'm going to thread this bolt right down into the floor. So there's a spot on here on the shank that's flattened out to fit a wrench. And i'll just get it going here if it's really tight you could put some a little bit of wax or crayon on the threads. And it will help it  thread down easier like i said i had this one in there once. So it's actually going in easier than it normally would. So you can see the threads disappearing down there at the floor i just want to get it down to where they just kind of disappear right at the floor level somewhere right or out about there. Now if you look at that stud it looks like i'm on a little bit of an angle going that way. So i can just take a hammer or i might even be able to bend it. And i'll need a hammer i'll just don't tap on the threads here tap down here just straighten it up a little bit the hole in the bottom side of the post is going to be a little bit oversized. So you have a little bit of play anyways this isn't too bad. But i'll probably just tap that over with a hammer just to straighten it out just a bit okay. So that's that part we're gonna take the post over where it's easier to show you. And work. And i'm going to show you how to drill the holes into the post because we need we need a couple holes in here we need one up through the middle of the bottom of the post. So it'll slide down over that stud. But then we need access in the side of the post to slip this in. And get it started on top of the stud. And then there's a wood plug that'll go in there. And cap that off okay. So we'll take this over to the counter there. And work on it okay. So we,https://youtu.be/ENAuKBymI4I?t=173,"['What type of structure can be seen in an unfinished basement?', 'How do you determine the center point of a square?', 'Why is pre-drilling necessary when installing a zip bolt?', 'What happens if you drill into plywood instead of solid wood?', 'What is the purpose of using a twist bit to finish a hole?']"

And work on it okay. So we just came over here where it's a little easier to work. And i've got one post already drilled. So you can see this is the hole that this this cam would go into. So we would set the pole down on the stud slip this cam in get it started on the threaded portion. And be able to tighten it up. So we need to drill an inch. And a half hole in there that's about  in this case for me it's going to be two. And a half inches deep. But depending on the size of your post that is going to change for you. And we need to also drill a 5 8 hole straight up again as straight as we can up through the middle of the post until it intersects with this bigger hole. So obviously that's the one that this stud is going to go into right this is sticking up out of the floor it's gonna go in there we're gonna drop the cam in get it all started. So hopefully. So same thing as i did on the floor there to find the center of the square i just marked diagonally corner to corner. And that's how i determined that. So i've got this one marked out you can see i think you can maybe see my pencil marks on here. And i used a punch. And marked the center. Then i measured up the distance i needed here in my case i'm using five. And a quarter inches there's actually. So this product is a zip bolt. And i did find some literature online right here that explains some of the measurements. And sizes that you're going to need. So it's probably just as easy just to print off this page. And or take a snapshot or a screenshot of this. So okay that'll explain some of your sizes. And your distances. And stuff. But in my case i was coming up five. And a quarter inches in height. And i'm i'm in the center of the pole here okay this is  i don't know if i showed this this is the little cap that's gonna go in the hole after. So once we're all once i'm all done i put a bit of glue on this. And just tap that into the hole okay this  depending on what you've bought it may come with the with the bolt in my case it didn't i i bought it separately. But i've seen them packaged together as a set. So just depends okay. So i'm going to use i'm going to drill this big hole first. And i'm going to use a inch. And a half forstner bit. So this drills a nice clean round hole with a pretty flat bottom on it whatever you do you definitely don't want to go too deep you don't want this little point here or the the entire hole to come right out the other side okay. So i i want to go about two. And a quarter inches. So i'm going in to center plus a little bit extra because this when this cam's in there it's in there like this right. So i've got to go past center. So i figured out i need two. And a quarter inches which is basically on my bit from here right to the shoulder deep. So okay. And these cut pretty reasonably well. So now i used the tape just to mark out on. And i center punched the intersecting spot. So i'm just going to peel that tape off. And there's a there's a point on these bits. So you can get it right where you wanted it to start. And i'm going to drill that hole. And again you want to drill as vertically straight down as you can or straight in [music]. So so i'll just knock that excess wood chips out of there. And give this a measure. And yeah i'm right at two. And a quarter. So we're good with that hole. Now that bottom hole they recommend that that's a five-eighths hole we used three-eighths into the floor if you remember because we want the threads of the bolt to to  secure into the wood around it. So it has to be smaller than the bolt this hole we want the bolt to slip right through. So it needs to be just a little bit bigger. So with 5 8 that actually gives you enough size for the bolt to go through plus a little bit of wiggle room. So you have a little bit of adjustment on your post location just in case you aren't completely centered. So again i'm going to  into the bottom of this as straight as i can. And yeah we'll see what happens it might be easier actually for me to put this post on the floor drill downward okay. So i'm i'm using a 5 8 spade bit just pull out a couple times just to get the excess dust out of the way okay. So i'm right through let's get that dust out of there i'm a little bit off center once i got into that hole. So i'm just going to have a look. And see make sure this is going to go on or i might have to deepen that big hole a little bit keep forgetting these are reverse threaded well that should be good because i dropped down yeah i should be good. So i'm still all right. So we've got that all machined. So we'll go over. And put this one on okay.

And put this one on okay. So we've got our post over here at stud. And we've got our little cam. So we should be able to drop this down in there get things kind of lined up okay i've got the cam started i'm just positioning the pole getting getting it square. And onto my lines you've seen i've had this red line here which is in my case the outside of my post. And i had the square marked on the floor that represented the position i wanted the post. And it looks like it's going to line up. So just kind of hand tighten that to start with. But yeah the nice thing about these is  you know it's easy to to do to tighten this down there's other systems out there where you've got a little nut you gotta balance. And get in there. And then you gotta use a wrench to tighten it. And it's just not as convenient as this okay. So we got that on there. And that's that's good. And solid. And we should be good. Now the only other thing that you would want to do as you progress along in this project is  putting a level on here to to make sure it's plumb if it isn't what you might have to do i'm not at the point to worry about plumb. But when i am what you might have to do is put little shims here there you could use thin washers as shims or wooden wooden shims underneath the base just to shim it up as plumb as as you need it i'm not sure what it looks like from that angle from this way it actually looks pretty good i don't have my level on me. But like i said i i'm a long ways from  in this project to worry about if it's exactly plum. But you will need to okay. So hopefully that made it a little more clear as to the process of figuring out your post your new post positions. And how to fasten them securely to the floor  this quick bolt product makes it pretty simple really once you get all the the posts  positioned. And drilled.

And get professional results today we're talking about installing prehung doors that's right we've got three different ways to do it stay with us we're going to show you all of our tips. And tricks [music] all right bow before we get started today if you're new to our channel. Then i would encourage you. And invite you to subscribe to the channel hit the button in the corner. And don't forget to hit the notifications bell it's very important otherwise you aren't gonna know that we got new videos out until it's way too late okay. So we will get right into it today we are talking interior doors in all my years. And renovations i have seen a ton of different techniques some of them work some of them don't. But there are three out there specifically that are great for diy homeowners because you get a good result in all three different instances. So there are three techniques that i'm gonna show you today the strongest the easiest. And then the cheapest okay. So we're gonna start with the strongest door because this is like bread-and-butter door hanging okay if it's solid core or hollow core it won't make a difference this technique will hold your weight. And it's basically old-school right we're using a level to plumb the frame we're using a square to make sure everything is nice we're using wood shims we're using long screws basic typical kind of construction style right alright. So what we want to do to get started is take our prehung door apart alright you know what do they got here oh we've got a new system holding this on there you go. Now leave it up the manufactures to be forever inventing new. And stupid ways to try to put these plugs in there we go. And then you have to pop your pins there we go okay let's get rid of our slab for. Now we'll go back to that in a minute just because the doors prehung doesn't mean you want to leave it on the door frame while you're working yeah not a lot of mercy here okay. So let's just talk doors real quick because you want to have an idea what's going on this is a thirty inch hole rough opening wood the wood. So we got a 28 inch door traditionally jams are 5/8 thick which gives you 3/8 of an inch which is just a few millimeters of mercy if it's not level or p.m. So what we do put this up against the frame with your nice long five six foot level. And now i have to almost go all the way over to the other side in order to get that plumb that's just great. So now we want to check over here see what's the condition of the door if i wow. Now if you're building it for yourself leave yourself the full two inches don't cheat inevitably this is what happens. So now i'm over here tied up against the wall we we know that from that corner to the top of this i have to pull i'm twisted in the frame. Now and this has just enough room i'm gonna have just a hair to pull the jamb off the wall at the bottom who we're lucky that was close if it doesn't fit the hole you've got to take your slab grab your portable planer you got to resize the door to fit the hole that you're stuck with. So make sure you frame your holes big enough fortunately on this job we kind of picked up to clean up somebody else's mess halfway through not my favorite way to work. But it's a great learning opportunity. So what we're gonna do in this situation is we. Now know that our door will fit it will be plumb. And there is enough room. But you also want to make sure that you're level at the bottom. Now if you have a shorter level it could be beneficial here let's check. And see what we're looking at this is sinking on this side all right. So what that means is we're gonna take a shim. And we're gonna prop this one up why am i talking about it let's just show it i'm in the hole relatively square. And i'm just getting started right. And i know that this is really low. And if this is low that means this is not gonna be square. So if i put my right. And i can lift. And it's square. And about a quarter inch up. So we're gonna just drop this on the ground we're gonna use this to space it until i am really frickin happy all right. So there's. Now i got my spacer because we're in here all twisted i need 14 hands again i'll keep it in place. Now there are a couple different ways to do this guys.

Now i have no reason to assume that this is gonna be frame plumb no it's not if you take shims from two different directions. And you pinch them together in the middle of a door like this. And you're gonna get a nice square door you only come at it from one side you'll twist the frame all right. So very important wherever you can come at it from two different directions all right throw your lay on your level. Now this is funny because the levels usually made.

And the idea here behind why this is. So high up it's because it's comfortable i'm getting old. So this is where i'm standing right i mean this is not rocket science i do want to get a shim pack near the top just to help stabilize this because what happens over time is if areas like this aren't taking care of really nice. And tight. Then they'll move around. And that's where your door will end up jamming up. So we're gonna just make sure nice.

Now there's just a couple of goals you want to get here you want to get your jam flush with your wall okay across the top as well. And at the bottom. And you want to get this plumb you can check the work with your square. And it should be pretty dang perfect just a little warning here this is actually dangerous. And when i scar on my hand from doing this one day yeah i cut the shim. And held it like this. And i snap the shin i don't know what i was thinking right through my hand that was interesting at the hospital. So i drove by grab myself a coffee at that at the coffee shop on the way to the hospital because you know in canada you're gonna be sitting there for a while we don't have no hospital with a sign outside saying guaranteed five minute wait time for us it can be three to five hours. But thank god it's free i guess that's our consolation prize all right anyway i get to the hospital. And they had paramedics there doing triage that even all kids from school. And because i use my electrical tape to close up the window. And i was able to walk up. And undo the electrical tape. And open up my hand. And they got to see the inside of my hand another good reason to use an electrical tape because they always want to diagnose the problem before they put you into a waiting room to get the treatment i was able to take my tape. And just wrap it all back up again to keep it from bleeding beautiful here we go. Now this is where this gets interesting. Now that you've got the hinge side of the door established it's plumb it's flush its square everything's good you hang the door again. And then you just fish just this side to make everything fit. So even if you're a little bit out of square a little bit out of plumb once this is established you hang the door you can move this around to do whatever you need to do to make your door look pretty. And that is the best diy technique you can get. So if you'll excuse me i'm going to hang my door. And then put my pins back in your pens will go in relatively easy. And if it's not you'll know because you won't be able to get your pins in here we go. Now how we do i just close the door. And see how she fits. And i'm looking for flush right when i close the door i want it to hit the top. And the bottom together. And it looks like this corner of the building is twisted. So we're happy with the gap at the top. And because i'm gonna be manipulating the door frame at the top afterwards here's the secret guys if your stuff isn't nice.

And level you can always take your knife cut back some of your drywall that's gonna be protruding okay. And you can actually trim it out thanks such okay. So when you put your casing on it's not. So aggressive we have raised up as a bump all right. So you can actually put your case in there trace your line cut your drywall back a little bit. Then nail your casing on you can fake that it was flush sometimes it's just nothing to play ball. And you can spend all day long adjusting everything about your house. So that it works perfectly where you just learn how to do things like this. So you can adjust things on the fly. And get on with your life remember the goal of doing renovations at home it's not to spend your entire life i fixing your house getting it done. And then enjoying the rest of your weekend i think three is really good for frames a little twisted. So i'm gonna do two from this side there we go that's better okay yep too thick.

So feel free they give yourself a little bit extra space there we go. But make sure the door stop closes the gap you want to have privacy when you're the bathroom after all. And someday down the road they're gonna spend some money. And get the rest of this renovation done. And this space will be a bathroom just not today [music] ones for me decide again. And i like to put these close to the latch set all right just. So that you get a nice solid feel when you're closing the door hey. Now we got something worth talking about okay you know don't forget you know what you're working with is never going to be square. Now we're gonna be straight things twist twist. And bend see a little bit of pressure here. And i got a bow. Now if i don't have this here at all it's actually already bowed. So what i want to do is find out where it's snug it's just how you get rid of a bow in a door. Now pull your shoes back. And then push yeah. Now she's straight okay here we are the reason i'm putting the screws. And behind the door stop is because visually when the doors closed you can't see the repair this is nice. And clean. And open nothing on the surface paints really well. And this is like an mdf for the prime runner. So that's where i like to hide them back there if you like. And you have the opportunity take the stops off that's great - it's just a whole lot extra work. And if you're working in your basement you're putting up eight or nine doors have any way to get this done. And get on with your day is not a bad plan instead of drinking to break them off feel free to just cut them off mm-hmm okay all right there we go that wasn't too bad that was pretty quick. Now that's the strongest door system. And the reason we call it the strongest is because we are using construction screws look at that that's a nice gap i got three of them on each side. And that gives me 500 pounds of sheer strength. So when this doors closed it's gonna take a whole lot of energy to kick that sucker in which really shouldn't be your first goal in a basement if you like to build things that stay put that's a great way to do it. Now the next way we're gonna do it it's gonna be the simplest way to do it mm-hmm you'll be able to see the difference all right door number two we're gonna do the quick. And easy way. And this cost a few bucks i'm gonna warn you both of the major hardware stores had a version of a similar system the idea is just a metal bracket you screw to the doors first of the wall i can hang it boom you're done not quite as simple as you'd like to think. But for 13 bucks if you don't want to get involved. And if you're working alone. And you're not familiar with hanging a door it can be really quite frustrating this may not be a bad investment i have never used this system before my life. But i had a another door video on our site that was going through the process. And somebody said hey you want to buy the clip system. So much easier. So i decided that buy the clip system. And try this if in theory looks really quick. And simple. And i love the concept. But we're gonna see if it's as easy as the package suggests all right. So same process i don't care what system using the hanging door you need to know if your floor is level because you're building off the floor i already checked. And it is fine. And in this system i got two different kinds of nails or screws sorry lovely oh my god that coarse thread drywall screw that's what we're hang on the door with better than the fine thread i guess. So this is gonna take a minute we've got a lot of screws to install here i didn't say this is the fastest just the easiest. So wait we do this let's get the door turned around all right. And we're gonna attach one of these brackets yeah let's make sure she's gonna play ball we're gonna put it yeah let me just show you the bracket boom boom boom. So it's got these little teeth okay. And it's got an adjustable screw here. And it's got this plate here the idea because you screw it to the jam in these three holes here okay. And then you put a screw through the surface into the wall that you're attaching the door -. And then the casing will cover all of this hardware seems pretty simple in theory.

So let's get this on you suggest that you install these at each hinge. And the corresponding on the other side. So that means it's 24 screws that you have to install to put a door up. And this might be easy to do by yourself. But i don't know if it's gonna be necessarily the fastest that's for sure you really want to make sure you put your screw. And the farthest part of the hole before you start. So you don't accidentally stick these tabs out is that it's gonna interfere with your casing. And it's ultimately ultimately gonna affect the finish look number thirteen fourteen. And fifteen screws. And i need a third hand again because they're a phillips screw which is lovely it's. So easy to work with phillips screws they always want to stay on the drill bit after a solid half an hour of screwing the clips on we're ready to go here we are. Now again i put a shim on my hinge side you've got to be kidding me oh whoever frame this house needs to get some mild correction people in the comment section telling me don't complain about what other people do. But then they do things like this. And you want to just hit them like this yeah if you make the hole the same width bottom middle. And top you will have success hanging doors alright i think this might actually fit the hole. Now let's give this a shot again for the first time there is one thing we're missing it's one thing i did in my brilliance is i forgot that since i'm installing this i wanted to put the pins,https://youtu.be/ph2YCh85NQ0?t=1016,"['What type of screws are recommended for door installation?', 'How many screws are typically required for door installation?', 'Why is it important to pre-drill holes for screws?', 'Can a third hand be helpful when working with Phillips screws?', 'What is the purpose of using shims in hinge installation?']"

And right okay check check your gap across the top of the door if you don't like the gap pull the bottom away from the wall ups you can if you got some room that looks pretty good i'm liking that i'm thinking we can install the door there this looks like an inch inner in the inch-and-a-half grill i'm gonna pull this nice. And tight. And because there's force to go that way i'm gonna put the screw on the outside of that gap okay whew. Now when i check this. And i line it up my gap is bigger here i'm gonna close this gap by rotating the door i'm sending the bottom side over here on the hinge i'm gonna send it over. And the more i close it see that the more i send it to the bottom the higher that goes it's like rotating on that one screw. So yep.

So i'm going to set the screw on the inside of the slot once i get that gap establish all right. So i make my life easy i put that screw right in the middle. Then i can get up here.

Now i'm all set up it's just a matter of finishing off the last few screws i'm gonna put my thumb on the jet you see i'm gonna got the ability to open that up just a little bit just a little bit there we go same down here that opens up a nice little gap okay nice.

So that was rather effortless it doesn't require a lot of strength didn't require a lot of knowledge of carpentry just took a little bit understanding we've got to be on a finished surface a lot of screws relatively easy installation you know not a bad product for diy or not listen that took longer than the first door that one also costs about ten or twelve dollars for the hardware keep that in mind alright i think it might be worth it to learn how to use a construction screws in the shin all right this is method number three this is what i call the cheapest because no matter what you do when you install the door when you're finished you have to use brad nails to put on while you're casing what if you could install the door completely with just brad nails.

And room on each side for the casing as well because you can't custom scribe your casing. And then install your door that's just ridiculous that's totally backwards. But if you have lots of room like we do here because we bought 78 inch tall doors just a tip. But if you have working in a basement. And you're working underneath structural beams. And ductwork in a lot of cases if you buy the 78 inch door instead of 80 it'll give you room to may give the appearance of a full size door. And you won't have to be cutting all of your trims down save you a ton of work gives you a cleaner look as well. And it gives you the ability to install your door this way.

And then we're gonna lift it up stick it in place throw 20 nails in that sucker. And call it a day we cut our casing. And now we're gonna throw something else in it of course we're using 2 inch nails you just throw a couple in the bottom here set it up with a bit of a gap. So you can. And paint later make it all pretty ok did you do secret does it get to the other end on the door without stepping on it. So now we got our casing attached the jams are still gonna be moving around. So don't nail your corner give that some flexibility of course i took that little locking pin out of the door handle area we're gonna just drag this into position yeah this looks a little awkward okay. Now the door will want to fall in. But the casing is gonna keep him from doing that. Now what we want to do is just get our level put it on the hinge side right. And make sure that the door can open.

So what we're doing here is we're going to just start pushed up on the bottom against the framing of the door okay there we go. Now you can see i've got some room to manipulate here what i want to do is put my level here check for plumb i'm not plumb go all the way that's a little too extreme. So what i know is that the bottom is going to be in that position. So let's get the jam on a couple in the casing a couple in the jam. Now the bottom is fixed. Now i can sit here set my gun. And just relax until it's in the perfect spot. And i'm putting all my nail line right where the doorstop is because i can come by later. And with a with a caulking gun. And i can do one bead of caulking. And fill in all those little dents right where my group is gonna be okay. So now nobody do is come over this side check for functionality. So now again i'm in the same place i have lots of flexibility here okay up down moving around i'm just checking my gap across the top i'm good with that close the door i don't see any light. So i get this nice. And square. And then i can just manipulate everything here until it all closes nice. And i'm not getting any rubbing i'm gonna pull the shut a little bit here there that's a nice gap all the way around. Now i have a gap from here to my frame.

So scary. And i'm gonna hold the jam material in place on the left side knowing that this is all nailed on the right side to keep everything from twisting it's pretty solid that doors not going anywhere loving it we're probably gonna need a little bit of caulking just to clean up some of these cuts. But let's be honest i know a lot of carpenters are out there that if they got a joint like that with cheap mdf materials they'll be just happy with it knowing they're gonna cog it. So as a bare wire whoo we got a bit of rub let's fix that wow perfect this is a great way to maintain a door system anything ever moves or pulls around on you over time you know we just give it a little kick throw a couple more nails in it you're good to go. Now that covers all three systems the cheapest turned out to be the most tedious. But if you're comfortable with using a miter saw. And measuring. And slapping them together like this. And your holes the right size this is also pretty quick what i would suggest is if you're a door slammer type family this is not a good system for you unless you got casing on both side. But since it's just going into an empty room where we have the furnace really all we need here is something that we can paint. And close off our gap. So visually we can't see the furnace room. So that works great my favorite of course is always shims. And screws let's just review i'm not a fan of the clips i thought was just a whole lot of screws. And at the end of the day it took more effort to install all those plates. And get it all squared off than just doing it the original way with the ships. So three ways you get to pick i think those screwed plate system it would work if you're really not comfortable tools all you need new is know how to use a drill. And the rest of it you can just feel your way through it. So it's probably not a bad diy project if you don't have a lot of comfort with it. But let's just say old fashioned still rules this will work not a big fan i don't do this do a kind of door very often at all. But for the purpose of the video i just thought i'd throw three different options at you. So you can pick strongest the easiest. And the cheapest the cheapest actually ended up being the fastest.

So you know take the time plan your  light positioning out  we've got this one marked right right here. So it's all basically ready to go. And i'm just going to drill it. So i've got my hole saw i've got it in the drill you could take the tile right down cuz this does produce some dust. But i'm just going to see if i can do it right in place better throw on some glasses i just went nice. And easy. And slow just. So it makes a nice clean hole does create a lot of dust okay. So now what i can do is  reach up in there. And hopefully just pull those wires down. So we can re work on it down here one here's the other one okay. So we got both our both our wires down. So when you get your  most of your pot lights there's going to be  some type of a box on here for the electrc to be housed inside of  also something else to consider is if for some reason you've got a ceiling that's insulated or you know you've got some insulation in there for sound barrier you need to make sure that you've got the  proper  can light that can be next to insulation in our case it isn't a concern there's no insulation up there. So i just took the   the little cover off there this one has the moratz rate included with it we're going to find that there's a black white. And a ground wire inside there. So that's all normal. And then there's going to be some locations on that box. And a few spots that you can pop that little piece out which i've already done on this side. And install the wire,https://youtu.be/dBQJdFxn-Ys?t=105,"[""['What type of materials should be considered when planning light positioning in a room?', \n'How do you determine if wires are in the way of a hole drilled for a pot light?', \n'What is the purpose of taking glasses while drilling through tile?', \n'Why is it important to consider insulation in ceiling construction when installing pot lights?', \n'What type of wire should be used next to insulation in a ceiling construction?'""]"

And install the wire clamp okay sometimes you'll find  when you pop that little piece out especially on these lights where the box is a little flimsy there's some little tabs on this one it be right there there. And right there. And that's where it's kind of spot welded on there when this is in there you just stick a screwdriver in that hole. And bend it back. And forth. And twist. And that until it comes out. But sometimes those little pieces there don't break off real clean. And they jut down in the hole too far. So you may need a a round file just to clean those up a bit to make it easier to get this the little wire clamp in there i think this one's going to be all right maybe kind of tight. Now that i said that. And i don't have my file right here these ones looked pretty clean there we go okay i got the little clamp in there just turn it. So i can get out the the screw part that tightens it up. And we can get my screwdriver handy i'm going to feed the wires in there i'll just loosen this off. So there's more than enough room for them both to go in.

And this is just like any electrical when you're sliding the wire in through a clamp like that we only we want you know no more than a/ quar inch of the white insulation here showing inside the box. So this is a pretty small little junk function box hooked on here. So it takes a little bit of maneuvering to get them all in i'll just get it in there. And and tighten down. And then you can see i'll show you better what what's going on. So you don't need that super tight just snug enough that you know can can hang there without pulling the wires out. So up in there you can see coming in the top are are our w wires that we need you may only have one you know 142 wire. But in our case we had two like i explained before. And you can see i've got about an e/ inch or maybe 3/16 of the white outer shield  inside the box. So wish this would just kind of hang that way. So you can see better okay. So now because of the way our wiring is this is really simple we just match the colors up  i i don't know i always like to do my grounds first. And then i tuck them right back in the box. So in this case this one has like i said the green wire which is ground already attached to the box  the odd light you might find just,https://youtu.be/dBQJdFxn-Ys?t=341,"['What type of electrical connection is being demonstrated?', 'How much white insulation should be visible inside the box?', 'Why is it important not to overtighten the wires?', 'What are the two types of wires used in this example?', 'Why does the author prefer to match colors before tucking them back into the box?']"

So whatever whatever your style has i'm just twisting these two grounds together a bit just to make things easier i'll open up my rs that came with the packaging these should be big enough size to inc case all the wires that i've got okay. So i just hold the ground wire up against that one just give it a little twist with my fingers around the ones the bare wies i twist it together okay just give that a little tug make sure it's in there. Now we've got a really small  junction box like i stated. So just take a little bit of time get get this all folded back in there nice. And out of the way. So we have as much room as we can in that box for all the other wires okay. So i got the ground all in there. Now the white s or all the other wires really i just simply do the same thing. So i'm going to take my whites. And just twist them together i'll do my blocks while i'm at it this just makes a nice tight connection when you can twist those with the pliers it's kind of hard  most lighting comes with  stranded wire. So it's kind of hard to actually twist it in there with the solid ones it doesn't usually work well. But if you can just take it. And lay it in beside them. And get the morat on. And it usually works out all right okay. So those are on there. Now it's just a matter of getting everything tucked back in here like we did with the grounds i don't know why this has to be. So small trying not to kink them too sharply kind of difficult okay. So we got everything tucked back in there no be wire showing on the black or the whites. And we can put this little lid back on here just kind of closes everything up okay. So that's your junction box for all the wiring. Now on the housing itself as far as what holds it in there's a couple different styles you'll find this one just has these simple little clamps. And to get it up in the hole i've got to get them inside the housing like that when they're out like this that's what it would look like when it's up inside the drywall or the the ceiling tiles in this case these clamps come out. And and clamp down tight to the top side of the drywall to kind of pinch it in there the other style you're going to find will basically have some screws way up in there. And a little clamping system that would slide there's usually two that slide on each side. And you just simply tighten or loosen that screw depending what you're doing. But like i said these ones this is a little simpler version  although they can be a little bit finicky to  get tight into place okay. So we've got that all in i'm  going to tuck the wires get the wires started up in the hole the junction box. And then basically got the housing in there i'm going to step up here a bit okay. So just just make sure the little clamps are inside the housing till you get it up in the hole. And then you'll notice there's kind of a bottom foot on each one of these clamps. And as the clamp turns that foot turns as well. And that's going to basically be what hits the bottom side of the tile. And helps put pressure on the  on the tile itself i might just need to get my hand up in here hold that tile down like i said these these ones here can be a little bit tough to maneuver if you can get them kind of started sometimes you can just push them with a screwdriver. And finish them off. So they fold up in there i'm not too sure if you can really even see all this up in here. So give that a push there okay just make sure sure all three of those are engaged it looks like they are okay. So that's that part. Then these are an led  light you might just have a socket up in there for a bulb like i said these are an led with their  transformer. And everything on the back. So this one just simply plugs in to that harness right there push that wire up in there. And then there on the side there's these little friction fit kind of spring pieces of metal there. And again these can be a little tough to get in. But once they're in they usually hold quite well. So usually if you can get one side against the box. And then if i push that direction i can fold these other ones a little bit with my fingers just to get it started up in there. And give that a little push. And i need to hold the tile down while i do it okay. So there that's all that's all that holds that in there it's nice clean finished look close this put these tiles back in here sit down.

And today i want to show you how to  install a sump pit in your basement. So maybe you've got a bit of a high water table or you're having a problem with moisture in your basement. And you've decided that you're going to put a sump p it because you don't have one  basically you know that's what we want to show you today this is the the plastic pre-made pit that we're going to put in. So it's just a big plastic bucket basically with a lid that snaps on. And and. Then there's access here for your pump or your lines to come out. So this pit here is approximately i think it's about 2 ft deep. And it's about 2 ft across actually it might be close to 30 in deep. So obviously before we can install that we need to first of all decide where we want it mark out the concrete cut the concrete jackhammer it out. And dig the hole. So so there's a fair bit of work involved before you can even worry about putting the pit in  in our case today we're actually relocating an existing sp. So i've already done some of the cutting the old sump pit was right here  which was going to end up being in the corner of a bed or of a room in the basement. And they didn't want it there obviously. So we're just moving it over here a little bit to the other side of the wall in this case they've got i'm not even sure if you can see it. But there is a weeping towel coming in under the footing into this sump pit. So we need to connect another extension onto that. And then it'll come through a trench here. And then cut into the side of the the pale into this hole okay. And then the pump. And everything will go in it. So so this video is strictly on you know excavating this hole. And getting that pit set. And in the hole. So so as i said i did do some of the cutting already. So basically what i'm trying to do is cut cut down about 2 in or. So just kind of a perimeter of the of  the area i want to excavate  this will just make a nice clean edge for when we rec concrete in the the surface again. So we cut that chip it out with a jackhammer  we had this smaller one here. And the concrete here is particularly hard. So i think we're going to probably go to a bigger jackhammer just to speed things up a bit. But typically this hammer probably would do what you need it to do your first little chunk that you break out with a jackhammer is always tougher than than once you get that hole out there. And there's room for the pieces to fall into. But we are going to get a bigger one i think to finish the show the video. So you can see i cut the perimeter what i basically did i'm using my  using an old circular saw with a diamond concrete cutting bid in it  we're going to use a a vacuum to help control some of the dust. And a bit of water  obviously you need to be careful we're mixing water with electrical tool. So you don't don't get too crazy dumping it all over the place. And end up shocking yourself,https://youtu.be/BamCDB28oCc?t=0,"['What is the purpose of installing a sump pit in a basement?', 'How do you determine where to install a sump pit?', 'What tools are used for excavating and cutting concrete?', 'Why is it necessary to cut a perimeter around the area to be excavated?', 'What type of jackhammer is recommended for hard concrete?']"

And end up shocking yourself. Now the size of the opening here like i said this pits about 24 in across i allow it about 30 in just to give us a little more room to dig we've got to dig fairly deep. So you want to you want a little extra room to work  if you were cutting this concrete with a grinder you could probably cut a round circle if you wanted to you know whatever whatever you want to do. But in this case i just cut it sort of rectangular sort of squarish. And that should do the trick. So you're going to need  you know eye,https://youtu.be/BamCDB28oCc?t=177,"['What is the approximate size of the opening in the concrete?', 'Why was extra room allowed for digging?', 'What type of tool would be used to cut a round circle in the concrete?', 'How did the person decide on the shape of the cut in the concrete?', 'What is the purpose of allowing some extra space when cutting the concrete?']"

So you're going to need  you know eye protection hearing protection for sure like i said we're going to run a shop vac to try to control some of the dust  you may want a dust mask though as well. So we're just going to continue on just finish off this little piece here that we haven't cut. So far. And it'll just take me one second to get the vacuum. And couple things into place. And then we'll be ready to cut [music]. So you can see. Now when i plunged in with the saw back here to start the cut i already had it started. So it looked like it just dropped in like nothing. But it will take a little bit of work to get your first start to the  cut  you could see i think probably in the video how the vacuum does a good pretty good job of controlling most of the dust you still get some airborne you know you can set a fan up in a window or something too to try to suck some of the the extra out. And then just splashing a bit of water along on here helps also again to settle the dust. And also cools the blade. And and assists in the cutting process a little bit as well. So so we've got our cut all made i'm going to  squeegee some of this excess water just off into the sump pit for. Now and. Then we're going to get the bigger hammer. And start chipping this out okay. So we've  switched out for a little bigger  little bigger  jackhammer here there is a one bigger than this yet that's still electric. But i'm pretty sure this one will do it. Now you can see we've already started here basically i'll just give you a bit of a rundown on how to use one of these in case you never have  generally speaking if you can start near an edge or a corner is usually better. And you know if you're cutting like this you want to start a couple inches away with the tip. So that you don't damage this. And the idea is try to get a a hole broke out. And and cleaned out a little bit. So that. Then when you start hammering back here you know you usually come back a couple inches from the edge. And you know right here i'd be putting the point. And start. And you're trying to break pieces off. And now that this is emptied out the pieces kind of have somewhere to go. And it it works a lot easier from this point once you have a bit of a hole started yeah those are the main things it's obviously going to be loud  you don't for for most jackhammers the weight of the jackhammer really does the work you know leaning all your weight on it sometimes is actually  inhibiting it to work properly you need a little bit of weight on it. And you're going to need to pry on a little bit sometimes. But for the most part just let the the hammer do its work i'm going to have the  wet dry back running. And that'll suck up some of the dust. And also i'll be putting some of the rubble into pales because we've got to paale it out of here. And and get rid of it. So basically i'm just going to work my way through here. And we're probably going to speed up the majority of it because obviously you don't need to see all the see me just sweating my butt off working here. So so you well you'll  see the first little bit here. And then we'll likely speed it up. So get on my safety gear. And go ahead i've just got the gloves on just  cuz pulling out the pieces. And that it's kind of hard on the hands. So this particular jackhammer just has a slide switch some of them have a trigger this one's just a slide. And i should actually i should just speak about the bits too. So the bits here come in. And out by sliding this there's usually a collar on here. And you'll have either a chisel bit or one that'll come to a point usually. And usually the chisel is going to give you the most bang for your buck okay here we go [music] [music]. So you can see that  we've just about got all the concrete broke out. Now this was about probably a little bit over an hour is worth of work to get it broke out we probably got another 20 minutes here by the time we have the the bigger rubble cleaned up. And hauled out we've been just using some  old 5 gallon buckets filling them about half or 3/4 full or whatever you can easily carry you don't want to hurt yourself  we've got to carry it upstairs. And outside. So we're going you know not right full. And you can tell i'm out of breath. So we're just going to get this rubble out of here. And then we can start digging down. And we're going to basically save most of this fill onto a tarp. And reuse it a lot of it around the  around the new pit. And stuff itself  one thing that  it's probably worth mentioning is before you start a project like this there's a few things you should consider about  in the area that you're going to  cut the concrete or start digging one thing is if you have inf floor heat like that's hydronic heating system inside your concrete obviously you cannot do this job you're going to end up cutting a pipe for sure. So don't don't even consider it  another thing to think about is where all your plumbing is coming. And going from in the basement because it will be  below here. And sometimes it can be quite shallow just below the floor. So that's your  any kind of drains from the  say the bathroom  plumbing  your main sewer going out although it should be pretty deep you shouldn't shouldn't have to worry about it. And the main thing would be your main water line coming in. So if you kind of know where your water meter is in the house. And you know basically where it comes in from outside. Then usually it's straight away from there. So make sure you're nowhere near that area cuz that that one  can flood your house pretty quickly before you get the city there to shut it off. So so you think about all those things before you start this kind of project. But if you if you know you're out of the way of any of that stuff. And you're good to go. Then you'll break up your concrete. And start digging okay. So now we've got all the main concrete out of the way we can dig this hole down remember we're we got to dig a big enough hole to sink this barrel into. So it's going to be a fair bit of digging  we're going to need some some of that what we get out of here some of the best stuff which will be the gravels. And stuff that are on top to fill back in around it. So i'm saving that onto this tarp to reuse it. And if we get down to some clay or whatever i'm going to try not to reuse most of that. So it'll get in the buckets. And hauled out again. So pretty basic we're just  just going to be shoveling here for a while to get rid of this stuff here. So we have a hole put that pit in pretty basic straightforward just keep digging actually got a nice amount of gravel in there it's good okay. So i've got all the digging done  you can see this massive crater that i've created here. And you can see there's already some  ground water just seeping back into it  that hole has been dug for about half an hour or. So you can also see that i've got this extension for the weeping tile in in our scenario. And it's just simply slit both both the weeping tile coming into the house. And this extension are just slit. And the two are just slid over each other  preferably this one slid over top of the other one to help keep directing the water this way this trench was created here with just ever. So slight a little bit of little bit lower at this end than it is here. So the water will naturally flow to this to the bucket. So for the most part all the digging i just did with a shovel you can see i have quite a mass of of back fill here some clay. And some gravel  most most part did with the shovel i did bring this  post hole digger here  in the end i didn't need it i had enough room to work. So i didn't worry about that. So we've got that all in i've got my  side of my bucket cut open. And that's just determined by the elevation of the  pipe. So i've got that cut that isn't a tight fit the pipe easily slides through there with room to spare. So so basically it's just a matter of putting your bucket down in the hole redirecting your your pipe into it like that. Now when i was digging the hole i just used a straight edge i wasn't really going for level i'm just using this as a straight edge you know going from floor to floor from concrete to concrete. And getting the bucket i don't want it standing up. So like above the floor if anything i want it down just a bit. And i'm probably oh a quar inch lower than the concrete here. So it's just a matter of getting the bucket sitting in there. So that the straight edge isn't riding up on it sometimes just stepping down in here we'll just settle it down into that hole a little bit okay. So there's no real science to that just get it down below the surface of the floor. And once you've got your pipe all in there just be sure it's laying down nicely you don't have a big hump in the middle or anything  we'll just make sure we put some weight on this when we start our back fill to keep that center down it's sticking into the into the pit itself you know an inch. And a half or whatever. And we're pretty much pretty much ready to just back fill that. So i'm going to put a little bit of clay our our extension of our weeping tiwel doesn't have any grooves in it it's a solid pipe. So we can put clay right on it we don't have to worry that the ground water is going to weep dirt into that. So so we put some clay here we'll try to get some sand in some gravel back in around the the little bit of space that's between the this liner. And and the hole we dug. And you know a little bit of clay a little bit of gravel get it up to grade where we want our concrete. And then we're ready to go okay. So like i said before we're,https://youtu.be/BamCDB28oCc?t=206,"['What type of safety gear is recommended for working with power tools?', 'How does the vacuum help control dust during the cutting process?', 'What are some common things to consider when planning a project that involves digging and concrete removal?', 'Can you use a jackhammer near an edge or corner?', 'What is the purpose of using a weeping tile in a drainage system?']"

And then we're ready to go okay. So like i said before we're going to back fill over the pipe mostly with h clay we're going to use some sand around that little gap around the bucket around the  liner i did take a big pale of clay just a 5 gallon paale. And set it down in that liner just to hold it in place. So it isn't moving around while we're doing any back filling. So we'll just get some of this in here that's right i wanted to stand on there too once you have some weight on there it basically holds that [music] down okay i just want to get some gravel around there around that pit [music] okay. So that just kind of gets our pit sitting stable. So it's not  shifting around in that hole on us. And we'll use a little bit of this clay to take up some of the [music] bulk. So once i've got the clay kind of roughly in there i just want to pack it down get it settled down clay isn't the best back fill material. But here we're not structurally really holding anything. So i'm just using this wood to basically just pack that down in there okay. So we finished our back filling we got got the  gravel in there we tamped it down with the board. And then i walked around in there just to pack it down that much more  swept the the area around us here just to get rid of any stones that are up on the concrete  more than anything just keep from kneeling on them that sort of thing  i also ran the broom around just on the inside edge here you know there's some little lips. And stuff cuz this isn't going to be perfect. And just swept off any sand or gravel that was up on there too. So we get a little bit of bond there  i'm just mixing the bagged kind of premixed concrete for this little job. And i probably only mix about a third of a bag at a time cuz i'm just mixing it by hand in this pale. But basically just going to mix it dump it in there we'll prod it in nice with the trel. And you know. Then work our way around. But we'll we'll get ourself worked a fair ways from that side there before we start tring or doing too much messing around. So just mix it as your  as the instructions tell you to for the [music] [applause] manufacturer it's not the easiest to mix it just in a pale. But for this little bit that we're doing i'm just using a little paddle to try to make sure i'm mixing right down to the [applause] bottom it's not quick real quick setting or anything it sets relatively quick. But it's not like i've got to be in a huge panic here [applause] just trying to get mix straight down to the bottom i probably put a little more than i should have in here to start [applause] with okay this bouch is a little runny cuz i added a little more water to it than i really wanted to. But i don't know if i mentioned  we're basically trying to leave about three inches of concrete around there  we didn't do any  rebar dowels or anything. But you could dowel in rebar if you wanted to  a lot of this floor is in this section here is barely 2 in. So if i try to re dowel anything in there it's probably just going to break off anyway. So so we're just pouring it around there it'll kind of run where it needs to run. And like i said we'll  do some tring here after a bit [applause] on. So already setting up a little bit over here i'm just kind of basically vibrating it down into there it's kind of hard to deal with a little little area like this just go around. And basically slope it to whatever your kits at okay. So you're just kind of in my case like i said before my pit's about a/4 inch low. So it just creates a little bit of a gradual slope back to it i'm just kind of oh my weeping tile's already  letting some water in there. So [music] just kind of working it a little bit kind of gets the air out of it that might be trapped in there i'm just using a magnesium float for this part probably was a little bit runnier than it really needed to [music] be okay i need a little bit more to finish off there oops okay. So a little bit more just to finish this area off here you can see my  pit is just a little bit offset that way from the center of the hole. So got a little bit more width over here on the concrete you'll get once this dries you'll actually get a little bit of shrinkage. And you'll probably get a bit of a crack around the perimeter from the old pad if it's in a if it's in a floor where you want to  you know maybe you're putting some vinyl or something like that once this cures. Then you might want to go over it with some self-leveling cement just to kind of smooth it out anywhere where it shrunk. So with the mag we're not trying to get it perfect. But trying to get it pretty close. And we'll use a steel trel on it once it sets up a little bit more needs a little bit of time yet. So i'll just keep filling in this trench  with the concrete. And then we'll come back to this okay. So once the  concrete has set up a little bit further  we're going to use a steel trel on it we used the magnesium float before. And that's basically just to get it pretty much into place it helps pull up some of the fines to the top. And then the steel trel once  once your bleed waters have kind of come off the concrete you know the the moisture that bleeds through. Then you can should be ready to trel it. And this will just give it a little smoother finish close in any  this is actually still a little bit wet. So we're just kind of flattening it out with this. And you can see how it makes a smoother finish than what we've got over there that we did with the magnesium trail a little hard on a small area like this when we've poured it in different batches one's drier one's wetter than the other. So it's all setting up just a little bit differently. But i'm just going to go around this main pit area i know down there it's not going to be ready for the steel  because it was  poured later. But i'll just go around here [applause] a little bit tricky in such a small little area here. But and  also before i did this i went around around the edges. And just kind of cleaned up any of this little bit of paste that's around the edge sometimes there's a rock in there. So i just clean it up with the edge of this before i get to there okay that's about as far as i can go over there we just kind of work that edge in as good as we can it's not the easiest thing to do when you're coming up against a cut. So that's pretty much  really is the wrap for that this video  we will be doing a  separate video on actually installing the sump,https://youtu.be/BamCDB28oCc?t=879,"['What type of material was used for backfilling over the pipe?', 'Why did the creator use clay to hold the liner in place?', 'How did the creator mix and pour the premixed concrete?', 'What is the purpose of using a magnesium float in the concrete mixing process?', 'What is the final step in finishing the concrete floor?']"

And in our video today i want to show you how to install this  submersible sump pump in our  in our new sump pit that we just installed in a previous video. So if you haven't seen the installation of the pit you might want to check that video out i'm just taking the lid off to get it out of the way  basically what we've got is a is a dual pump system. So the main pump that you see here is a 120 volt submersible pump  i forget what it is 10 gall an hour or minute i'm not even sure  they vary a little bit. So it doesn't really matter on the size. So that's the the 120 volt. And then right here we've got a 12vt backup. So if the power goes down this one automatically just takes over. And kicks in. And runs off a 12vt battery. So there's different combinations this happens to be all one unit  purchased exactly like you see it everything see right here is what was in the box. So it's it's fairly user friendly. And pretty quick to set up. So and actually it was fairly inexpensive as well. So the main main components of this we've already talked about the pumps. But over on this side we've got all the electrical requirements for the 120 volt. So it just simply plugs right into the wall this here is basically a switch attached to the to the  float right here for the main pump. So once the float indicates it needs to turn the pump on the switch activates power. And it turns the the 120 volt pump on on this side  all this wiring here is to do with the 12vt. So we've got a couple leads here that are going to hook to the battery really simple  this is just kind of the information center. And the charging system it because this particular one does trickle charge your battery as well  this wire is just the electrical hookup from the pump to this system. So really simple both pumps each have their own built-in check valve. So here's a check valve here check valve over here. And what that does is when the pump turns on. And pumps water out that check valve is a one-way valve. So when the pump turns off. And the water wants that's in this vertical piece of pipe wants to come back down it can't it's stopped at the check valve. So okay. So i think i showed the floats they're both here this is the for the 120 vol vol. And this little guy over here is for the 12vt system. So everything's right here it's all in one package nice. And neat a lot of wires. But we can deal with all that once we have it out of the way  we're doing a bit of a temporary setup here because there's going to be some changes  down the road. But we're going to set it completely up. So you can see you know how it's going to work  basically in the hole  our pits about 2 ft deep there's already water in it  we've got some blocks sitting in the bottom just to set the pump on. So that it's up off the bottom a little bit. And it isn't sucking in any sand or gravel that might be down in there. So i can simply lower this pump in there get it sitting on my blocks get it sitting about where i think i want it i'm just going to get my electrical stuff out of the way. So we've got it sitting down there in the hole our lid has a has a slotted hole in it for all the plumbing. And and wiring to come up out of. So that it has  easy access. And then once the lids on you know it's it's fairly safe kids aren't going to fall in it or whatever or pets okay. So again pretty simple setup i've already prepped up the plumbing. So basically it just is going to fit into there. And over into there. And then we'll adjust the pump. So everything reaches nicely  this is just a rubber connection. So it it kind of helps to  make a quick disconnect if you need to. But it also probably works a little bit good as an isolation  setup. So that any vibration from the pump isn't transferring through all the  plumbing as well. So so i can see that this  needs to slide over there just a little bit more. And then we should be fine i'll maybe glue that fitting first. And then i'll tighten these rubber clamps over here or these  steel clamps on the rubber fitting there. So actually before i do that i should just talk a little bit about the  couple different ways that you could drain it our system we're allowed here to pump this this  pit right into the city sewer system some municipalities won't allow that. So you're pipe may have to come up. And out. And actually out the wall of the house. And drain to the exterior of the home if you got that type of setup ideally you want a fair bit of pipe on the outside. So the water is running away from the house quite a ways. And not just going right back down to the outside of your basement into the weeping tile. And back to the pit you're just recirculating. So you want to get it out. And the way  like i said here we're we're going right into the into the public  sewer system. Now that's a bit wet i should dry that out actually  d it i don't have a rag on me i've got some paper towel over here i'll just grab quick we had an old pump set up here temporarily overnight. And just got a bit of residual water in that line. So just dried that out put some glue all the the way around here stick the two together okay. Now there there is some strapping. And stuff here on the wall to help support this pipe. So that the weight isn't just sitting solely on the pump or you know put a block of wood under there or something to hold it up. So i can tighten up these clamps for our connections okay just like that this glue out of the way. So we don't have our  our permanent electrical supply right close in handy here like i said there's a bit of another renovation going on here as well. So i'm just going to temporarily run this off of a  extension cord. So so this end i'm just going to simply plug into the cord which actually i've got here there is a a little  transformer here this needs to be plugged into 110 as well. And then plugs into that yellow box that runs the 12vt. And this is the charging sorry the the charging apparatus for that  right. Now today i don't have that quite ready to go yet. But we will run another power bar over here just to plug that in. So once you get the the pump in the hole your plumbing hooked together they they send you a fair bit of cable here. And some zip ties as well some plastic ties. So we can kind of get all the electrical around the pipe here.

And fasten to the pipe to hold it up out of the hole i'm just going to do that here. Now so got to get all our cables make sure nothing's twisted up or tink or anything like that. So just kind of bring everything up here neatly we'll put one cable tie down here just to hold things up i won't get too carried away with this. But i just wanted to strap a couple pieces up out of the way okay. So we've got that hooked up there we can actually  i won't hook up the 120 just right away. But what i will do is hook up the battery system this this this here comes also with some pieces on the back. So you could zip tie it you know attach to this pipe or whatever. But there's not a lot of cable on this between the yellow box. And the battery connection. So you need to make sure you're at least close enough to to get the  connection of the battery. So we've got in this case we've got a deep cycle battery it's fully charged make sure it's fully charged before you set this all up. So that your trickle charger has a decent decent chance to  get started with it. Now that audible you probably heard that that's the  sound you'll hear if the battery goes low enough this gives off a warning to let you know that it's it's actually  depleted its charge or it's no good or whatever the cas maybe there's a few  indicators here with lights kind of gives you a visual you know every day as you walk by or whatever just make sure that everything's working properly you can actually turn the alarm,https://youtu.be/ABsk_4zrlbM?t=472,"['What type of electrical system is being used in this setup?', 'How do you secure cables to the pipe?', 'Why is it important to ensure the battery connection is close enough?', 'What type of battery is being used in this setup?', 'What warning sounds or indicators are provided for low battery levels?']"

So actually that's on there's a test button there okay. So we've got that. Now this particular system they do have a battery backup system that you can buy or sorry the battery setup that you can buy specifically made for them. And they've got a probe that would normally go in in one of the battery cells. And it sets off an alarm if the battery  fluid gets too low. So that you know you need to maintain your battery. Now when you're using anything. But their recommended battery you're told to  cut this lead off. And actually connect it to the positive cable as well otherwise the alarm will be going off all the time. So we've got that this cable is the main connection down to the pump from that system. So now before we have the 110 volt plugged in  by rights i should be able to manually hit the float right. Now and ,https://youtu.be/ABsk_4zrlbM?t=610,"['What type of battery backup system does the alarm use?', 'How does the probe work with the battery cells?', 'Why is it recommended to cut off the lead and connect it to the positive cable?', 'Can you manually turn off the alarm?', 'What happens when the battery fluid gets too low?']"

Now and  activate the 12vt pump. Now it's not going to pump water because it's actually not in the water. But i'll just check it here manually i think you can probably hear that [music] running. Now i can't get it to shut off cuz it's not getting a prime okay. So when that you know i'm just testing to make sure that pump. And everything's working i just left that unplugged here for right. Now right back here is the charging port for that other cable. But yours your system could be a little different. But okay. So we've checked that that float that seems to be okay it's kicking the pump in. Now i can plug in the 120. And again like i said i'm just using this cord for right. Now now this one  the floats in a bit of a cage. So i'm going to see if i can actually get a hold of it to manually check it there that kicked it on you can hear that there was barely enough water in there to to run it. But and there it shut off already. But if we had more water in there it would actually run for however long it needed to let the float down. And it be  shutting off on its own  the one thing i noticed on this one there's no real way to set your like your level of the  when when the float activates the pumps cuz they're kind of fixed right to the  right to the pump setup itself. So really the only way you can adjust that is by,https://youtu.be/ABsk_4zrlbM?t=680,"['What type of music was playing in the background?', 'How does the pump get primed?', 'Can the level of water be adjusted on the float-activated pumps?', 'Why did the pump shut off after being activated?', 'What happens when more water is added to the system?']"
779.0,985.0,Basements,PLh0KqGKtX4oWUr5nKO6U9y-otNi6OA0ud,How To Install A Sump Pump,ABsk_4zrlbM,How To Install A Sump Pump: putting less or more blocks or thickness underneath the pump,98b4245b-19e4-23b4-023d-f402708e46ee,Right to the pump setup itself. So really the only way you can adjust that is by putting less or more blocks or thickness underneath the pump  it doesn't really matter really how much water is below your pump it's you're you're more concerned about the fact that it can't fill up high enough to overflow your actual pit. And in our case here our float  the water level would wouldn't even come up probably 15 in from the top here before the float comes on. So so it's going to keep it well down there buys a little bit of time you know if the if the pump is having a little trouble keeping up it buys a little bit of time there too. So so in our setup here all this basically goes together there's a lid that fits over here that goes on all this like i said fits down in the hole keeps kids. And pets. And that sort of thing from falling down there. And you know kind of keeps it all nicely contained. So again  typically you want to have your  electrical requirements right here for this type of setup you'd need at least two two places to plug stuff into this being such a large box  i guess they've got it set up that it would work the other plug would still fit if this is in the bottom. So about the only other thing to speak a little bit about is anytime you have a battery you don't want to set it directly on concrete  you want it on a block of wood or in this case we've got it in this plastic  case here which actually has a lid. And everything. So if there's any spillage battery overheats bubbles oil over anything it's all contained in there too safely. So this is probably the best setup for you is right there  i think that's that's about all i can really tell you about this. So pretty basic setup especially when it all comes as one unit like that really everything was there except for buying the battery outside of outside of that everything was in the box that  this pump was in. So so i don't think there's anything else i can tell you like i said before we we installed this sump pit. So if you need to do that you might want to check that video out as well this pump is small enough it'll fit in i think up to even like a 5 gallon pale if that's all the type of size you've got for diameter for your existing pum  sum pit this one actually will fit inside of that. So which was really common for years. And years a lot of people just sunk a metal or a plastic pale in the ground. And that's what they used. So okay. So i think that's it. So i hope hope this  helps your process in installing or doing the similar type thing. And good luck with that. And we've hopefully given you enough tips to even maybe help you  decide what kind of p pump that you want  we've got all kinds of other information  you can check us out on  youtube obviously you're there watching this you can check out our website we've got a forum there which is the best place to post any questions you have about this or any other project you're doing  we've got twitter we've got facebook there's all kinds of ways to keep connected with us  we've also  got a patreon account set up.

Now that the water's off you gotta empty the sucker all right empty out the back. Now this is called the tank. And this is a one-piece toilet. So we don't have any risk of leakage here. But if it's a two piece especially make sure that you've emptied out the back. And you just check to make sure that the two screws. And bolts that are there are tight. And nothing's wiggling around okay managing your water here is really the key if you don't manage the water that's in the toilet when you move it because it is a p-trap if you look at an old toilet you'll see the pipe come down. And up okay there's a big snake here. And the water actually sits in the bowl all the way down. And all the way back up again until it spills over the top to go down to the through the floor. And so that's the p-trap here just like underneath the sink if you leave all that water in there as you move it splashes over the top wall okay. And it ends up all over your floor. So what i got a system here to help you do this. So you're not going to run into trouble first of all get a pail of water because it's a p-trap if i pour a large volume of water down at a quick time it creates a vacuum. And it'll suck all the water out of that p-trap almost to the very end check this out. So the water level used to be here. Now it's down here. So that means on the back side of that p-trap that's in here i've got a few inches to play with that's enough for me to manage no need to go grab a vacuum. And shove your vacuum in a toilet.

And pay attention to which one you have if you have a traditional toilet it's just going to be the white caps with toilet bolts you might even need a hacksaw to cut those bolts off depending on the condition of the toilet this toilet looks to be grouted. And silicone to the floor if you've never seen that before consider it because the grout offers you a lot of stability. And the silicone gives you a great seal look at that there we go what do you mean it was crowded to the floor what does that mean well the toilet was installed.

Now she's ready to be released okay. So what we're going to do is we're going to lift this up matthew's going to bag it behind me. And take it out of the way i like putting something like this straight into a shower pan unfortunately today because we're using lights we can't get to the shower pan. So we'll set it behind us the reason for the bag is in case there's any water pouring dripping out we keep it contained okay. Now we're also going to get a chance to see the condition of the seal on this toilet. And we'll talk about that. And we'll discuss options to make this work we haven't done this in a little while yeah this one's a difficult one because you're basically here you're getting it up in the air i have nothing to grab here yeah. So i'm going to grab the back corner. And the front edge okay right here. And i'm just going to wrap it okay ready all right i'm trying to lift it up level [applause] there you go okay is this right down yeah all right. Now at this point if you can just get more bag towards the back okay. And then rock it forward all right for a little bit there we go okay that's good. Now slide that right over easy easy yeah okay well that one worked really well i like that system. So this particular toilet came with a whole flange nut. And bolt system look at that who installed that look at that not even a drip of water no wax there's a lot of options out here for doing this kind of work. So what i'm going to do. Now is let's take this apart. And we'll show you different options. So this is actually a pretty advanced toilet it's going to be rather expensive to buy these about four or five hundred bucks here's the deal traditional toilets don't come with a system like this okay for connection that's where the screws went into isn't that amazing let's get something back to what it looks like a little bit more traditional okay. So this particular toilet comes with installation instructions for this unit right here. And this one sits on the wax all right. And it's just a really traditional wax ring. But the toilet itself is designed differently okay. So here we go this is all special installation for that particular unit this is traditionally what you're going to find,https://youtu.be/eIkPTezSkx4?t=250,"['What type of silicone was used in the repair?', 'Why did the installer use a shower pan?', 'How does the seal on the toilet work?', 'What are some options for making the toilet work?', 'What is unique about the installation system of this particular toilet?']"

So here's the wax ring that you would buy that i used in this situation all right. And it is one inch thick okay. And it gets compressed. And it makes a really good sew. And you can see it is no longer one inch thick all right. Now the reason that it fits. So well. And it didn't leak anywhere is because the height of this flange versus the toilet the tile here i'm a big believer in the idea of this the top of your flange needs to be at bare minimum flush with your finish floor or a quarter of an inch higher. And anywhere in that range okay. Now on this particular floor it has a slight slope look at this almost flush at the back okay full quarter of an inch higher than the floor on the front all right. And that's why this works because i use a regular wax if this is lower i wouldn't want to about this [applause] okay this is the large version of the wax same product one. And a half times as thick okay. So if you have a toilet that's really flush with the floor i wouldn't suggest going with the regular wax get the jumbo reinforced flange cap wax okay get the jumbo. And that'll help make sure that you get good compression into the wax. Now let me just go through a couple of things here when you pull this one out of the package okay the jumbo wax there is a possibility that you can screw this up if you have a good gap here if you have a nice gap here. And you get the jumbo wax you have the potential of doing something like this you're going to go like this you're going to drop your wax in place right you're going to line up your bolts you're going to go to set the toilet in if when you go to set the toilet in you're not all the way where you want to be. So you're going straight down on it okay you're not going to get good compression what possibly could happen is you could start here. And then you might start moving backwards okay. And you get into position you think oh great i got a good seal what you've done is you've collapsed your hole okay. And you end up just going to do the demonstration here i've seen this before many times we'll get a call from a customer they're like this is back in the days when i work warranty for a renovation company. And i'd open up the toilet. And i'd see something like this all right instead of a nice big three inch hole they got this all right that looks like the size of a drain for the sink you're going to run into trouble. So you don't want to be forcing the wax back or sliding it left. And right when you drop your toilet on you want to be over top foot go straight down if that means you need two or three people to help you. Then get them okay. But you've got to make sure you go straight down onto your wax to avoid that trouble all right garbage okay here we go. So i'm going to set this aside because i'm going to use this one later to reinstall this toilet let me just go through a couple of other options,https://youtu.be/eIkPTezSkx4?t=402,"['What type of material is traditionally used for the wax ring in toilets?', 'How does the compression of the wax ring work?', 'Why is it recommended that the top of the flange be at least a quarter inch higher than the finish floor?', ""What happens if you don't get good compression into the wax when installing a toilet?"", 'What are some common mistakes to avoid when using jumbo reinforced flange cap wax?']"

And i use this on a toilet. And my  a bathroom video max in my my form here's downstairs yeah. And downstairs we had  oh this this place the floor downstairs is over crawl space. And the crawl space is really short. And it's old-school 1880 construction. So the floor has a lot of movement. And so what we did down there to solve our toilet problem is i had a the toilet flange sitting on the plywood. And then we had flooring. And because of the height of the flooring i had to add some beef to it we put in this rubber gasket here okay it goes over the holes. And this rubber gasket replaces the need for wax okay. So then what happens is the toilet sits on this. And as the house moves. And breathes. So does the gasket see that. So if the toilet is moving around in position all year round with different seasons the gasket maintains contact with the toilet. And have a good seal wax doesn't do that once wax is pushed. And collapsed it does not spring back in place. So if you have an older house or you're on a crawl space. And you get weird weather having a foam gasket like this might be a good solution for you this was available at home depot if you want to search it out we'll put the  i'll put a link i think it might be available on amazon closet flange extension okay. And it also comes with a flange extender. Now this ring is going to be for a good first this situation here check this out we are adding new flooring. Now look what happens all of a sudden the flange is lower than my finish floor okay you don't want that because if i put this on here with that lower than that my toilet is not even going to make contact with that flange okay that's the serious problem make sure you've always got that at least flush or a quarter inch higher. So what they do is they sell this little extension kit okay boom boom boom there we go. Now we set this up. So your bolts are when you're looking at it like a clock face you're at three o'clock. And nine o'clock nice. And square. And level don't go like this or the toilet might have a potential to pop right out of the holes okay. Now you're high enough that might even be a little bit too high okay. But what you want to do is you want to screw these four corners right into the existing abs drain system okay. So i have abs drain you might be on a cpvc if it's on cast you can't use this you can't use this extender on cast okay they have a different one. And that's a whole new world most people in the world were not on cast plumbing anymore because extended toilet bolt kits as well because when you start building up your toilet kit you might not have bolts long enough to get above the new toilet when you start stacking all this together right. So all three of these things work together to get an extension. And a seal let me get these out of the damn way okay there we go extension seal. And in between this is a gasket under compression. And it seals everything okay that's why we're screwing it down a great compression,https://youtu.be/eIkPTezSkx4?t=590,"[""['What type of construction does the author's bathroom have?', 'Why did the author use a foam gasket on their toilet?', 'How does the foam gasket solve the problem of a moving toilet?', 'What is the minimum height required for a toilet flange to ensure proper contact?', 'What type of plumbing system can the extension kit be used with?']""]"

So many plumbers use silicone. And throw on a teflon ring it's lazy it's wrong it always leaks anywhere where you have water sitting silicone will give out. And eventually because the toilet should sit there for the lifetime of the of the room we don't reinstall them every year to get a fresh seal. But if you have any silicone in that assembly water will get underneath between that silicone it'll start working its way out under your subfloor brought out your subfloor. And when your subfloor starts to rot around your toilet all your screws are in rotting wood. And so the wood swells. And then everything starts to get loose. And then your toilet starts to wiggle. And as your toilet wiggles the wax starts to open up worse. And worse. And worse next thing you know the wax is broken the water's all around the toilet this is what happens it can take five or ten years. But so don't let somebody install a toilet incorrectly in your house because the warranty they're gonna give you on that installation is 30 days to a year tops right. But the damage they can cause by doing it wrong will bite you in the butt years down the road you'll be sitting there going geez honey there's a really weird dark stain on the ceiling what's up with that somebody use silicone on your toilet,https://youtu.be/eIkPTezSkx4?t=792,"[""['What type of material should not be used for sealing toilets?', \n ['Why is Teflon considered lazy and wrong in toilet assembly?', \n ['How does silicone affect the subfloor over time?', \n ['What are the consequences of a poorly installed toilet?', \n ['How long can it take for damage from a poor installation to manifest?']""]"

Now the next option is this product here okay it's very similar. Now this one comes this one has two different thicknesses. And rings okay. So this is my go-to any time that i know i need an extension. But i'm not sure how big it's going to be because i haven't pulled the toilet off yet i buy one of these okay there's two gaskets that come with it there's an adhesive backing on it okay the adhesive backing is to apply to the underside of the ring i'm gonna set that up bam all right. Now you're ready to go extension all right. Now the reason i like this particular system it's like i said it's got the screws. So i can screw in four corners the other thing it has is this bolt system doesn't allow it to slide out okay. So you can put these in the right location. And then you stack it like this. And then you would screw it in okay. Now when you're gonna go install your toilet they have these clips check this out little plastic washers it's kind of like a zip tie okay. And you can get your bolts standing straight up by using that zip tie remember what i said about setting your toilet straight down if you use this system here you can line this up perfectly. And as an individual you can set that on if you don't have those these bolts can be all over the place making contact with the toilet. And then you gotta lean. And slide. And try to you need two people. But with this it's a one person installation very common out there is the existing floor if you're adding tile. Then you know you have to get one. And a quarter inch thick on your subfloor. So what we do is we don't move the flange we add the plywood around it we got a great video that we added the subfloor okay if you're doing a project like that you need to add subfloor thickness we'll put a video link in the description we can check the card if you get cards in your notification the other thing is when you go that thick on your tile take the the seal okay boom double stack this bad boy okay good to go. Now when you do your screws you screw through here they're already lined up boom boom boom all the way down into the abs. Now you've got enough height difference here to add plywood. And tile. And still have a little bit sitting above your floor okay guaranteed every time if you're doing a tile job. And you're going from just regular subfloor because you had a vinyl sheet floor go back to the original 5 8 get that little quarter inch plywood out of there grab one of these kits. And double stack it all right. And then you can install your toilet knowing that you're going to have a great seal. And depending on the thickness like i said you can go with the regular wax if you are a little bit above your floor when you're finished or you can go the large wax when you're done all right,https://youtu.be/eIkPTezSkx4?t=864,"['What type of material is used in this toilet extension system?', 'How does the bolt system prevent the toilet from sliding out?', 'What is the purpose of the adhesive backing on the ring?', 'Why is it recommended to use a quarter inch thick subfloor for tile installation?', 'What happens when you double stack the plywood and tile with this toilet extension system?']"

And you can actually just take a torch to it really lightly. And then you can hammer it flat okay i know it's crazy. And then you can put your adhesive right over top of that. And then bolt your toilet to the floor there's a few other varying situations. But they also make a a flange insert that goes into that pipe. And it's called twist. And seal all right it's a white pvc has a big three inch black gasket on it. And the sides are tapered the idea is you set it in place you start spinning it. And the the contact that the the gasket has with the side of the pipe slowly starts to get compressed tighter. And tighter. And tighter as you thread it down. So if you have an old pipe. And you don't have a flange. And you've got nothing attached to that twist. And seal will save your bacon okay. So it is on the market all of these things are available at your local building store you don't have to go to a specialty supply store for this that's the best part when in doubt if you have an issue take a picture of what you're dealing with get a measurement of whatever your finish is from your floor know your flooring assembly you're going to be using you can go to the hardware store.

And you can make a ton of money doing it. So now that we got our flooring installed let's take a look at the actual implementation of the solution here we'll start off by going with the thick ring. Now you're going to see that maybe that's allowable on the back because i have a slope floor. And a level fixture  i'm way too thick at the front. So that's not gonna be acceptable remember this it's gonna be sitting on the floor. So i can't have something that's causing this to be sitting too high off the ground or that's just going to be a serious problem for me here we go this is the thinner piece okay i'm just above flush here maybe an eighth. And i'm a quarter in front i like that we're gonna go with it you know it's funny because you know most toilets don't have an elaborate system like this. And this has an integrated rubber gasket here that the toilet actually is going to stretch. And have its own self-seal. And i'm using wax to seal this to my my flange majority of toilet toilets that are on the market today are basically they're cheap they don't have you know expensive flange options there's a lot of different companies out there who sell four six eight hundred dollar toilets. And they have really complex systems to manage the fact that it'll never leak. But the average person is getting a builder grade toilet or they're going to a box store to find a toilet to replace what they have. Now and they just don't sell quality there. So you have to contend with the fact that your installation has to be bloody perfect to protect yourself there's just no mercy for you [laughter] wow that'd be nice if they weren't quite. So aggressive if when you put your flange on. And you're over gaps or screws. And you can't use the pre-drilled holes don't worry about it all right just reposition i know this ain't sexy. But it's going to get done [music] okay yeah just because it works doesn't mean it's easy all right. Now this is just nasty we're dealing with these wax rings if you want you can wear latex gloves if you can get a even find them due to covet it's hard to get a hold of products like that at the hardware store nowadays. So where are some clothes that you can rub your hands on. And get rid of the wax all right. Now that's in position next couple of steps got to happen pretty darn quick here all right we do not want to be smelling our sewer system thank you timmy's for your help it's just wax. But you don't want to have too much buildup on the inside. And make your hole smaller right all right. Now here we go it's amazing. Now with most conventional toilets all you do is you put the wax down attach your screws. And drop your toilet right over top with this system i have to go grab a wrench. Now but i got to install this coupling i got to install this system over top. And then tighten my screws [music]. So you can see that the nut sits on top of these brass washers when the washers start to bend you're putting more pressure on that toilet than you need to okay that's your key you don't know when to stop you want to know how much pressure as soon as this nut starts to bend that washer. And so it's folding into the hole just stop you've got enough pressure you're not gonna doing any more favor to yourself by going any tighter all right well. Now i'm just gonna drop the toilet in place. And connect the water supply again cutting the bolts down because i don't want to have any interruption with setting that new one on top boom this particular toilet what's that for that's where this goes okay that's where the screw the screw to set this in goes. So when you're going to go set the toilet down put the hole right in the middle of that tape. And then set it down i'll bend to the left you go to the right i know it seems silly. But straight over okay i'm good me too there you go it just sits right in place [music] put our little decorative cap on there that looks pretty connect our water supply shut off valves always start with finger tight. And when it gets stiff you know you've made contact with the gasket that's in there okay. Then you can take a pliers give it another full turn maybe a 14. And a half really gets good compression okay check for leaks we're good. Now remember whenever you're doing a remodeling project you're adding new flooring if your plumbing is coming through the floor you don't have to cut it off. And put on a new shutoff valve just work your flooring around that hole get yourself one of these this is called a split pipe flange okay this will cover up the pipe. And just snaps in place. And you just set it there good to go perfect every time here we go guys. Now listen very careful when you put the you don't want to at the last moment when you have a full tank of water crack the darn tank remember we are remodeling this bathroom it's a four piece. So we've got a shower tub new vanity double sink instead of one all these projects are in our new video series you can click the link over here.

And cut the angles for all my little pieces of wood. But it advertises a cuts pipe tubes we're about to find out i just got an old pail here there's gonna be some water. And water pressure. So we're gonna just give this a cut there we go you don't have the right tool for the job have a good tool for the job of these that's a lot safer than using a knife there we go i'm gonna cut this back a little bit where i don't see any compound or anything on the pipe.

So you keep i'm getting a kink in the line of our feed to the toilet that becomes kind of a cute little system we just installed the shutoff valve. And a brand new construction text line. And about six or seven seconds. And you can't do that with copper you'd have to solder that. And drain the line. And dry it out. And if you're a homeowner. And you're running away in your own house this is the way to go. So from the backside you just put on a little clamp nail that into place hold on this nice. And tight we're gonna be good to go yeah for moving under the toilet the plumbing rough-in has a three-inch piece of pipe here for the toilet. So i went out. And i bought myself this handy little abs saw i got this a couple of weeks ago because i had to make an adjustment in a ceiling for a vent stack it was just kind of nutty today i could only reach in there with the long saw like this to get to it. So i thought this is great this tool was only like nine dollars. So if you're doing a little bit of plumbing at home. And you're looking for a good way to cut bite this is a really small fine-tooth saw it cuts the abs instead of melting it a lot of tools out there will melt it. And it just makes a hell of a mess. But basically what you do you bend the sob lead candle holder to the ground. And we're just cutting flush [music] [music] all right take my knife clean the burgers okay no this is my flint it's a three inch inside pipe flange for just such an occasion hey can you grab me a coffee cup please all right what we're gonna do.

229.0,611.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,How To Install A Toilet,OI-jv1EXPFU,How To Install A Toilet: glue the inside of the pipe,a1d95ed4-6c6b-2c8c-94c0-e19ecdcfdca1,Coffee cup please all right what we're gonna do. So we're gonna glue the inside of the pipe. And then we're gonna glue the flange okay taking very careful note where these rectangle holes are not to have them at three. And nine o'clock that's where the bolts start. And then you want to move them. So that's that nice. And tight. And then when your bowl goes in it'll slide in a position it'll be locked there when you type your toilet these little rectangular layers here to allow the bolton access. So make sure you position your flanges thank you. And of course until we're ready to go all the way get through the sewer gases. So when you're doing your toilet itself want to make sure that you've got all your bolts. And nuts. And your decorative caps because this is something you want to install before you put the brass nut on okay very important if you try doing that first installing the toilet adding these later you'll be sadly disappointed with the performance this actually snaps on. And this designed to sit snug to the toilet. So you have to install this piece before your brass nut okay we go to install. And put our wax ring there okay take the nuts off go don't let it go down the hole in the toilet lower down these little things here agree they just attach this thread. And they're designed. So that once you put it in position you can pull up on the nut like that. And it'll hold it standing up tell me when you're putting on your toilet that's really takes a lot of the guesswork happens the way you do this is actually from the front hold the ball like that straddle this wall situation i can. Now carry the weight on my elbows they can hover over the toilet. And visually make sure that i'm getting that bolt. And each one of those holes. And then just follow that down. And now i want to put the same kind of pressure on the whole toilet surface the entire time i'm pressing down. And sometimes the best way to do that let's just have a seat ah perfect important to note you want to put your medal your little metal washer. And then you put this. Now i don't know if the camera will pick this up. But on the top of this they actually print the sign this side up you'll see it this way just like the roof of a house you want that there because that's actually what the toilet bowl covers going to go over top of. And that's how it snaps on. And then you put on the nut nate run upstairs. And get the grinder with the little cutoff wheel out of the truck place. So every time you buy a toilet bowl it's too long they make it long on purpose generally speaking they make them. So no matter how many layers of flooring somebody's headed to their house they can attach a toilet. So don't ask me why. But they go a little bit overboard here it's two. And a half inch toilet bowl if you end up needing a toilet extension in the kit they have three inch bolts. So it'd be nice if just one somebody would make a toilet bowl it was the right bloody size. And so on the toilet at normal situation. So i'll show you how to use the hacksaw to do this first because i don't expect everybody to have a grinder with a metal cut-off wheel. But basically this is a similar to drywall you want less pressure. But lots of movement okay i mean you are only cutting brass here after. So nice. And controlled because you don't want to break the toilet. Now if it's a little bit too loose just tighten up the bolt again snap that bad boy on blow up your desk you cuz they go. So the alternate method is pull out your grinder with your cutoff wheel this works great too. And it works in a jiffy [music] oh yeah. So now we got our tank thank you nate this is a little gasket okay big wish what's on the end roll that sucker on make sure its contacting the toilet the entire area around its pushed on as far as it goes. And then all we got to do with this particular model i should mention sometimes you're trying to companies out there that make these bowls that you'll slide in. And you have to attach to the tank first. And then put it on the toilet. So double-check your directions i always double-check their directions sometimes people do these little weird things that you weren't don't see coming set it in place we're dropping these in their holes the idea that this rubber gasket under compression creates that watertight seal okay. So here's my secret for putting on the tank bolts hold the nut in your hand. And set the washer on top of it like that reach down i'll hold the bolt study. And set it in place go backwards until you feel it grab the thread go forward okay i don't know what is it with toilets. But every bolt seems to be. So bloody long okay that's where there's one company in the world somewhere in thailand that means nothing. But thread of bolts. And they do it for the whole bloody world. And so there's all these different sizes they make one universal toilet bowl gavin making the toilet bowls over there probably a billionaire you want to tighten that until your tank is nice.

And we just thread that on to our three-eighths just be careful when you buy your shutoff valve that it says half inch. And three-eighths you can get a half inch quarter remember that three-eighths is the typical water supply for toilets. And faucets where quarter-inch is the water supply for a fridge line you don't want to get the wrong one because this will make a 15 minute job take a whole hour because you've got to do a return trip to the store there you go once it's snug take the wrench to put a couple of turns into it bring your water supply up okay you know if you were looking from the backside at that it's actually turning to the right okay. So it's it's actually turning clockwise if you. And imagine yourself staring at it from the floor it's important always look at it from the position of staring at the bolt. And then you'll know which way to go there's the advantage of this shutoff valve it gets to be installed reverence comfortable like i said. Now that that's done i'm going to go. And clamp that to the wall nate goes. And turns the house water back on we're going into pop these little caps from the backside because this bathroom is being used kind of as a in the event of company. And it's downstairs. And around the corner. And down a hall i wasn't concerned about a soft clothes. But just a word of caution if you're gonna be installing it toward the seat in your long suite or the main bath. And there's a lot of people around just invest in the soft clothes if you go to a plumbing supply place it's about twenty-five thirty-five bucks depending. And then you can't slam the lid. And wake anybody up when you're done. So again this is just another 1400 inch bolt for no particular craziness click turn. And turn. And turn. And turn okay dear lord the guys that make these bolts i'm gonna finger tight. And then we're gonna tighten these bad boys down there is a rubber gasket on this. So say over tighten it is gonna be good to go snap your covers in place that sounds like the waters on. And quarter-turn shutoff valve it's gonna have a little bit air in the line don't let that scare you. And there we go make sure it's functioning properly. So what we want to do. Now is wait to make sure that the water fills up the tank should be marked with the water line if everything is working properly it'll stop filling if it doesn't stop filling this is your adjustment on your flute okay. So you can loosen it or tighten it to adjust how much water you have in the tank this particular toilet sarlo flow. And then go down to one point one gallon per flush which is almost nothing [music] love made some water conservation here we go right out of the factory to the water line gotta love it. So just a quick shadow to the pro flow company these toilets are available from woolsley canada i'm not sure if they're where made available anywhere else. But great value they have a the largest p-trap. And available in twilit. And the lowest amount of water available in toilets.

Then do yourself a favor. And buy quality appliances stuff like this from zee line is amazing because they have these kind of features you can do your own maintenance. And repairs you can take care of maintaining the surface of the stainless steel. So do yourself a favor spend a little extra money get good quality appliances. And you increase the value of your home. And the quality of your life. So just to bring you all up to speed with what's going on in the process here i had my plug installed here originally i knew it was kind of temporary because we hadn't really finalized the design as far as which hood family were going with we had a few options available i knew i needed power up here. And you don't have to be a plug. But it in a location. So originally we thought we were gonna be using a hood just kind of a flat bottom it would look something like this right. And then the side of the hood is gonna be very vertical. And my plug is covered by that little tower that goes with it. But it turns out we end up getting something a little bigger it has a different design it looks more of something like this all right okay problem. Now my plug is completely buried behind hood. So i had to cut a hole reach in find that power supply pull the wire loose connect it to a new box. Now it's floating because i have to put a six-inch exhaust the tower that it comes with is only nine inches wide. And you really don't want to have a cavity more than eight just to be on the safe side. So what i'm looking at doing is i want to put in my exhaust from the outside get it ready to be connected to the top of the unit which sits around here. And then i'm gonna find a location for this. And i might even just have it sitting here i don't really know yet we're gonna figure that out later there's a there is some wood up here that i can screw it to. And i'd like to have it mounted if i could. But at the end of the day once this is all installed if i have to have it sitting here it's not the end of the world because it's behind something that's all fixed. And attached to the wall. And it's completely enclosed with the cover on. So let's get into locating the outside drilling this out. And installing our exhaust vent once we have that we're going to measure off our location put in our our screws. So that we can mount the unit on the wall. Then we'll confirm the location. And then everything is level before we proceed with connection. Now you can see i'm dealing with the old wooden siding here. And there's two layers. And there's nails everywhere. So the last thing i wanna do is pull out an expensive 6-inch round drill bit. And core drill this. So what i'm gonna do instead is i'm going to use this to isolate the few locations outside. So that i can cut the siding on the outside nice. And clean it's getting cool outside. And that means that if i use any kind of cutting tool or risk shattering that siding that's gonna look like crap. So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to drill through take the grinder out cut a nice circle. Then i'm gonna take the sawzall. And i'm going to connect all the dots. And then we're gonna have a beautiful looking hole on the wall. And daylight yeah we've got a couple inches of wood to get through that's for darn sure the reason i'm drilling. So many holes is because when i'm on the outside using the reciprocate er i can just connect the dot kind of like kind of like that old little metal tracing game in school you know they give you a picture with nothing. But dots you have to connect all the dots i'll just going to take the reciprocate er. And go from one hole to the next [applause] [music] [applause] [applause] that'll burn it takes a little bit more time to be this exact. But the smaller the hole easier it is this finish nice damn okay. So we're done with that tool. Now we got to go inside figure out how much we've got to cut back off that material. And i'll show you why okay. So before we go put that in there's a couple things we want to go through when dealing with hood fans one of the concerns that you're gonna have is if you can imagine this just this being the wall. And this being the mounted head fan look how close the exhaust is to the wall. So when i install this i have to make a 90-degree turn to go at the wall. So there's my flexible ducting. And i'm gonna get relatively ninety degrees. And this is the piece that goes into the inside my wall. So i've really got to be able to get that in there a couple of inches. So let's take a look. And see if this works first okay yeah that's gonna fit inside. And i mean just freakin barely. So here's the consideration if that fits inside. And then coming off the wall a couple of inches sorry i need to make sure that my hood fan cover it's gonna leave me enough room. So what i want to do is i want to actually cut this back to about a couple of inches inside the depth of the wall. So that this isn't on my wall. And this connections happening inside my wall that makes enough sense you know it's funny because there are a lot of different hood fans out in the market. And a lot of different situations for install. And in a lot of cases if you don't buy the right product you're going to have to install your hood fan. And then do while your ducting after the fact. And you aren't going to have the flexibility that you need to make that corner make that installation this product here that comes with the z line hood fan is amazing because for me it's too long. But i have the luxury out of being able to unscrew the end measure the length that i want i'll follow the xs screw that in back on again. And i'm in business okay. So the way i'm going to finish this off later is i'm gonna be filling this cavity with expansion foam all right it's the only way that i can get anything close to resembling a good insulation level which means the first two or three inches of that cavity is going to be foam i can actually cut my tin way back inside there right. Then i can put the exhaust on screw it from the outside put on the protective seal even though there's a light rain. And it's only a couple of degrees outside the exterior caulking that we purchased there's something no problem to perform. And cure in that kind of weather scenario. So i'm more than happy to take care of that today get that all finished up. And sealed up. And then once we get this installed here i can foam this area. Then we can worry about mountain hood there you go i by cutting a nice perfect circle you got lots of meat to screw to these pieces in here just don't over compress because you'll end up distorting the siding here we go across the top a little bit on the nails on the screws sorry i'm using exterior deck screws. So they won't deteriorate. But the cocking is the same color as the hood fan. So this will blend a lot nicer. And then if it does happen to rest somewhere in the future that solves that problem. Now when you're cocking make sure you in behind the flange. And these gaps because that's where the wind is going to drive the rain. And that's how that's going to get in. So what i want to do. Now is i want to,https://youtu.be/8kYBBV4mkCk?t=0,"['What type of features should I look for when buying quality appliances?', 'Why is it important to have a 6-inch exhaust vent instead of a 9-inch one?', 'How can I ensure that my hood fan installation fits snugly in the wall?', 'What is expansion foam used for in insulation?', 'Why is it essential to seal gaps around the hood fan installation?']"

Now is i want to actually measure the height from my finished hood fan up into the screw mount. Now that's tricky. But since they give us this packaging i'm gonna just use it as my square there we go i'm gonna mark a hole on my saira phone. And i'm gonna trace the line for the bottom bam. Now i can measure. So i want to put my screws 12. And 3/4 higher than my finish of my hood thing. So let's take a look. And see what her options are. Now i want my husband to finish on the raised side of this bevel tile you can see there's a bevel line here okay i'm just gonna mark. So you can see what i'm thinking here that's the bevel. So anywhere underneath this bevel is a nice flat surface for the most part which is ideal for the hood the hood fan should be 30 to 36 inches higher. So i think. So to go in 30 we're gonna go for the 31 mark just just below the bevel line remember in earlier videos we use the laser level to put our plugs on the wall to set our countertop height to install all of our tile everything everything in this room even the windows has been done with the laser level. So by using it. Now we're gonna guarantee everything is going to be absolutely perfect this one thing you just don't want to live without. So that makes it 12 inches there 12. And 3/4 is too close to the top of that tile i think we're gonna drop it down just a bit yeah. So we're gonna wait for the bouncing to stop i'm going to trace my line or my screws are gonna go to that grim line cuz that grout line is actually my center because that's how we establish the tile when we installed it right there our center line okay. Now we'll turn the laser off because we don't need it anymore we also want to know exactly how far between the holes we are. So that's four all right the holes are centered exactly seven inches. So let's translate three. And a half inches each way. And then confirm that we got that right yep. So that's where i'm gonna be drilling to put my holes it's that simple nice [music] [applause] [applause] sweet rid of all this picture time in italy if you follow our videos you know i love using the quarter inch yellow wall plugs buy them in one pack i use them for everything that way only ever have to buy a quarter inch drill that gives you a really good grip these wall plugs are economy. Now we want to hold them off from all a little bit because it slips over. Then we'll tighten them up. So this fan is a z line snow-white stainless steel finish designed to go with my dual fuel stove. And as a result of that. Then you had to upgrade the power this up to 760 instead of your traditional 400 cfm just because whenever you're doing with gas appliances you want a little bit better exhaust okay here we go. Now some of you might actually even enjoy doing this i really am not a big fan of all of this packaging on the stainless steel i get why they do it. But the amount of fingerprints. And everything you leave on the stainless when you're taking all this off i just don't think it's worth the benefit of protecting it. But hey who am i to complain here we go okay okay wait too much cheese in it all right yeah yeah we got it run the screw mill i'll just tighten her up. So before we go any further i should mention that z-line is supplying the appliances for my kitchen just want to be perfectly honest here. Now the reason we were absolutely enthralled with the idea of doing this collaboration is appliance educator is a group of guys that are really working hard to try to develop themselves as an authority. And helping people install appliances. And they've got a youtube video. And a lot of blogs. And a lot of vlogs all about information to help people. So they contacted us. And said hey can we do a collaboration i said sure who's your favorite appliance company to deal with they introduced me to z line well they're not available in canada yet. So if you're canadian viewer be patient. But if you're down the united states they're all over the place feel free to check them out the quality is great it's a family owned company you can't go wrong with that they're made in america. So i'm really pleased. And so far this stuff is absolutely gorgeous i'm a big believer that if you're gonna renovate your own space the finishings that you put in your house your countertops your kitchens your appliances those things spend good money on that's where you get value in your home okay. So that's where the investment is put an investment in good quality finishings that's your wow factor that's your value in your home when you get an appraised. So don't cheap out into situations like this this is where you want to save your money the reason you're doing diy is that you can buy the nice things to put in your house that's where you get your valuation anyway let's carry on with the installation it has led lights it has three grills that go underneath that are dishwasher safe yay awesome awesome various speeds various lighting here's the cord it just plugs in boom all we have to do. Now is foam up around the hall. And then cut. And measure our ducting. So that we can finish this off. And install the tower the installations not that bad once you get all of the work in the wall done. So really the key is if you have the opportunity. And unlike myself have this on site before you renovate your space. So you can get all your locations perfect before you start ah otherwise this is how you do it if you don't okay i'm gonna set that there. Now this might seem pretty extreme for some folks putting this much foam in the hole remember i've gone through great lengths try to make a nice thermal. And vapor barrier around here. And if you want to see how we did it you can watch that other video i'll put the link up here it's a lot of work doing thermal. And vapor barrier in an old home. But when it's done right oh my god is it ever comfortable you know one of the benefits i almost mentioned is the the snow finish on the stainless apparently they've got special buffing pads that you can use to continually maintain this gorgeous shine we're going to try that it's shipping in the mail. So soon as we get it i think we'll try it out on the stove when we install the stove. But i'm looking forward to seeing that because that makes maintenance a brand new world stainless is lovely. But sometimes it can be a pain to clean apparently they've solved that problem okay. So let's rough to make the measurement pull the extender because if i make it too big i can always shrink it right somewhere around here like that okay. So just take these two grooves here. And line them cut it that's not as easy as it looks. So this actually goes inside my steel round i think that's going to be the most challenging part of the fit oh glad i saved the twist tie for the electrical this is going to keep that out of the way while i do the rest of my install okay sweet i'm really happy with it except for that one spot my deaf name seems to have a little bit of a hole. So i'm gonna seal that up with menthol there we go okay okay. Now for the hard part. Then when you open your package i'm gonna see this little plastic square don't throw that it's actually important cuz unlike most hood fans that are out there this one comes pretty much restaurant-quality and,https://youtu.be/8kYBBV4mkCk?t=562,"['What is the typical height of a hood fan above the countertop?', 'How do you measure the distance between screw holes in tile installation?', 'Why is it recommended to use quarter inch yellow wall plugs for DIY projects?', 'Can you explain the benefits of using thermal and vapor barriers in home renovation?', 'What are some common challenges when installing stainless steel appliances?']"

And that is actually a grease trap there's two holes in the bottom of the blower that when you take out your filters to wash you can check this out you can slide it in pour it any of the grease hyssop. And dripping inside the ductwork. And then you're right back in business again great for maintenance. Now these are the great covers for the fan is in place. And then there's a locking mechanism that's it nice. And simple. And you will notice that there is no filter in this okay we're not filtering the air here we're exhausting it. Now if you wanted to have a system where you're recirculating the air back into the kitchen. Then on the top where we out of the ducting there is a activated carbon filter you can put on that. But then you also have to get a tower that has vented size okay. So that is an option. But for me i like to exhaust the air just makes life simple basically this design is to grab grease. And dirt. And just collect it okay that's it. So that's why you throw in the dishwasher once a week whatever. And keep it clean nice. And easy.

And keep it clean nice. And easy. So this is the designer series. And the color designer basically what that means is it's a lot more difficult to install there are systems out there. Now you have an option to buy a two-piece sleeves you know one will sit on the fan when you lift up to the ceiling to screw it into a bracket nice. And simple this one there's a mounting screw here. And that actually attaches just at the top of the housing on the back of the van. And then there's this this wall plate actually installs against the wall at the ceiling height okay. And it's kind of like this in case you have an exhaust that goes up through the roof. And over through the roof since ours goes out the side we don't have to worry about the hole. But we do have a decorative trim the crown molding. So you mount that on the wall you leave just a little bit of room from the ceiling. And then you can slide this crown molding to get that finish that's the designer finish its sleek there's no joints right you can wipe it down. And clean without slicing your hand off. And on that exposed edge. And it looks pretty good. So this is what we're going to do. And because of that we have the ability to cut it to size. Now i've never been a big fan of cutting stainless steel i did go to the store. And i picked up a blade from my grinder here's hoping that it works no here's that location for the mounting screws talking about. So you want to measure from that groove up to the ceiling. Now since the crown molding is 2 inches thick we got a lot of mercy here. So for the purpose of making our cut we're just going to take a little bit off the top we'll go 18. And a half just. So we don't have any issues. Now i know i'm a safety second kind of guy. But to not wear glasses right. Now would make safety third [music] [music] citizen all right. So it's just stroke of genius the engineering here remember our screw holes are 7 inch apart to the middle of the screw this mounting flange centerline same gap 7 inches which means i can take my laser level throw it on the wall hit my screw. And then my spot on the roof is exactly the same spot. So i'm gonna put this up here not tight though remember the finished trim goes over top. So we're gonna drop it down just to here okay merc my spot i'll move the laser line to the other side do the same. And most critic did you two do this will ensure that my tower is exactly level i'm just loving it there's nothing on this wall that wasn't done with a laser level gotta buy that tool it's in her amazon linger okay. So now this was actually behind okay we'll get the set screws yeah loving that okay that's very discreet love that,https://youtu.be/8kYBBV4mkCk?t=1322,"['What type of installation is considered more difficult for the designer series?', 'How do you attach the mounting screw to the housing on the back of the van?', 'What is the purpose of the decorative trim and crown molding?', 'Why was it necessary to cut the stainless steel to size?', 'How does the laser level ensure accurate placement of the tower?']"

Now the moment of truth oh very cool okay you're interesting no i know it looks a little ugly up there reality is is my house is booed the last corset tile i installed it because i wanted to see how i'll be was. And talk about options we decided we're gonna pull this off we're gonna be putting a 3/8 inch piece of good one side plywood all the way across. And then we're gonna add a new crown molding to the both sides the room to balance the look at it's the only way we can do it. So what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this off for. Now i'm gonna get all that installed. And then we're gonna reinstate this later nice. And tight. So let's take a look at this boom nice it's got the backlighting one of the reasons why we did the herringbone tile is because we wanted a fan with backlighting a lot of times the lights are here. But that's not needed because we have lots of lights in the ceiling this is where you need your light that's awesome here's the fan we're gonna go through the different stages here this is a cooking temperature just cooking speed sorry that right there is running 400 cfm no problem at all right of course you can ramp it up depending on what you're doing if you've got all six burners or your stove going. And you got smoke. And steam. And grease flying everywhere you can crank her right up all right there you go all the power you need. And at the same time the lowest decibels imaginable this is all right. So the hood fans all installed let's take a peek at the lights. Now you're gonna notice this is a white. And this is a yellow the reason for that is i've changed this light bulb because i have a ton of pot lights in my room they're all like 4,000 color temperature. And the yellow lights here really stood out. And said hey i'm yellow. So what we're gonna show you. Now is how to replace it because we contact the z line. And they sent up some replacement lights. And the best part about this is if you're renovating. And you're doing the same thing just light here pops right up okay. And it has a little harness on it disengage it's just to click together. So you can swap out the light nice. And easy i'm wearing this headlamp. So i can see what i'm doing in here okay there you go no boom. Now everything is white light just like the rest of the house. And that is a quick easy fix. So glad the focus is uihlein figured out how to do that that's a diy repair beautiful.

And and i think is really gonna finish the kitchen how we want it informal casual beachy with the look we're going for it great the ceiling we're going to put up is from armstrong ceilings woodhaven collection it's actually a floating system with metal mounting tracks that attach to ceiling joists. And planks that are held in place with specially designed clips the first step is to cut the caulking on the edges. And joints of the existing crown molding. So that it can be removed the molding will be reinstalled later with the molding off we use a stud sensor to find the ceiling joist. And strike chalk lines to mark their location next we strike lines perpendicular to the joists at 18 inch intervals to indicate where the tracks will be located also we remove the trim rings on the recessed lights.

And i want to show you how to install a basement subfloor system system we're installing today is  made out of basically two components placed together. And they're in approximately two foot square panels with a tongue. And groove system to lock it all together. So we've got the osb top side. So when it's sitting on the floor you're going to have the osb to the top. And then it's got a plastic  base on the bottom with these these little  raised portions that just give it a little bit of breathing room off the concrete. So the idea is  if you've got a a bit of a damper basement you can put this down. And this this raised area will will give you just a little bit of space underneath it. So that  your your your concrete can breathe a little bit. And hopefully get a better chance to dry out. And and with that being plastic on the bottom as well there's really no  food source down there for mold to start growing. So so  in this case we've got a damp basement  we've pulled all the flooring out. And are going to install this subfloor down before we build our our interior walls you could can install it before or after the walls it was just easier in this case to do it after or sorry before you don't need a lot of special  tools to do this  basically you're going to need a few few little wood spacers that we need to use along the walls. And any other objects  you want to have about a/4 in space between any obstructions. So i've just got some miscellaneous pieces here to work with  these floorings as well when you purchase them you can buy  shim kits,https://youtu.be/K31nXiOEWFg?t=0,"['What is the primary purpose of the raised portions on the plastic base of the subfloor system?', 'Can the subfloor system be installed before or after building interior walls?', 'What type of tools are required to install the subfloor system?', 'How does the tongue and groove system work in the subfloor panels?', 'Why is it recommended to use a subfloor system for damp basements?']"

So it's just  a bunch of plastic pieces that you can stack. And put underneath if you need to take out a little bit of  you know a low spot or whatever in a floor. So it would be stuck under there. So as we  get going in this  i'm sure we'll come across a spot or two where we'll have to use those. And then  basic basic tools,https://youtu.be/K31nXiOEWFg?t=105,"['What are shim kits used for?', 'How do shim kits work?', 'Can you explain the purpose of shim kits?', 'When would you need to use shim kits?', 'What is the typical material of shim kits?']"

And then  basic basic tools we're going to use some safety glasses  we just need a hammer  i've also  grabbed this  pry bar that i use for laminate flooring. And we may need it just to help lock some pieces in i'm not sure. And then the other item is just a scrap piece of  of wood use against the edge of the panels. Then you hit it with the hammer to slide the tongue. And groove system together. And this is just. So you aren't banging up the edge of the panel. And and damaging it. So so you know there's not  like i said not nothing real special that you need most of the stuff you're going to all have right in your r in your home already. So so  when you go to figure this out  if you're using this this type of system with these 2 x two panels they're slightly actually under i think they the surface area actually measures  23. And a/4 i think in square. So you want to measure your room. And figure out you know how many panels you need  they basically for this particular product they say to calculate each panel is being  3.3 square ft. So if you get the square footage of the total area you're doing divide it by 3.3 that should  give you the total number of panels you'll need. And and that's allowing for waste. And that in most cases that's more than plenty. But you can always return the the parts you don't have or that you don't use. So so we're going to get  get started along this wall here before you start obviously we did some demo we pulled up the carpet the old underlay that sort of stuff. And then vacuum the floor really well. So use your wet dry vac. And get rid of any dust or anything the main thing is we don't want any contaminants underneath it  you know the whole idea here is to have nothing down there for mold to grow on we've got a little bit of the the  underpad from the carpet that was here that  we scraped it off the best we could. But there's still a little bit of that there  generally most of these underpads aren't really organic. So the the mold isn't going to eat it anyways. But so you might notice when we get right down on the floor that there's a few little spots of that  also the floor that we've got here has some old glue residue on it from  some old tiles that used to be down here i guess at one time again  none of that seems to be  spawning any mold that we can find. So i don't feel it's necessary to remove it if you did have to remove it  you're pretty much down to grinding the floor to get that off  you could try using some thinners. And strippers. And things like that. But you're just going to make a real smelly mess i think. So grinding it would probably be the best way if you if you do have to get rid of something if you do have some lumps. And bumps you want to work away at that. And try to smooth that out or if you have some real dips you can use some self-leveling  concrete in those to try to you know pre-level things out  climatize your panels for about 24 hours  in the in the room that you're going to be using them in. And then you should be good to go. So we're going to reset the camera get a few things out of the way here. And start over here okay. So like  with most  other flooring or anything that i usually do i try to start out along my longest wall if i can it just gives you a nice  straight  distance to start out with  the manufacturer of most of these panels actually usually recommends placing the what would be the grooved side against your walls to start out with  i have a bit of a problem with that because if i do that even with the tapping block i'm damaging this this tongue here sticking out every time i want to tap it without being real careful about trying to get up on an edge or something. So i like to actually turn it the other way. So that. Then when i'm putting the subsequent panels on. And using my tapping block i'm right against this solid edge. And there's way less chance i'm going to do any damage. And i i don't have to be real real particular about exactly where the the block is. So so i'm going to turn it that way i can't really see what difference it makes other than you know you might have a little bit more of a a gap  here because of the the tongue. But generally speaking your flooring. And your baseboard. And everything else is is going to cover that anyway. So if you foresee any problems doing it this direction just install yours the other way okay. So i've got these  little spacers  my these spacers are only e8 in. So i'm doubling them up to give us our quar inch  of room that we need against the this wall here these two walls i should say. And then basically this will just right in there. Now your room likely could be a little bit out of square or whatever. So you might have to play with that a little bit. And find a happy medium once you you know kind of get fitting everything together. But you know try to start out with that quarter inch space  also because of the height of our drywall we've got a little bit of a play there too we we probably don't even really need that quarter inch space  because we're gaining that under the drywall we've got half an inch there. So anyways get your first piece just kind of laying where you want it grab your second piece slide the two together. Now before you really get it really forced into where you want to be you want to try to get things kind of flushed up or or real close. So that when you  tap it into place. And it locks together you don't have to beat the heck out of it  lining everything completely ra up okay. So we've got our second piece there i'm just going to lay my tapping block on the floor. And then use the hammer against there it's kind of nice getting started here if you can put a little bit of weight on the first few pieces you've already done just to keep them from moving around on you okay. So tap it together do any little adjustments that you need to kind of get things  flushed up like. So so that's our first piece. And again like i said  because  when you start out you're going to have things moving around. So much easier just  keep track of what you've already done here for the first couple rows make sure you aren't shifting anything too bad out of place  if you really needed to you can use the odd  fastener through this you know drill with a hammer drill. And fasten down into the concrete. But i wouldn't recommend getting too many the idea is this needs needs to float a little bit. And expand. And contract  as it needs to let's get some of this stuff out of the way. And i'm just going to continue on down this row. And and it's nice to just completely finish every row. So we'll go right to the other end of the room  make our cut there with whatever space is left  if we've got a piece that's you know about 6 in wider or more we can use that piece down here to start the next row because we've got these joints right here we we want to make sure our next each each row after that staggers in those joints. So that these don't line up from row to row. And it just gives a little more strength to the floor. So we'll see what we got down there  you don't want to use usually too much less than 6 in of a piece  against the wall if you can if you can help it something  to maybe check when you're doing your initial before you start measure your dimensions. And just kind of estimate what you're going to have for a an end row or for end row pieces  you know like in this case as we're moving across here if i measured it out that was going to be a 2in little piece over there i probably would have cut you know 5 in off of this first row against this wall. So everything shifted over to make that piece bigger. But in in our case here it works out pretty decent. So so i'm just going to move right along. And keep putting these together just always pay attention to your tongue. And grooves. So that you're orientating them the right way. And don't have to take it apart it's it's not bad right in the beginning to take it apart. But once you get a few together it can be a real pain. So and all those spacers will get pulled out once we're completed i can see this this corner is a little out of square. So it's giv a little trouble with those shims down there. But you just got to play with [music] [applause] [music] it okay. So we'll  we'll just move the camera. And i'll just finish this row [music] off okay. So as i've worked along here. And i don't think i really mentioned it before when i'm putting the pieces down i'm just looking that they're kind of sitting flat. And they aren't you know rocking a whole lot  you're it's never going to be be perfect. But if you can get some of that you know the little dips out of there with these shims it's best. So i've got a little bit of a low corner here these shims are designed they just kind of stack together to  you know make up whatever thickness you kind of need. So i'm just going to  see what kind of fits under there. And see how that  yeah you can see how that took the the rock out of there. Now it wasn't much. But will help. So that when people are walking in here you know they're not going to have those little  soft spots it's going to feel like a soft spot sort of thing. So once you get the shim in just keep continuing on [music] okay. So now that we've got right down to the end. And you' seen me along there putting the odd shim in once i got to this end it was a little less less  level or true. So i've got to the end. Now now i can make a measurement here you know to the wall in a couple places see if it's even in this case it's 18 in. But remember you want to take  1/4 in at least off of there. And once we get that piece cut  you know you're going to have to kind of tip it in a little bit because you need to get it started in here you may even have to pull this one up a little bit just to help get it in there  i'm going to allow actually just a little bit extra room here. So i'm going to go probably  3/16 of an inch just to give myself that little bit more  extra room to get that in. So that measured 18 in tight. So i'll just deduct my  3/16 from that. And cut my piece you can cut this on the table saw with a jig saw with a with a circular saw anything like that. And i recommend that you cut somewhere else you don't want to cut in this room cuz you're going to be constantly cleaning up that sawdust  as you're working. So in this case we're going to be cutting right outside or right out in the shop. So okay. So i'm going to cut that piece. So 18 yeah. So actually that's going to give us a decent enough piece to start that other end. So i'm just going to go. And cut this right. Now there's no real rock et science to that we're going to show you some cutting later on we've got to cut around a a piece of wall that's out here in the middle. So i'm going to go cut this quick piece here. And bring it back in. And put it in okay. So i've got my  piece cut here to width. So we'll just  try to get the two together i think earlier i said i was cutting off 316 i meant 516 in my case. And i actually didn't have to lift up this one i thought i may have to you can see i've just got enough room there. And i've got it in here. And started. And if i give this a little bit of a wiggle hopefully i can get it started in enough to use my little bar  i need my little red bar there's not quite enough room against the wall. So i'm just going to hopefully pry it over a little with that okay. So i've got that. And then what this bar will do is i it allows me to hook in there. And hit my hammer on here to close up this joint. So you can see the joint still open a little bit like. So and actually we're we're flushed there see how we are for okay. So we looks like we got a little bit of high spot back there. So this corner is a little  floating a little bit. So we're going to need a shim here yeah that's better. So we should be all right. And i need my spacers in here okay. So i'm just. Now that i got the first row done what i like to do is go back. And just look at it make sure everything stayed where i left it. And nothing shifted out of place as far as at these joints everything stayed nice. And flush there make sure it's back against my shims. Now if that wall's a little crooked or bowed or anything. Then you know i might have to stick the odd shim extra shim in where there's a space cuz i want this to stay straight. So so we'll probably  reposition the camera again we've got our piece that came off of there when i cut it it's a little under 6 in i think it's 5. And 1 half or something yeah. But that'll be wide enough we'll use it to start our next roll okay. So we can use our  our cut off like i mentioned before to start out this next row. So we just want to get it started in there top it into place. And so get it about a quar inch from the wall. And then our next piece goes in when you're using these these shims underneath  where was it somewhere here you can see i've got a little bit of little bit of movement there  one thing you got to with a little bit if you put a shim in cuz you think you got too much movement just check further away because if it just made you know lifted up too high. And there's movement somewhere else. Then you really don't need that shim. So you know just make sure you check around that area after you've shimmed it to be sure it isn't just lifting the floor up. And creating another problem. So so that little bit of movement there like i said you're going to have some sometimes. So you just got to play with that a little bit as you go. And decide what's the best  best situation for or the best amount of play least amount of play for the situation you have. So okay. So now  this row like i said before we're just trying to stagger these joints off by about at least 6 in. So just put these panels in just like we were doing all the other ones except this time i'm not just locking into here i'm also having to lock it into there oops that's the wrong direction pay attention to what direction you're putting them. So if you just kind of get it started in both if you can. And then  you'll have to use your tapping block in  two couple different directions to  get that in there i'm just trying to get this shim in there. So that doesn't move on us okay. So just smack it around till you get things   fitting the way you want it. And then move on okay i can see  as i'm moving along here  i'm putting this piece in i'm actually opening these joints up just a bit a little bit isn't a big deal. But i think part of the problem is where i've got my wall spacers i maybe will move them to where the joints are cuz  where they are. Now it's allowing that joint to flex as i'm hitting this next row against it. So i'm just going to shift all those down a little bit. So they're all right on a joint. And that should  keep me from having that problem anymore okay. So we're just going to insert a couple different  situations where we've got to cut around some obstacles. And you know how to kind of measure it. So so right here we've got a transition where there's going to be a little bit of a jog back here to the existing carpet. So i just want to get my piece real close i'm not i don't really have it stuck right in there. But it's it's lined up. And what's that giving me for a space between there that we've actually got a quarter inch space there. So that'll actually  affect this measurement over here. So if i just come straight off this wall you know this is the obstacle i'm cutting around that's where the wall is. But now i have to remember that that piece is going to slide a/4 inch that way plus i want a/ quarter inch of play here. So i actually need to move this over 1/2 inch. So we'll just mark a line i'm going to scribble that one out. So i don't cut the wrong one okay. So that's that line there. Now the whole thing needs to slide over to whatever point we decided we wanted here  for me i want this to go over from my tongue there i want it to go over two. And a well 2. And 1 half ines. So actually i should have started out with this against the wall where i wanted it that's going to change that two. And a/4 ines okay. So i'll measure along here 2. And a4. And we're actually cutting out this piece here. So that this can slide right over okay. So we've got that all measured out around there we'll simply cut that out with a circular saw. And then we'll be able to slide that over. And it should fit perfectly where we want it  you might be just since we're right here you might be wondering you know what i'm going to do with this difference in  elevation here well actually this these panels this particular type of panel is 7/8 of an inch thick. So it's going to raise your existing floor up we don't have that panel over in this other room. So there's going to be a transition between the two on top of here we're going with a laminate vinyl plank or sorry a vinyl,https://youtu.be/K31nXiOEWFg?t=127,"['What is the recommended placement of the grooved side against the walls when using 2x2 panels?', 'How do you prevent damage to the tongue and groove system during installation?', 'Why is it necessary to use spacers between the panels?', 'Can you explain the process of staggering joints in the flooring installation?', 'How do you measure and cut around obstacles during the installation process?']"

So it's quite thin i think it's four or five or six mls or something like that going right on here. So this will end up being slightly higher than this carpet edge by probably oh an eighth of an inch likely maybe even a/ qu of an inch.

So along here i'll end up using a  a carpet bevel bar. So it's just a flat piece of metal that gets  fastened down here through the concrete. And it just makes that transition kind of a bit of an angled transition from the carpet surface up to the top of the the vinyl plank that we're using. So so your situation could be different you could be putting carpet on here carpet over there whatever you just got to use a transition strip there to to make up that difference. So okay. So we've got this one we'll cut it. And put it in after. But i want to show you one other cut as well okay. So we've  worked our way  across better part of this room. And now we've come to an obstacle here. So we've got an existing  part partial existing wall. And a. And a door frame. So we've got to cut the next panel around it.

But before i could do that what i did was  cut the  trim. And door jam off. So i just used a scrap piece of the same flooring subfloor. And i just set it on the floor. And used this  orbital saw to  cut that actually oscillating saw sorry. And cut that off. So that the new floor we can just get it slid right underneath there. And it'll be a much nicer fit. So now we need to figure out how to cut this you might have a similar situation where you've got possibly a telepost in the way or something like that. And it might even end up that that post you know is out in the middle of the sheet. So what i would do in a case like that is i would you know measure it all out cut that hole. And then run the  piece of flooring actually through your table saw. So that it is in two pieces that way you can kind of put one in. And slide the other one in from the other side. So in this case this isn't completely encompassed in this piece. So we've got a basically cut a notch i would over here on this side. So it's going to be a lot  quite similar to what we did at the other on that last cut just getting myself lined up. And close to the wall the obstacle. And what i want to do is just get basically a bit of a line here just as a guide to start out with just cuz i can't get right in underneath there where i want to be. So i'll i'll readjust that line afterwards i know i've got to be away from this this a little bit. So that'll be my actual line there. And i've got a little leeway in this case too because  there'll be another wall budding in here. So there'll be actually halfin drywall hanging off here. So i can afford to be just a little bigger that way as well okay. So on this on this first line i did here i'm just going to measure from this face back to the framing. And i've got an inch. And remember we want a a qu inch of space. So i'll i'll just move this line back 3/4 of an inch. So that's going to be there. Now i've got this kind of sitting on there i'll just measure what the difference is on the overlap here. And that's how far i need to come in there  looks like about 4. And 38 plus i need that extra quarter. So we'll go four. And 5/8. Now obviously these measurements really don't mean anything probably to your project. But i'm just trying to talk you through what my reasoning is okay. So now i can move this away i'll move this line over. So that's my cut line i don't need that one anymore. And i'm going to do that that there. So i'll just get a pencil line on there okay. So i don't know if you can see the pencil lines. But i'm basically getting rid of a rectangular shape right there. Now this one will be a little tricky again we need to kind of slide it underneath there. And then get it lined up with the tongues on on the other pieces or with the grooves i should say. And then  pound it into place. So i'm going to go  cut this one out  probably  with the using the circular saw. And the jigsaw it probably be the best on here. And then we'll bring it back. And put it in place okay. So we've just come out here to the shop. And we're going to cut  this little piece out that we just marked. So the first cut i'm going to make is with the circular saw. And i'll just plunge in. And make that cut along the line there okay. So that's one of the cuts. And i could have used that really for this too. But i'm going to use the jigs off for these guys [applause] [applause] okay. So that's that cut. And then i'll just show you while we're in here  basic cut on the table saw just straight cut for one of those end pieces. So i've got the fence already set this right here is the piece that i wanted okay. So we can take those back in. And hopefully everything fits right okay. So we're back inside we've got our piece here. So again like i said this one will be a little trickier cuz we've got to get actually underneath here. So with any luck at all once i get things lined up it might fit okay. So that drops down in there. And if i can get all those to start in which it looks like they're going to okay. So i'm probably well i definitely am bigger here than i need to be. But with our flooring. And stuff that's going to cover that. So we should be okay. But i probably could have been well that had to drop in though i probably still could have had this about an e/ inch smaller. And this tongue still would have got past. And in. But it's going to be all right like i said there's a there's going to be a a wall actually going across here forming a bit of a hallway. So that that'll be fine okay. So we got that in there we seem pretty solid i might need a shim back there when i move around to the other side. But we'll deal with that at another point. So that just gives you a bit of an idea cutting around an obstacle we're going to go back to this end. So we can get the last little bit in. And show you just finishing the  up against the second wall there. And then we'll be able to wrap things up okay. So i've just measured. And cut  a couple pieces three pieces here to finish off against the wall. So once you're you've worked your way across the room it's much like we had to do at the end there you just got to cut your piece. So it'll fit in there get it wiggled into position. And that's where this bar comes in handy again [music] i might need a shim back there this system will give you a little bit of a warmer floor as well at least they claim that. And i would think it should be somewhat warmer cuz you're getting isolated a little bit up off the concrete. So okay. So just  fit all your last pieces in there don't forget make sure you leave your off that/ qu in  space there i'll pop this last one in.

And today i want to show you how to install bat style insulation. Now this type of insulation could be used in any any framed wall we just happen to be in a basement today. But that really won't matter the methods i show you here will basically pertain to any type of wall that you're going to do. So we're obviously working on an exterior wall. And like i said in a basement  we've got  this is a particular style of insulation is fiberglass. But there's stone type insulations. And and other types that fall into this bat category that pretty much install very similar one thing with bad insulation that you want to remember is you don't want to pack it into place you don't want to compress it like that because as soon as you do this that spot is going to be a cold spot it loses its its r value there this style of  insulation actually relies on the air pockets inside the fibers to  give you the actual r value. So so just remember when you're putting it in to be gentle don't just pack it in there some people are under the understanding you know the more i can get into that space  the better i am. And actually it's completely the opposite. So so if you're using  ins or if you're insulating a 2x4 wall you want an insulation that's made for that wall. And the bags will typically say right on them what they're for. So this is an r12. And it gives you the width here in inches. And millimeters the length thickness. So there's 3. And 1/2 in in or 89 ms for a 2x4 wall. And it also tells you  how many pieces are in this bag. And the approximate coverage in square feet that you can get out of it. So okay. So so this 15 in would work in the 16in on center framing. And if you're doing 24 in on center framing it'd be 23 in wide. So that brings up one point i just want to touch on. Now that said  it it's 15 in wide our spaces here are basically going to be 14 1/2 in in the cent in between because we're 16 in center to center. So you're looking for about a/ an inch of extra width. And length to create enough friction to hold it in place. So once you get it in there it's going to stay where you want it okay you don't want it loose  too loose cuz it'll fall out or it'll have a gap where you're just going to have cold air that can travel right through. So so those are just little things that you you need to kind of be aware of   you are going to have to cut it to fit  most times it's two two pieces is too long to fill a typical 8ft wall you'll need to cut a couple inches off or an inch off or whatever the case may be be in your situation. So don't just pull them out of the bag. And jam two in there because you're going to compress it somewhere if you do that. So something else that i like to do. Now like i said we're in a basement here i've got rigid foam against the concrete walls. But let's just pretend this is the back side of the exterior sheeting on your on your wall. And anywhere else in your house behind your electrical receptacles. And switches. And all that kind of stuff there's going to be a a slight void usually especially in a 2x6 wall. But even in a in a 2x4 wall what i like to do instead of trying to get just a little bit of bad insulation behind them i'll i'll attach a piece of rigid foam depending on what thickness will fit back there cut it just slightly bigger than the actual box here. And then when i do my bad ation i just cut out for around that. And this will actually give you a little little better r value behind those boxes yeah i think that pretty much covers it you'll notice this you need this if you're on an exterior wall  this is a vapor basically a vapor box around the electrical outlet. So when you  bring your vapor barrier in you'll seal to that. And that creates your your air vapor barrier. So so make sure if your exterior while you have those on before you do all your insulating okay  i think those are the,https://youtu.be/kJZsRM1nE78?t=0,"['What type of insulation is used for this project?', 'How does fiberglass insulation work?', 'Why is it important to not compress insulation?', 'What is the purpose of a vapor barrier in insulation?', 'How do you determine the correct width and length of insulation for a 2x4 wall?']"

And then we'll  we'll show you how to do the first piece i should mention that all you really need for this is  well i'll cut this open first. And then i'll talk about that. So just cut your bag open they're fairly compressed in there. So once you open it up it's going to expand. And get rather large i'm just going to pull that out of the way  i should mention that you only need a real basic amount of  of tools. And supplies to do this really all you need is a utility knife to cut it you might want some  form of a straight edge or even a framing square  as far as safety thing safety things  especially with the fiberglass you probably want some glasses just to keep any fibers that get in the airborne out of your eyes  they recommend right on the package wearing just like a cotton  face respirator dust mask basically  i'm not going to use that today with the little bit i'm doing it'll be easier to talk without that on. But if you're doing any any amount you should have that on there some people will also like to wear gloves if they're really  you know having a bit of a reaction to the fiberglass this stuff here really isn't even that itchy. But some some of them definitely are. And especially older stuff is really itchy. So those little fibers just get into everything.

So what i'm going to do is i'll just grab out my first bat we already know these two spaces here are are a normal space. So we don't need to cut the width down  i like to start at the bottom. And work my way up. So the bottom of this piece is going to go right to the bottom plate of the wall. And i'm just going to cut out for my electrical box. And the the styrofoam that i put in there. So just take a quick measurement. And remember we want it we don't want it to fit loose we want it to fit fairly snug. So i'm going to go 11 1/2 to 15. And 1/2 that's going to be right here. So i'm just going to make a little mark like that. And about two. And 1 half oh something that actually i should mention here let me pull one of these out i don't know if you can kind of make that out you see do you see a 12 written on here right here okay that's just showing that this is an r12 bat of insulation when you're installing them try to install the bats with that facing outward. So that once it's all sealed. And everything. And they come to do your inspection before you cover it with drywall or whatever you're putting on they can see that. And they know what you've used for an r value  some inspectors i've never personally seen it happen. But some inspectors could get grochy about it if they can tell what it is. And ask you to open the wall. So if you turn that out or at least most of them i know i get going along. And i kind of forget on the odd one. But if you can at least get most of them out at least they visually can see what the r value is of the of the material you used okay. So i'm just going to cut this out okay. So just simply get rid of that. Now the other thing we've got in this situation we not only have the box. But we've got this horizontal wire here. And even these loops below bl. And above the box to kind of work around. So with this bad insulation if you just grab it approximately in the middle give a little bit of a pull it'll kind of split right in half like that. So now we can take this. And tuck this first half in behind everything that's there. And then flop this this side down. So so i'm just going to get it in behind all this hopefully my body is not in the way too much for you to see okay. So we just want to work it around make sure we're making contact down here on the bottom. And on the sides as well most times i've usually got it too low. And once i get it all in place i just give it a little tug at the top just to bring it up to where i want i just check around my box. And my wires here make sure there's no gap showing it's all in there nice flop this down get it in behind all these these flaps on this  vapor box you can see i'm not shoving in there i'm not doing this with it right cuz that's we already talked about that not being good we just want to make sure it's tucked in. And basically you know back from the surface of the wall you can see i've got a little bit of a dimple there it's actually not too bad. But generally what i do i just give it a little bit of a pull up like that i don't want to pull it too far though where i create a gap down here okay. So we got our first one in make sure it's nice around the boxes. And that's our first one. So now for the up er one  just simply take a,https://youtu.be/kJZsRM1nE78?t=330,"['What type of insulation is recommended when installing electrical boxes?', 'Why is it important to install insulation with the R-value facing outward?', 'Can inspectors visually determine the R-value of the material used in insulation?', 'How do you split and tuck insulation around wires and flaps?', 'What should be done if an inspector asks to open a wall to inspect the insulation?']"

And that's our first one. So now for the up er one  just simply take a measurement. So that's 42. So i'm going to cut this piece off at 42 and2 actually okay. Now this is where you some of you might want to use a framing square once you do a few of these you you kind of get an eyeball for what's straight. And what isn't okay. So we're cutting it off about a/ an inch longer than what we actually need needed we've got the 12 facing out just tuck it up in there get it get it sitting in here if you can't see at the top you might want a stool or whatever to. So you can go up. And check that all out make sure you don't have any gaps make sure you got a nice joint here you can't see through back into the wall there okay. So that's pretty easy right. So again. And we just want to split the bat here we don't have a box to worry about we just have the wire let bring it down flap flip this part down get all the little edges just tucked in there nice okay. So just like that. Now we're going to have another one looks like we're at the same level. And it really should be. So i can just use that as a bit of a gauge you notice i've got my knife fully extended. So you just need to be careful that you don't cut yourself with a razor knife. And again we just finish off this space just like. So you can see actually i've got a if you zoom right in you can see i've got a little bit of a space in there that we don't want that. So we need to actually bottom one can be pulled up just a bit pull this one down just a bit double check that those are all good i have a look up top i don't see any spaces there's a little spot there too it was just a fiber out of the okay. So that's your standard spaces. Now when we get over here we've  got a space that's a little bit narrower than this okay. And we've got a space that's a lot narrower plus it has these bits of blocking. And backing in there. So we need to cut those those  pieces down to to actual width okay. So basically measure it something like this that's let's say over  12 in wide or. So that/ in rule on the width. And height. And everything that works good when you get into these narrow ones half an inch tends to be a little bit too much. So i usually go just a little less maybe a quarter inch in width on those if you get it a/ inch wide on those narrow guys it kind of puckers. And and doesn't just sit in there quite right. So so we'll just  we'll just take a measurement here of what we need. And it should,https://youtu.be/kJZsRM1nE78?t=540,"['What is the typical method for cutting off excess material from boxes?', 'How do you ensure proper joints when working with framing squares?', 'What safety precautions are necessary when using razor knives?', 'How do you measure and cut narrow spaces effectively?', 'What is a common mistake to avoid when cutting narrow pieces of wood?']"

And it should be basically consistent. So we just need to  make a mark. And cut our piece lengthwise. And i'm just putting a couple guidelines. And this might be where you might want to use a straight edge or in my case i'm just using a 4ft level. Now you can see i'm compressing the bat down here to cut honestly i usually cut right on the floor or on a piece of plywood it's not working as good on the foam here cuz i can't push that hard. And i just take it right down on the floor the floor is a little harder on the blade. But so you can see that just cuts off nicely. And again we've got a wire down there. So we need to split our bat sometimes they won't split real great. But 80 90% of the time they split quite nicely wherever you grab it. So okay. So just pull this down just like we did before you can see we're getting a nice fit on the sides it's not too tight it's not too loose pull it up just a hair okay i think you got the idea for that i'm going to skip this one for just  you know it's just the same as what i did before cut it to width. And fit it in we're going to go to this one though leaving my tape measure over here okay we got a few different oples obstacles in here. So we've got  about 6. And a/4. So i'm going to go 6. And 1/2 in wide on my piece here when you make that little mark with your knife you can see it well enough to get your straight edge or whatever you're using lined up where you want it okay. So now like i said we've got a few few different things going on here we've got a wire there's going to eventually be a wall here. So this wire is actually coming out. And and needs to come through that insulation. So just get a bit of a rough idea where it needs to be we just need the height. And it's in the middle we're just going to put a bit of a slit there. So we can pass that wire through okay we also need to split the the bat. So that it comes around that we can put the   we'll do it this way. So this is going to go in here just push that through okay. So in a normal situation if if you're just insulating a framed wall where there's plywood or usb or whatever on the on the back side here right tight you're probably going to want to notch your insulation around these blocks because those blocks are going to compress it too much at that point we've actually got  well just about half an inch to an inch of space back here because of the the concrete wall being out of plum. So it's not as much of a concern down here. But i'll show you what i would normally do anyways first i got to get it in here i'm going to bring this up in here just to get it started okay we've got our piece our back piece here get it behind our wires right down to the bottom. Now because that block i've got to kind of go by feel. And where it needs to be right about there we've got our wire that we poked through there through the electrician. Now what i can do down here is easily just cut this with that block. So it just sits up on the block right okay. So we get rid of that here's our wire that'll come through our vapor barrier as well okay. Now at these blocks here if you just take your knife cut through you know about halfway or. So you can kind of see here i've got that piece just peel out the thickness that you think you need doesn't need to be this full amount. But you know this is inch. And a half. So i'd take out you know about an inch or. So and you can see how that just comes out. And fits nicely around there. And and the insulation at the backside isn't getting compressed. Now either. And losing the r value that you need okay. So that's the basic basic scenario there  on most of your insulation now,https://youtu.be/kJZsRM1nE78?t=750,"['What type of material is being used to cut the bat?', 'Why is it difficult to cut the foam?', 'How wide should the piece be for a standard installation?', 'What happens when the wire needs to come through the insulation?', 'Why is notching around the blocks necessary in some situations?']"

So that's the basic basic scenario there  on most of your insulation. Now the one thing that i don't have quite ready to show you is how to do an outside corner or an inside corner like we have over here what i'm going to do i'm just going to bring a little mock up here. And we'll just set that up. And then we'll come back okay. So in this corner. And it's really hard to see i know the glare on the poly is probably kind of bad. But we've got a stud here starting this wall we've got a stud right here that finishes that wall. And it just happened the way the space has worked out we've got another stud really close here too. So we've kind of got this type of situation right here. So here's our two bottom plates here's our two end studs on those walls here's our one that's kind of close. And this is just a regular space over here. So when you're doing this. And what i did is basically i had this wall framed i'm insulating along i obviously cut a little strip to go in here right right back here not a big deal just like what i kind of was just showing you here. Now then before i got this stud in place what i did is i put my insulation back in this corner cuz if you don't put anything in there you're just going to have frost in the corners okay sorry i should have had my mask on  okay. So i make sure there's a that's fully insulated all the way up. Now i can slide this stud over. And toenail it in where i want it to be okay. Now i don't want that space there like what i just did by hand right this stud needs to be over there needs to be enough insulation in this corner that we're we're getting that little bit of compression we need just for the friction fit okay. So nail that in you've got that all insulated. And you just continue on just like we just did. So i just i wanted to kind of show you on this little mockup  because it was just easier to show you than to try to just explain it. And you try to figure it out on your own. So so i think i think we pretty much touched on on all the basics  we do have some other types of insulation  type videos  spray foam that sort of thing that you can check out as well on different options. But pretty much this would  look after any type of bad installation that you need. So hopefully it was informative.

When the tiles arrived, one of the first things i noticed was how lightweight they were. So, before we committed to putting up an entire room of these tiles, i thought, well, why not put a couple up just to sort of get the effect. So, here's one of the tiles right here. And i've cut some  masking tape. I'm just going to roll this up here. So that the sticky side is out. And apply this to the back of the tile. And.

Laying out the tile pattern typically involves using intersecting lines to find the center of the room,. Then installing the tiles from there outward using the lines as guides. To do that, we measure each wall,. Then locate. And mark the center point. We do this on all four walls. Next, i drive in a small finish nail on the mark. Loop one end of a chalk line over the nail. Move to the opposite wall. Locate the center mark there. Pull the line taut. And snap. I repeat the process for the remaining two walls. The point where the two chalk lines cross is the exact center of the ceiling. It's also the original location of the chandelier. However, in this room, the chandelier has been moved a bit to allow it to hang directly above the dining table. I'd also like the chandelier to be in the exact center of a tile.

So, i offset the starting point to accommodate this. The tools. And materials required for this installation are simple. And readily available. Because the polystyrene tiles are. So lightweight, they can be installed using a high-te instant grab adhesive like this one. I cut the tapered nozzle. So that it will produce a medium width bead. Using the built-in piercing tool on the caul gun, i puncture the seal at the base of the nozzle. And then load the cartridge. The adhesive is best applied in dimesized dabs spaced about 6 in apart. I begin installation starting at the chalk line intersection, aligning the edge of the tile with the lines on the ceiling. Once the tile is in position, i press it firmly using the flat or palm of my hand. Putting up the full tiles goes quite quickly. Here's where having a second person to apply the adhesive can save time. And avoid a lot of trips up. And down the ladder. It's important to make sure the tiles are pushed tightly together, the corners are aligned,. And that the edges follow the chalk guidelines. To cut. And fit the tiles around the perimeter of the room, i measure the distance from the last full tile to the wall, or in this case, the crown molding. I make two measurements since the distances may not be the same. Then transfer those measurements to a tile. Align a straight edge with the marks. And cut through the tile using a utility knife. A couple of tips here. Place a sheet of cardboard or other soft material on top of the workt. This will reduce drag on the blade as it cuts through. And keep the blade sharper longer. I find a utility knife with a snap-off blade makes it quick. And easy to restore a sharp cutting edge. Making two or three passes with light pressure produces a clean, smooth cut.

And hollow inside the beams are available in a wide range of colors wood species. And sizes in this video i'm going to show you how to install these beams we'll begin by locating the ceiling joists well i've used the stud finder to locate the ceiling joists. And i've marked them in blue tape. Now if i were going to run the beams this way i could actually attach them to those joists. But in our case i want to run the beams in this direction they'll never cross over the joist. So we're going to have to use a different hanging system. Now this is a mock-up of the hanging system we're going to use these two rails or simply two by twos are going to be attached to the ceiling.

And then the beam would slip right over them like that the next step is to determine how far apart we want the beams. Then to measure. And mark the location measuring the inside of the beam tells us how far apart the outside edges of the rails need to be i'll measure half that distance on each side of the center point. And draw lines alternatively i could make up a simple gauge that's the same width. And use it to mark the rail locations the masking tape we put up to mark the ceiling joist locations can. Now be taken down i drive in a nail on the line for the outer side of the rail loop the end of a chalk line over it move to the opposite wall hold the other end of the chalk line on the edge mark there.

Now that the chalk lines are up it's time to start installing the rails i begin by marking the rails at 36 inch intervals. Then drill a quarter inch hole on the marked spots this part is best done with two people. So i ask my friend justin to lend a hand we make certain the edge of the rail is aligned with the chalk line. Then drill through the holes in the rail. And into the ceiling the rails will be fastened to the ceiling using a toggle bolt the wings on the nut will be folded back. Then the nut will be passed through a hole in the ceiling on the back side of the sealy wall board the wings will flip out preventing the nut from coming back out i'm changing the bit to a larger size. So that i can enlarge the hole in the ceiling. Then i insert the toggle bolt through the hole in the rail spin on the toggle nut pinch the wings together lift the rail into position. And insert the toggle through the hole in the ceiling next i tighten the toggle bolt until the rail is tight against the ceiling the companion rail is put up the same way making sure the edge is aligned with the chalk line the rails can also be attached using a toggle anchor like this again the hole is enlarged to accept the fastener the wing on the anchor is folded down. And the fastener is slipped through the hole. Then this cap or collar is slid along until it contacts the body of the anchor the straps are. Then snapped off this bolt is. Then inserted through the hole in the rail screwed into the anchor. And then tightened until the rail is snug against the ceiling using either fastening method the rest of the rails are installed to make sure the rails are the right distance apart i slip a scrap piece of beam over them. And check for fit with all the rails up it's.

Now time to measure for the length of the beams. Then transfer that measurement to the beam itself using a speed square. And a scoring tool i mark a line on three sides since the surface is a dark color i'm making a score line rather than drawing a pencil line since it will be more visible. Now if i were going to cut this beam with a handsaw i prefer a japanese handsaw why well it has very very fine teeth which will give me a very smooth cut the blade itself is quite thin which gives me more precision. And perhaps most of all this saw cuts as i pull it toward me which i believe gives me a lot more control with this saw i prefer to cut one side at a time turning the beam is necessary the beams can also be cut with a conventional hand saw however the quickest. And easiest way to cut the beams is with a power miter saw again the beam is scribed or marked on all three sides. And rotate it after each cut this is because most blades are not large enough to cut completely through on one pass cutting slightly outside the line. And then sanding off the excess is a good way to make a tight fit especially when the ceiling walls are not exactly perpendicular this can be done with an orbital sander or a sanding block with the beams cut to length it's time to put them up by simply slipping them over the pairs of rails if the beams are large 12 to 16 inches it's advisable to apply a bead of construction adhesive to the outside edges of the rails before slipping the beams in place the beams are secured with finish nails every 12 to 14 inches or by using finish head screws the recessed nail or screw heads are filled with colored wood putty this process is repeated until all the beams are up for added realism beam accessories like hangers brackets. And plates can be put up made from silicone polyurethane composite these accent pieces can be cut with a sharp utility knife beads of polyurethane adhesive are applied to the back. And flattened with a putty knife additional beads are added. Then the accessory is pressed into place. And held in position with finished nails faux wood beams add texture to an otherwise plain ceiling they can bring warmth. And a cozier feel to a space they can add a beautiful farmhouse look to a kitchen or a lodge look to a living room wood has always had a certain rustic charm today its warm.

And today we are talking about pot lights. And specifically how you can install them in a finished ceiling a lot of people have got a room  old wiring techniques there's one central room light today we're going to show you how to take that room light replace it with a pot light. And then add more lights in the same room on the same switch we're going to talk about what size to use the technical data around it the systems the techniques the tools the materials everything you see here it's pretty basic. And on jeff's scale of difficulty i'm gonna call this one a three all you really need to know how to do on this one is know how to cut. And measure. And just a couple of techniques for my electrical toolbox you know how to use my reds how to put the cable connectors together it's really basic i think any homeowner should be able to tackle a project like this. And it gives you the ability to go from one old ugly light to a bunch of pot lights that can be put on a dimmer that hardly costs you any money on hydro remember if you can get rid of your central room light. And go to a light like this this light only costs you one dollar a year to have it on what a deal worth the investment i think everybody should do it. So let's go over to our part of the studio where we're going to be installing this we'll show you all about what's going on. And how to space it how many lights you're going to need all the information you need to be successful your project is in this video let's get at it,https://youtu.be/pc5HWB-tyng?t=0,"['What size pot light should be used for a central room light?', 'How do I measure and cut the wiring for a pot light installation?', 'Can I use any type of switch with pot lights?', 'How many pot lights can I install on one switch?', 'What is the best way to space pot lights in a finished ceiling?']"

So people could walk in the room. And turn on the lamps if you have a house that's in that category today we're going to show you how to run pot lights from an existing source. And a finished ceiling. So you can change over your one central room light into something that's a lot more modern. And give you exactly the kind of light that you're looking for where you want it we're also going to answer all the questions about do i do four inch or six inch what's the spacing what about the angle of the beam all of these things color temperature there's a lot of information what i'm going to do is a live demonstration we're going to go up here remove a fixture we're going to fish the wire through the ceiling show you how to use a fish tape huh right all of the tips. And tricks that you're going to need you can do this. And you can do it yourself. And you can do a professional job. So let me show you how. So we're going to just jump into it i'm going to disassemble this light fixture here  most people aren't going to have a light in their house i get it this is my church i'm renovating in the basement this is our studio it's a 10 foot ceiling. So this is what i have chances are once you remove your light you're gonna have something like this in your ceiling flush with the drywall okay. Now if the box is screwed to some sort of framing from inside. And you can undo the screw. And just pull the box out great you have all the flexibility in the world you still could go with four inch or a six inch light. And you still have options if it is not able to do that because it has a bracket or screwed from the side. And you have to make a bigger mess in order to find the screws. And get it out. Then you're committing to a six inch light because this is only a four inch box if you cut a six inch hole you can take any box that's in the ceiling. And remove it. And still have a perfectly finished round hole that you can install your next fixture in. So that's why in a lot of remodeling situations with a closed ceiling it's just best to plan on using the six inch. And there's other things to consider as well we'll get into that as we build the video for. Now we're done with that. Now fluorescent lights you just rotate okay you go out of the pins cross corner. And they slide out these two pins go in. And then they roll. And they lock in case you're wondering okay you want to be real careful with these because if you break it they shatter in a million pieces. And they have toxic stuff inside them that you don't want to let into your atmosphere where you're breathing for. Now we're done with these i'm just joking [laughter]. Now all of the wiring for this unit is all in behind. And so this is actually just a piece of metal. And it's compressed under these little clips. And you just squeeze it together. And then it just pops right out. And it should expose the ballast as a side note while we're here great teaching opportunity these little clips here you see this these are actually just compressed into the middle. And you can actually swap these out. So if you have a light fixture like this it's not working anymore you can actually go to the hardware store. And buy these little units here. And you can replace them. And stick them back in. And get another whatever year is for your light fixture the ballast itself if you notice that it's dripping like this this is toxic don't touch it it's really bad osmosis toxicity going on there all right  they overheat. And they start to drip all right poison don't eat okay generally with these lights the  because the whole light fixture is a steel box you don't have to have the octagon in the ceiling. So what they do is they have a couple of mounting screws. And then just a hole in the ceiling where the wire comes down. So what we want to do first is disengage the black. And the white in the ground coming from the ceiling okay there we go that's that i don't have any cutters on me. So i'll just pull them rats okay this is all wiring for the light. And that's what we want to leave of course we're working with the power off here. Now i've got to find out where it's attached to the ceiling i got a screw here. And i got a screw here yeah here's the funny part that's not in the wood that's not in the wood this one's probably in the wood yeah that one's in the wood that's actually holding the light fixture up  like i said before i know the video is about doing it in a finished ceiling when i take this down i'm actually going to have two extra holes unfortunately. But the principle holds true all right it's just in the drywall. But yeah we got to get a thread in the middle there we go. And it's been up for. So long it's probably just glued in place.

Now this looks exactly like what you're going to find at your house after you take your light fixture out we're just going to cut back a little bit of drywall here make sure that it's easy to get this out that looks like most poop i don't know what the heck yum yeah somebody just poured mud in there to fill the hole okay here we go yeah. Now we're going to rescue this from the box. So that we can actually use this wire to put in our light there we go okay oh that's nice there's like no extra wire okay. So now we have a location this is one of these points where you start to realize how something is built okay here's a great opportunity.

But i'm going to draw on it just to give you a little heads up i can see strapping here right there i see a two by four that's just raised up going left to right i know that my joist package is going this way i don't know where it is. But i know it's going left. And right it's  five inches to the left. So my joist is here. And then my other joist is 16 inches away the red square right here i can confirm that wow it's 14. No way there we go come on 14. That means in this particular building my joists are 24 inches on center that is not what i wanted to hear. But that's still allowed as long as it's a two by ten. And it is okay good what that means is i've got joyce running this way. But strapping underneath of it going this way which means if this is my joist this is my drywall i have a space between the two that i can fish my tape around in this environment you are guaranteed you can put your pot lights wherever you want to okay there's no obstruction because all you have to do is you can run from here drill a hole over here put another light. And then we're gonna fish four ten feet away whatever it is. So we have the ability because it's strapped to put this wherever we want without damaging the ceiling if there's no strapping. And the drywall is directly to the floor joist you are going to have to make extra holes. And then patch them it's not exciting there are some houses out there the drywall is right to the floor joist package there's no strapping. So the first thing you want to do is remove your light get in here feel around right put your arm up in this space identify if you got strapping understand the construction technology you're dealing with before you make a decision about how many holes you want to build if you're going to be making a mess. And drilling extra holes the rest of this you don't have to be that careful you can make as many mistakes as you like. Now because you're going to be sanding. And priming. And painting if you're like i am. And you have one central light. And the ceiling is in perfect condition. And you have strapping. Now we're in a position let's just move forward from there because that's gonna be the majority of the situation. Now we're in a position where we can figure out how many lights we want in the room. Now we get into the math,https://youtu.be/pc5HWB-tyng?t=465,"['What is the typical spacing between joists in this building?', 'How does strapping affect ceiling installation?', 'Can you install pot lights without damaging the ceiling?', 'What happens when drywall is directly attached to the floor joist package?', 'How do you determine the number of holes needed for a light fixture?']"

Now we get into the math this room sealing the ceiling is almost 11 feet generally speaking when you figure out how many lights you want you want to take a look at three considerations let me just grab the package. Now you can get a four or six inch light with the same amount of watts okay the size of the light doesn't mean how many watts because they're led. So what you want to do is you want to get at least the 15 watt led which is like 100 watt light bulb. Now when you look down here the information there's a piece of information along the side here bam okay here it is it shows you how long it's gonna life last sorry. But on the back over here it shows you the angle see this beam angle crucially important because this beam angle here tells you how the light works this box is 120. The other light that i have is a 38 alright. So just for fun i'm going to demonstrate what those two angles mean. And why it's. So important to know this because it'll tell you how many lights you're going to need in your room okay. So i need a screw i got a chalk line this will help make this visual visibility really easy okay. Now this here it's about 120 angle beam okay that's about a 90 that's about 120 makes sense. So if you have this beam. And you're in a 10 foot ceiling. And let's say i'm at average height just under six feet my light is passing here if i'm walking in this part of the room. And i don't have another light fixture with the beam coming along. And intersecting it above my eyes i'm effectively going to be walking in. And out of the light into the dark all through the room. And you've maybe been in a place like that it's like spooky basements have this happen a lot people don't use enough lights in a basement it's usually a lower ceiling it's lower than eight feet. Now at ten feet you can probably as long as my intersection is from here i'm probably good right. So i could have lights as far as six feet apart on a ten foot ceiling if it's an eight foot ceiling you wanna put your lights no more than four feet apart okay. Now having said that four feet is a lot of distance. And you might not want to have just four feet apart you might want to bring even more lights than that okay it might be easier for you to fish that along if instead of every four feet you went with every three if i went if i didn't have strapping on with the two foot joists i could go a light every two feet right all the way down the run. And put it on a dimmer switch. So i can reduce how many how much power i'm putting into the room that's one way to work around a situation. But for normal situations i like 36 inches of spacing i like 24 inches off a wall because remember you're talking about the angle of that beam you don't want next to a wall. And the light only hits way down low. So i like 24 inches off a wall every three feet after that i like to fill the room if you've got a tall ceiling go every four feet okay it's not that tricky it is easier to have more lights. And reduce the dimmer effect than to not have enough light in the room it really screams when you have those dead zones. And you look around you go from bright to dark in the room it really says somebody didn't think this out very well. So hopefully that helps. Now let's get into the actual wiring situation okay. So my light is five. And a half feet from the wall. So what i'm gonna do is put a little pencil mark two feet okay. And i wanna make sure i'm kind of square about there okay. Now that's where i want to put my light this is an easy one to do because i'm inside of a joist cavity the only thing i've got to find out is am i marking where that strapping is because i don't want to have to cut through this dropping. So let's find out. And we do that we just put our stud finder here if it goes red there's wood there's wood here yeah there is okay good. So if the stud is over here the strapping is over here we're gonna be safe there this particular box it gives you information for cutting okay all the information you need about your light is on the box read all four sides this isn't serial there's like actually tons of information here this light says here that the hole should be six. And one-eighth of an inch. And the light itself is six. And three-quarters. Now that's not a lot of mercy. Now if you have a six. And one-eighth inch hole saw you'll never find it. Then you're great. But what they do is they give you this it's the packaging the light came in the box. And it was sitting in this hole. So we're going to double check. And this packaging the hole is five. And three quarters. And i want six in something okay. Now you can use this as a template put it up on the ceiling right. And you can do your circle with it okay. And connect the dots here. Now you want six. And an eighth. And so you can kind of split the difference here okay you see that i'm basically adding 3 16 all the way around the circle that's all.

And you can basically freehand that circle. Now 3 16 or knowing you're going 3 16 just pull out your saw. And cut the darn thing. So i'm going to cut on the inside of the line. And i hit something lovely that's going to happen folks we'll deal with that when we get there. And a warning when you're using a drywall saw to cut a hole like this cut on the upward thrust not on the downward thrust because you risk tearing the paper okay. So if you're only pushing forward when you're on the upward thrust you'll never tear the paper off if i'm pulling down while i'm cutting i can run a bit of paper off. And then i'm no longer have a finished ceiling [music] let's find out how much of this what is in the way okay we're gonna finish the rest of this with a utility knife great teachable moment all right okay here we go one of the benefits of these lights is the main body of this light is not as thick as the drywall okay. So even though i've exposed wooden that's in the way i don't have to cut through that structure or compromise it as long as i've got two locations where i can put these pins when i'm ready okay. And get the wire tucked up out of the way we're gonna see if this is gonna fit. Now okay that actually works really nice when you see the spring take your knife. And push it up there. And open up the open up the spring by pushing in take the pressure off the drywall. So you don't tear it okay there we go.

And a white it's all you need for light fixtures the only time you need to go with the three wire is if you have a three-way switch. And the wiring of the fixtures goes three wire from the switch to the light. And then to another switch if that happens if you open this up. And you see a black white. And a red. And it's on a three-way switch that's what they're doing okay. So then you'd have to continue that going three. And connecting all of those wires in every box black. And white to the fixture. And red merited to itself. But for most situations what you're gonna find is two just the black. And white is going to do the job most guys that wire a three-way switch wire switch switch.

And i'm going to cut a little bit wider than what you see if you're one of these people that likes to be really precise with stuff go ahead be as precise as you want right cut a template that's exactly six. And an eighth don't worry about it there's nothing wrong with that i just  i know i've got a little bit of wiggle room.

Now we gotta do is fish it. Now if you're inside of a joist cavity. And you want to just push a wire across you probably can get away with that not all that tricky all right let's see. And boom okay. Now this wire only comes. So low no sense making this wire any longer than that one. So like i said depending on your room your size your shape you can put as many lights as you like i'm going to do one more. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my pencil. And hold it where my end of my tape is. And i'm going to come over to where i find four feet okay put that in the center of the hole make a little mark my center line here is going to be two feet there we go let's just put our box based on this we'll trace our cardboard. And we'll cut the hole a little bigger than the circle we're probably going to end up with a strapping in the same spot again. But that's fine there's two reasons i'm recommending when you're doing this in a finished ceiling to go to the six inch light one of them is that like i've just demonstrated it's a lot easier to get your arms in to work around to fish around in a six inch length in a four the second reason is what if the hole that we were drilling was right over a floor joist okay in a lot of cases the  the packs that come in the lights. And with a four inch hole can't get between the drywall. And the floor joist okay. And that's a challenge that's a real problem. So by going with a six inch light even if there's a floor joist right in the middle there's enough room to slide this up beside it drop it in the ceiling. And then connect your wiring okay. So that's why i'm suggesting you go with the six inch light if you don't know what's going on because it gives you options for all the installation later. Now as far as working with the fish tape i'm gonna suggest you always start at the end. And go back to where you were the way this works is the rod the tape kind of pulls out of the handle. And you'll see the whole carriage is moving around okay. And when it's time to close it all up you hold this. And you grab the grab the wheel. And you turn it together. And that's how you bring it back in. And because it's round it's always in a loop. So when you put it in the ceiling because it's a flat tape it'll just travel across the drywall until it comes to the hole. And if it meets with any obstruction you can flip it over. So here we go i'm going to go underneath the floor joist. And just push it in the general direction where i want it to go should just pop out the other side there we go all right. Now we want to have enough wire for this light right. And over to here. And then put the dangle down i'm not going to let go of my tape all right. So then all we got to do is tape this wire to the fish tape. Now now if i just pull this out enough i can set it there. And it won't fall out of the ceiling there we go okay here we go secret here cut the last couple inches of the sheathing off cut your black. And white wires okay make this a hook because that's a hook you simply hook them together we're not going very far. And i don't think there's any obstruction. So i'm not going to bother taping it. But in the event that you're going through weird spaces. And you had to fight to get the tape somewhere you would just take electrical tape. And tape this all together okay i'm just going to pull it through like this [applause]. Now i'm going to help it over the corner [applause] okay when you're pulling try to be on one end lifting it off the drywall okay. So you're pulling it across. And on the other end you want to be pulling straight across the hole if you're putting too much downward pressure you can break the drywall remember this is the finished ceiling. So the last thing we want to do is break the drywall here right there we go. So now i've got enough wire here to make my connection. And enough wire here i just disengaged,https://youtu.be/pc5HWB-tyng?t=1284,"['What type of wire should be used for fishing in a joist cavity?', 'Why is it recommended to use a six-inch light when drilling into a finished ceiling?', 'How does the fish tape work and how do you close it?', 'What happens if the hole drilled is right over a floor joist?', 'How should you pull the wire through the drywall to avoid breaking it?']"

And enough wire here i just disengaged all right. So now we're just going to go through the steps to wire you want to have about three inches of wire exposed okay here we are. So you need your alpha knife you're going to need a wire stripper. Now wire stripper comes with the gauge. And these numbers correspond with the wire itself we're using 14 2. So you find the 14 hole. And then you set that in the 14 hole. And about three quarters of an inch with the wire a pinch. And a little twist there we go. And 14. Okay all right. Now for prepping the box pop the door open i can put a grommet on the end or either side i always like to go the end opposite of the wire because it's just a good habit to get into in case you're fishing your wire through in an odd spot it makes life simple you're right yeah. Now they don't come with the grommets you're gonna have to go. And buy a package okay they come in packages of fiber you can buy buckets of these things right. And here they are they're just a little half inch plastic okay take your square nose cut off side cutters give it a little love tip. And then you pinch it. And just wiggle it. And it'll snap off okay. Then you stick it in the tape short tapered side. And you squeeze it to close it. And then you set it in. And that's it it's not going anywhere here's a cross section of the grommet you want to push your wire through. So that that tab is bent down out of the way. And then it's in there pretty fixed. So it holds the wires you want to get that right to the sheathing okay. And there's my other one right until the sheathing up here is inside that little grabbing section okay here we go pay attention inside of the box as well all right get these out of the way here. And we'll just curl these. So there's lots of room all right here we go. Now now i want to push that sheathing until i see it sticking out inside the box okay. Now you know you've got a good grab that's not coming off by accident all right. Now it's as simple if there's one or two wires it doesn't make a difference you just take the corresponding green wire goes with the copper all right shove that on there. And then the white one goes with the white one. And then the black one goes with the black one wiring couldn't be any simpler there we go. And that is why i'm a big proponent of a residential homeowner's electrical certificate you could take a course. And anybody should be allowed to wire their own house as long as you know the black. And white go together ninety percent of the time i don't think we'll ever see it. But hey it would be nice see okay the only thing that's left is to attach see this groove here there is a corresponding bump. And you have to put those together in the right location. And they slide together. And then you twist this on. Now you know you've got positive contact we can slide this up into the ceiling [music] okay. Now take the first tab. And put it up against the drywall. And then take the second tab push it around. And then it'll all just snap right in there here we go i'm gonna go. And turn on the light we'll see how that worked okay max let's turn on the power there you go wow that is beautiful light right. Now this flight is set at  wow that's a 5 000. All right that's 4 000. And that's 3 000 kelvin okay. So you get to decide if you have other lighting in there in the area. And you've got to match it up that's like traditional incandescent lighting that's more daytime lighting. And that is the blue lighting right. So you get to pick this works amazing the new technology on led lights gives you all that flexibility in case the design trends change down the road these lights last for years. And i would just okay all right guys well this that's how easy it is couple of hand tools. And you can add lights to your own ceiling it's a really great way. And you can take this technology. And you can adjust it to whatever you're doing on the difficulty scale this is like a three you got to be able to cut. And measure. And you got to connect black. And white it's not that tricky anybody can do this at home. Now if you aren't aware of all the different led packages that are available in the market all the different lighting schemes that you can get they have replacements for traditional fluorescent tubes. And for drop ceilings.

So let's just jump right in this  generally speaking i like to work from the top down which means lighting. And that is easy because if i do the lighting. Then i can turn the lights on all right. So because we have the camera here today we have artificial lighting we have our own lights i'm not going to worry too much about that. So i'm going to install one of these light fixtures. And i'm also going to install a mirror. And i'm going to use a laser line for this okay because we are looking for perfection here whenever you're doing a project you want to use the center of your faucet to be exactly the distance middle distance between your light fixtures all these kinds of things you really want to think end from the beginning frame everything put your boxes in with the end goal in mind okay. So right. Now we've got this all set up. So it's double sync two oval mirrors. And the gap between the light fixture. And each mirror edge is exactly the same on all along this wall. So i think we're going to get a great finish this is my center line i've lined it up on the sink here. And what we're going to do is well what's easier for the camera i'll get on this side of the line how's that. So i've already measured this off to be exactly center of between the two light boxes. And it's right on my tap which is what it should have been  if you're not sure how i came to that conclusion you can watch the previous video video on how to go from a single to a double snc okay pretty sure we cover all the information about how to line up your boxes going to put a reference mark here just in case i end up kicking the light as i go along okay. So this is our mirror it's nice oval see that's why i put that pencil in there i'm going to want to have that for reference. So we will put that back. And straddle that okay what i'm doing. Now is i'm just going to go. And look for what looks the best right i don't need to see this ceiling. And i'm  510 1/2 5'11 in my dad's shoes all right. So i'm going to bring it down just a bit this is good my thumbs are actually about 2 in below where the the electrical box is i like that i can see everything i'm wearing i can see right to the counter top i think that's going to work out well. So we're going to keep that in mind. And we're going to take a look at the light fixture that hole mounts right in the middle of the box. And the light centers a little bit below this. So that means the center line in this mirror should be about an inch. And a half below the box. So that's a good spot right okay. Now what i can do with my laser. So i can raise this bad boy up. And the reason i love to use this is because i'm doing more than one mirror if you're only doing one mirror you can do all kinds of cheating here. But when you're doing two you got to have a system that you can duplicate cuz you can see the hooks on the back here these are designed to put in two screw plugs in the wall. And you hang it on the screw there's not a lot of mercy here. So you got to get this pretty dead on. Now there's my laser line about 2 in below the box we're going to call that the center okay. So now i'm going to find the center of my mirror about there okay i'm going to put a line all right here we go from that line i'm going to go 9 in. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to measure up 9 in from here this is going to be the height of my hooks. And this is my center line right here we go. And my hooks my screw heads are going to be 7even. And 3/4 in apart well that's just brilliant. So let's change this again bathrooms are always. So much fun because there's never enough room in here to really function okay 7. And 5/8 if you're not good with math you take your 7. And 5/8. And you just fold your tape over okay. And then you can read right there it's 3. And 78 okay. So i'm going to put three. And 78 on my red line make a mark 7. And 5/8 make my other mark there we go. Now all i got to do is make sure that that line is level. And i don't need a laser for that there we go there. And there. Now the only other thing you need to know. Now is if there's a stud there. And if we don't have a stud. Then we know we need a wall plug. So you put your stud finder out against the wall. And then you press the button. And when it says ready which is the green light start sliding there's a stud there. So i'm right on the edge of a stud that's going to be tricky. And wow i have another stud here very unique huh. So whether it's a stud or some other obstruction i'm not exactly sure i know my plumbing is in the center of the wall. And it's horizontal here for the vents. And i'm not not sure what's going on there. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to do an exploratory hole with i'm going to use my my robertson bit this is a safe way to check there's nothing here that's sharp enough to penetrate a plumbing line or electrical line i do damage. So since we're not sure we're just going to start like this yeah right off the edge okay. And then this if i'm putting in a screw there it's going to go. And it's going to be very very unique here i actually have stud in this case i don't need wall plugs what i do need to do is just put a plug here. And leave about  316 of space between the head of that screw. And the wall. So that that hook can go on. And over here i'm going to cheat i'm going to drill in an angle. So i get positive contact with that stud. And the goal is to have that screw head line up where i want it when i'm done bam loving that all right. Now there are two ways to mount these mirrors right you can take a airline wire. And you can buy a little mirror hanging kit at the store. And you wrap it around each end. And then you only put one screw in the middle. And you can set your mirror on. And you can level it off. And that works great. But when you have two you can't do that because they'll never be level. So this is why we've got to do it the oldfashioned hard way way what you want to do is get your fingers on here if it's stiff enough you can set them like that. And forget it great stand to the side just line them up there we go boom. But that's going to work great. But the se the secret here is taking this information. And transferring it over there. So what we have to do before we move forward okay is get this horizontal line on again. And we want to take this information. And we were 9 in above yes. And i want to come over here off the center mark i want to mark my 9 in above okay. And then i'm going to want to bring my laser level over off the center hole mark this get a center line measure both directions again. And do the same thing okay. Now let's move on to the,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=44,"[""['What is the author's preferred method for working on a project?', 'How does the author ensure that their light fixtures are evenly spaced?', 'Why is it necessary to use a laser level in this project?', 'What is the purpose of measuring 9 inches above the center mark?', 'How do you properly hang two mirrors with a laser level?']""]"

And do the same thing okay. Now let's move on to the light fixture i already know because this is my house. And i wired this that the power goes with that box. Then that box. Then over here. So i'm starting at the end i'll work my way back over there. And when i'm doing the the first light in the series i'll double check make sure the switch is off. So i don't have any power in it right. Now i don't know. But because it's not connected i know there's no power in this. So just as a precursor. So you know i'm not working crazy with the power on not that that makes me nervous. But for today's video we'll assume i'm saying all right here we go this particular fixture comes with a few elements always open up your packaging before you go install you'll never find light bulbs in a light fixture box in most cases okay. So we've got lens we've got the mount with the wiring. And we've got a mounting bracket okay. And then this little ring here is what's used to tile these together. And once it's connected. Then you add the bulb afterwards. So let's just go through the process first of all we're going to need a robertson screw bit which we have because these screws are the mounting screws for this plate. And what we want to do is bring the wires through the middle nice. And easy there we go. And because we're mounting through the middle off of this bracket anywhere where we can set this where it's going to install easily we're going to go with okay you don't have to go with one of the little holes you can use one of the big ones. And adjust it over time doesn't really matter these brackets are designed to be incredibly functional. And and actually incredibly versatile you can even mount this round box on an old rectangular box. And turn that into a light if you get if you need to all right cuz it has all these different options for mounting here we go. So i got my neutral i got my power. And i got my ground. And for good measure we're going to back out the ground screw. And then tighten it on if you wire clockwise. And you tighten clockwise everything tightens when you use the drill if you put it on the wrong side it'll all just fire right out of it okay you're going to run in all kinds of trouble look at this this is cute eh like i was saying earlier you don't want to be doing all your fixtures. And stuff until your paint has been drying for a couple of days it needs to harden every time something bumps into it it'll make a dent or a scratch or mark. And you can't wash it off remember you can't wash your washable paint on your walls until 30 days after you paint cuz that's how long it takes it to cure before you can wash it oh jeez careful jeff careful here we go. So you can see how i'm wrapping it around that wire a lot trying to guarantee positive contact long term after this install is over hey that's enough of that there boy all right here we go. Now i'm going to take this wire. And i'm going to  do that as well i know this is overkill because these screws make this plate grounded to the box. But you know going a little overkill isn't going to hurt anybody in this situation. Now you really want to figure out where your wires are going to go here okay. And you want to kind of connect everything around free from obstruction. And this is only 1/4 inch thick. And i've got almost an inch of this threaded rod sticking out. So we're going to tighten it back up. And i'm going to stick this on why is that only going in there we go almost cross threaded that max that would have really sucked okay. So i have another problem here that i'm going to have to do with. Now can you imagine can you guess anybody guess in the comment section that's right i used the pan box. And for whatever reason they decided to give us a 3in bolt for mounting this box like that's the bolt needs to be an inch long here looks like it's making contact with the ground wire in there let's move that out of the way there we go. Now we should be able to get enough of that thread it in there to make enough room all right sometimes the thickness of the ground wire is all that it takes i'm liking my odds here yes sir that was it. Now we're going to polish this up this is a great time to check for stickers by the way the sticker is actually on the ring sometimes it's on the light fixture. And have a stickers telling you information about the light bulbs you can use you want to remove that sticker as soon as possible in the old days we used to have incandescent light bulbs. And got really warm. And those stickers would always leave a nasty residue if you turn the lights on before removing them electricians are famous for not removing stickers off of light fixture. So be careful about that all right as it turns out i bought some led light fixtures light bulbs holy crap are these ever huge that's a lot of bulb just wanted 60 watts i didn't realize i had to get something as big as my car there we go that's the light fixture installed yay  i would show you at work. But we'll show you in the end of the video okay we we'll make sure that we do an aftershot of the whole room. So you get the whole idea here we go on to the next fixture we don't want,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=506,"['What type of screws are used for mounting the light fixture?', 'Why is it recommended to wait until paint has dried before installing fixtures?', 'What happens if a screw is tightened in the wrong direction?', 'How long does it take for washable paint to cure on walls?', 'What should be done with stickers on light fixtures?']"

So you get the whole idea here we go on to the next fixture we don't want to waste any of your time. So regular well plug  we got a lot of wire here okay you're going to grab the end. And all you do is turn it it creates a nice hook okay it's easy to work with this okay you set it on one side of that box. And you can pinch the wire shut. And then you just tighten it on okay piece of cake. Now generally on almost every fixture you get the screws on the side with the ground are always the whites all right. And brass. And black okay white. And the silver. So the way you remember this is the brass. And the black go together i think i did a video of this before. And i got that wiring combination screwed up i wasn't always incredibly comfortable on camera my brains would scramble here we go. So we're going to have this is part of a circuit. So this power's coming in. And going out all right. So generally what i like to do is do the whites first okay again you pinch the end. And you curl a hook into it all right. Now i am not a master electrician by any stretch. But let's just be honest you don't need to have a master electrician to wire a receptacle any more than you need an engineer to drive a car down the street this stuff is not that tricky. And anybody who's doing their wiring wrapping the wire around the screws is already miles ahead as far as integrity is concerned cuz on the back they have these little holes push. And play like you can just push the wire in there i'm telling you right. Now if you want to do nice wiring job at your house don't use those holes yes they're convenient wow that's really long yes the holes are convenient. But they are known to fail get a loose connection. And then you can't ever pull them back out you have to cut them off which means you have a live piece of wire sticking out of the back when you go in the box next time. And you increase the risk of problems. And starting fires. And all that business just put a wire on a screw all right. And stop being lazy if you spend your whole career. And you stop one fire from happening as an electrician because you do this versus the plug-and play it was worth the time you took okay let's do this  talk to me are you the  oh my god explo light upside down or are you more like this kind of look which do you prefer i like to make them look like a face for whatever reason the  the human brain recognizes that. And it finds it more aesthetically pleasing if you think i'm wrong let me know. But i've had long conversations with people about this before there is no actual right way. And wrong way here all right the secret is you push it to the wall. And then you tighten it up [music] okay don't overtighten because you'll push this too far inside. And then the wall plate won't cover nicely speaking of wall plates if you do a decent job with your drywall. Then you won't need to use oversized plates you can get the normal size if however you have too big of a hole because of your remodel okay you don't like that you can always push them around just a little bit there we go got to love a good alan knife as long as you got a knife on you you never need a screwdriver. And again these screws go vertical okay aesthetically pleasing,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=892,"['What is the purpose of using wire hooks when wiring a receptacle?', 'How do you determine which wires are white, brass, and black?', 'Why is it recommended to use a wire on a screw instead of the holes provided?', 'Can you make a lighting fixture look aesthetically pleasing by designing it like a face?', 'What happens if you overtighten a wall plate while installing drywall?']"

Now we can jump on to the faucet before we do we'll talk real quick about the gfi all right okay gfi all right they have a few different versions out here the idea is  if something horrible goes wrong it turns itself off that's all you need to know as a homeowner on the back again you got brass. And you got silver you got a ground screw. And you have this little tape on section okay if you're only bringing a single pair of wires a black. And a white you wire it right here. And if you want the circuit to continue from here you remove the yellow tape. And you put the black. And the white here. And that carries on to the next fixture wow that was complicated huh listen the technology is all in the switch you don't have to know anything different  that plug down there cost $195. And this one cost $28 you got to trust the technology don't wire it backwards or you most likely will kill it. And then you have to spend another 30 bucks for a new one they're a little bit sensitive let's just set these wires up. Now this is contrary to common sense this one's actually live  i'm just not in the mood to go downstairs. And do this right. Now we are going to wire the whole switch right up to the last live wire. And we'll do that one at the end all right again we'll do the ground first oh neat all right my bad these don't need hooks see that max these have got a  a big brass plate. And the screw released makes hold to slide the the wire straight in cut them all back again. And we're just going to go with whatever the recommended distance is for this nice not too long you don't want to have exposed wires sticking out of the back of the box well this is actually going to be a lot more entertaining than i thought. So you have to hold it upside down in order to release the plate. And then you can turn it over tighten the screw good. Now we're going to do the two whes. Now this is the one with the power okay. And this is the one where the power comes in okay. And we interesting system they got here all right. Now both of these screws are all the way through to the other side of the brass all right flip it over okay. Now it's time for some safety precautions because we're going to deal with a live circuit i'm going to wrap all of the screws in electrical tape okay perfect loving it. And here's the reason why if you touch a live wire you don't electrocute yourself cuz there's no circuit until it connects to the neutral. So if i can't come in contact with the neutral wire i can't complete the circuit loving it eh. So now we're going to take the live power off. And we're going to cut it back a little bit cuz it's a little long we're going to treat it with a healthy amount of respect here if anything goes wrong here it's on me. So what i want to do is get rid of this i'm going open that gate up okay i'm holding the tab at the end cuz these two are always safe even on the live situation okay good all right. Now let's hit the reset button. And the little light should turn on oh i guess the power wasn't on after all right on okay i'll have to go down. And turn the breaker on always better to treat it like the power's on. Then you'll never have to worry about someone like let's say  one of your sons going downstairs. So they go downstairs. And they go oh that one's not working that must be mine yeah that happens. So the other thing you can do is have a little proximity tester little green stick on you or something all right right. So i just threw my laser level on the the mouth of that plug. And it's on the mouth of that plug. So the boxers are perfectly level what we have here is going to be really common this countertop is not installed level there's a nasty slope it comes with these beautiful big feet on it that didn't give us the ability to level it off to perfection what we have is flat,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=1117,"['What type of screws are used for the faucet?', 'How do you wire a GFI outlet?', 'Why is it important to use electrical tape when working with live circuits?', 'What happens if you touch a live wire without completing the circuit?', 'How can you ensure that a countertop is installed level?']"

And pretty darn level as a result this plug is a quarter inch lower towards the countertop than this side. And i have a stone backsplash. So although it looks great it's going to be an issue as soon as i put the back on. So what i've got to do got to raise this bad boy up because i need 4 in of clearance right. Now i only have 3. And 7/8 okay. So now i get to show you how to fix this as a diy renovator you're going to want to follow a lot of these little tips little systems that i use okay here's one of my systems that i use when i mount my boxes i mount my boxes with one screw on a 45° angle from the middle going into the second hole all right here's why look at the size of this cover plate okay right i've got got almost a half an inch of mercy here that i can play with. So dig right in here mix. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to cut out drywall. So that i can raise the box. Now this particular box has got the set screws on the inside of the box which is brilliant. So when you're shopping you got choices the boxes come with the set screw on the inside or there's a little flange on the top. And the bottom whatever you do make sure you always set it. So that you can maneuver it to a new [music] height okay. Now up we go right on okay again let's get the mouth working let's prebend the wires. So they collapse properly. And finish vertical. Now listen this is kind of like best case scenario everything's brand new everything's already flat. And level you know using a laser level works. But as soon as you have to start modifying things to fit a space like we did with the vanity. And you can watch that in the other video that we did about how to go from single to double vanity really this should not be that difficult for a screw okay here we go. Then you'll appreciate the amount of effort. And energy that goes into making this look good i'm only off half a degree maybe one degree tops over 6 fet. And that eighth of an inch is the difference between me doing what cutting the plate what's the other option here cut the stone i'm about to stick on no the option is lift this up. And make it look like it's set at the same height it's not going to be the end of the world it's still going to look perfect when you walk in. And nobody's going to walk into your bathroom with a laser go aha you're out of 16th of an inch.

So there we go problem solved listen because we have lots of room we're going to do the backsplash. Then i'm going to add the silicone seal. And then i'm going to put the faucets in  why the heck not right let's just make life difficult for me we work top down. And back front  i would suggest usually most cases putting the faucet first. But i'm down for a challenge today. So i'm going to go get the backsplash. And i'm going to teach you how to mount this. And no you can't just use anything you got to use the right stuff. So let's just do a test on this first see how it looks that's upside down we really don't want to start in the wrong direction there's a polished. And an unpolished edge here this is natural stone i think it's a quartz all righty look at that that's pretty darn awesome you can tell gravity does most of the work here right when you go to install. So anything that's a stone follow the same procedure like as if it's natural stone if you treat everything like marble you'll never make a mistake marbleous porous different products have different paracity. And you can attach things with white silicone black silicone clear silicone pl premium. But sometimes the wrong combination of those adhesives will cause you to see the adhesive staining through the stone. And you'll end up with a big squiggly line. And then who's going to look like an idiot eh. So might i suggest the best process here is to just lay it down. And you don't even have to get too close to the edge okay gravity is going to do most of the work here all right. And we're going to just slide it into place there you go. So i don't even know if i'm happy with that i might have to take this off. And just raise it up another quarter inch to get a bit of a gap resist the temptation to press it into the wall most walls have got a bit of a bend. And a wave to it okay come back with your clear silicone. And just throw the tiniest little bead right against the top. And if the hole opens up just make it a wider bead the reason we're using clear is cuz it's a prepainted surface okay. And you'll see the paint through the the silicone after it dries. And you won't really be able to tell the gap. Now don't use just transparent the transparent stuff gets a little cloudy white. And it never looks as nice. But the clear always comes out looking more like a window like a piece of glass all right. And when you do this you want to have the side of the finger pressed against the wall. So that if it squeezes anywhere it squeezes onto in behind the stone okay you see the gaps unacceptable always managing your silicone. And your drips all right get a bigger hole. And then open up the w the hole that wide. And then just do a second pull close that gap if you fill it properly you won't get those shadows. And stuff from the product not making contact with the back of the stone in behind it i know that looks a little funny right. Now but let it dry. And it almost totally disappears that's how you fix an imperfect world clear silicone do not touch that again once you put silicone somewhere do not work above it for at least 24 hours all right or 12 like don't be nuts. But at least 12. Now we're also going to want to put a little bead right down here to prevent water from getting in between the backsplash. And the countertop. And this is just a thin bead nice. And easy always managing the tip of that silicone this is where having the faucet here first is difficult trying to manage that look at all the difficulty i'm having here turn your f water on use your finger to drive it okay there we go,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=1640,"['What type of adhesive should be used for mounting a backsplash made of natural stone?', 'Why is it recommended to work top down when installing a backsplash?', 'What happens if the wrong combination of adhesives is used for a stone backsplash?', 'How can you prevent water from getting into the gap between the backsplash and countertop?', 'What should be done after applying clear silicone adhesive to a natural stone surface?']"

Now we're going to move on to the other faucet in case you didn't see me inst saw the faucet on the going from 1 to two vanity video okay we're going to do the quick version of this for the extended version you can watch the video where we went from not one vanity to two. But one sink to two sinks we changed the plumbing we opened the wall we did everything re-rooted it all right. So it's worth a watch because one of the ways you can increase the value home is if you have a single vanity in your master bath change it to a double his. And hers right easy money okay. So here we go i just tried to remove what i saw was a foreign obstacle in the drain it turned it be a piece of that broken glass from that damn light i wanted to show you. So reached down. And pushed it with my finger. And guess what it didn't move. But the finger did that really sucked. And there we go i just saved $1,500 in hospital bills okay just joking i don't have to pay for mine up here. And i didn't want to rub it in here we go here's our faucet assemblies right all right when you're dealing with these widespread faucets there's always multiple parts make sure you consult with the  installation instructions. But for the most part you're going to have something like this you back up the bottom plate. So now you have something nice. And tight. And the handle goes on. And it makes something pretty with an eighth of an inch there. So there's no no rubbage when you're opening. And turning it okay piece of cake. And then we can thread on a washer from underneath they're marked hot. And cold all right. And then we have the faucet line which has got something similar going on right here like that there's no way to connect that. And hold it in place until afterwards yay this is the drain comes with a gasket prep top it's also threaded here okay here is a place i think i forgot to do that on the other video max anything that's threaded should have a joint compound okay. And it can be as simple as something like this been in that box man for months look at that comes out like brand new okay nothing too serious go backwards until it sits in the cradle there off we go to the races okay that's just to make sure that nothing leaks down the road  you can buy different tail pieces that's why comes like that all right s different functions. So whatever is what it is we just drop that in the hole. And everything else we connect from underneath here's the  the the short. And skinny on it okay. So you drop that in. And then from underneath you put this other gasket on this way okay there's a hole in the sink that you want that wedge to fill. And it goes under compression by using a slip ring. And that. And then you tighten it all up okay. Now if you want to watch the whole ping assembly we've got it in the video for how to go from a single to a double sink i suggest you watch it's very detailed. And step by step. But just. So you know plumbing is pretty basic every time you buy a plumbing fixture it comes with instructions all right. And if you like these particular faucets they're very affordable reel pro information in the video description. So you can find out where to get it where you live the good thing is is the faucet part here okay it's a push connect all right. And so the water supply hot. And cold go into the bottom here underneath the sink. And then you just push connect the top in all right it's about as simple a plumbing as you're going to find in the market. And this stuff works phenomenal let's just get it on make sure your handles go in horizontal. So you turn towards you that's why they're marked hot. And cold cuz they operate in the opposite function. So make sure you put the hot on the right side. And there's this lovely little set screws in here for the handles okay this little piece of packaging that looks like garbage keep it don't throw that out all right there we go there's the skinny",https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=1917,"['What is the main benefit of replacing a single vanity with a double sink in a master bath?', 'How did the author remove the foreign obstacle from the drain?', 'What type of connection does the faucet line use?', 'Why is it important to consult installation instructions when working with widespread faucets?', 'What is the purpose of the slip ring used in connecting the gasket under the sink?']"

Now remember i showed you how to draw the lines over here for the other mirror i wanted to just put this one in because  real quick i got weirdly lucky with studs. And framing in the wall this one not. So lucky i missed it by half an inch. And this one there's nothing here okay. So in this case i'm just going to take my philli bit all right i'm going to put it right where the hole is that's it okay i'm going to punch a couple of holes in here i'm going to show you i get these at home depot okay these are actually one of the best wall drywall anchors out there. Now if you haven't seen it we do a video we're kind of making fun of drywall anchors because most of them don't work with their darn all right these actually do you collapse the middle. And you push the points over all right you stick them in that hole. And generally speaking they're bigger than your drill bit take your hammer. And sink them in nice. And flush they have that star grid on the backside it cuts the drywall okay. So they won't twist. So feel free to give them a good shot all right. And then inside the package they have this little red plunger okay. And it's skinny skinny skinny. And then it gets thick. And you want to put that plunger in there. And push it until the thick part goes all the way to the back maybe i'll just show you what happens to it. And what happens is it pushes the back out okay. And then when you put in the screw the screw goes all the way through the back. And then pulls it nice. And tight. And creates this crazy wedge right that is a really good system. And i love it it's harder than you think sometimes there we go all right it takes a lot of force there we go. Now these are robertson imagine that wasn't expecting that to be a canadian product. And then at the same time i shouldn't be surprised that the best plug system that i like is a canadian product all right okay one more quick time i haven't even checked the c. But because it's a robertson screw i'm thinking it's a canadian product i'm going to check to see if this is available on amazon if it is i'll put it in the video description down below not too many robertson screw fixture products available in the states wow the back of this mirror is crazy sharp i almost want to wear gloves touching this thing it's what happens when you purchase stuff actually these weren't even on amazon on my wife went. And bought these at the store there we go okay all right another reason to buy an ala knife right there makes your finger really long piece of cake right ah she's coming,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=2159,"['What type of drywall anchors are recommended by the creator?', 'How do Robertson screws work?', 'Why is it difficult to find Robertson screw fixture products in the US?', 'What happens when you use a Robertson screw with a certain type of mirror?', 'Can Robertson screws be used for framing in walls?']"

So this part of the video is going to be just really  just information based it's not going to be a step-by-step install i don't want to be the guy that makes an installation video for every kind of door on the market in every scenario i'll do that for a whole year right that just it's not helpful. But what we are going to do is we're going to share the the thinking process the design process. So that you order the right door okay remember when you are building a shower your pan has got a certain size. But it gets attached to the framework. And then we add a tile backer board or cement board or water resistant drywall or whatever have you of half an inch. Then we're adding thin set. And tile. So your buildout is almost an inch on each side. So usually if it's a brand new build you'd have a 34 in space on tile on tile. And now i'm 33. And now when i measure this across i actually end up at 32. And 3/4 okay. So when you go to the hardware store. And this is part of the reason why we did this because you can buy all this at home depot they make these insight is the is the  the model all right. And it's called a pivot door which means it has a piece of a hardware where the door is hinge it's swinging on a hinge it's not a slider. And small spaces you got to have a hinge door. And it'll give you two numbers. And this is the range okay the hardware itself has got a bracket that attaches to the glass that you can adjust with a drill. And you can slide the pin over the bracket up to an inch. And a half distance from one to the next. So what you end up doing is when you get this kind of a package you first take the instructions. And you got to read through them all right to make some sense of it cuz every company's a little different in this particular situation one side of the door has got three pieces of aluminum track that can be built out which is really mind-blowing. So let's take a look at this. So here we are obviously this is the piece that the door will close against okay the door itself has a magnetic track on it. And here here's a here's a piece of track that you could use all right because i like to be able to put this is actually the middle piece believe this or not okay ready there we go there's the middle piece this is the piece that actually gets attached to the wall okay. And the fun part here is you would put a silicone adhesive on there. Now they tell you to line this up. And dr drill holes we already know how hard it is to drill a hole around here. But then the second track sits right in it has a little groove here check that out they stacked together kind of like a lego block okay all right. And then the door track would fit inside of it. And you would actually put the screw through both pieces of of trim the holes line up. And then you put the door track inside of this one there we go. And that's how you would get the build out for a really small shower well my shower is a 33. So it would stand to reason that i wouldn't need this much buildout right. But the truth of it is is even when i fully extend the door on the hinge i measured it off in advance this is a little bit more than i need right. But instead of using this piece with that track up against that wall i'm going to cheat. And use this piece up against the wall with the silicone. And then i'm going to come by. And install this track. And here's the cool part i'm going to show you when we do the installation later. But my thinking is this since i have a little bit of mercy here i can make adjustments for level okay. And i can take a point. And i can pre-drill the hole through both pieces of metal. And i have a special cap like a dish with a screw. And then a snap-on chrome cap that i can get. And i can do that from the inside obviously. So it's more decorative. And i can get this lined up perfectly all right i like that flexibility. So that's how i'm going to do it that means i need these two pieces. So this one is going to go on this side this track goes on this side. Now here's where it gets a little weird in all the years that i was working. And we'd have custom glass installers come on site never once that these guys ever drill anything into the tile okay they simply used the structural silicone put painters tape on it. And then came back the next day that's what we're going to do in a lot of cases they would they would use  two-sided tape. And then silicone on the back of the track. And stick it all in place okay. And then they would silicone the outside edge tape it mark it do the whole install. And then let everything set up afterwards blows your mind there's really no need to be pre-drilling holes. And putting penetrations in the wall if you use the right kind of silicone. And tape it in place she's not going anywhere all right that's what i'm going to do what i'm going to do is i'm just going to start this video right after it's all set set up okay. And then we can show you how to assemble the door. And make the adjustments cuz i think that'll be a lot more valuable than watching me put silicone. And tape everywhere. So you're going to have to figure that out for yourself every shower is going to be different. And these kits come these doors they come in these increments okay. So they actually carry like five or six different sizes in the store locally which is really handy. So make sure you measure properly for the finished space if you're going to order a door or something like that you've really got to consider how level is my wall am i going to be building it out am i adding a/ inch thin set or a/ qu inch. And collapsing it. So it's always best to try to order something like this after you're finished the tile don't guess in advance because it's just going to be very frustrating these are actually in stock it was really really,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=2353,"['What is the main purpose of this video?', 'How do pivot doors work?', 'Why is pre-drilling holes not necessary for installation?', 'What type of adhesive should be used for door tracks?', 'How can you ensure a level buildout for a shower door?']"
2740.0,3420.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,How To Install Light Fixtures | Mirror | GFCI,R_24JCwQ-BE,How To Install Light Fixtures | Mirror | GFCI: Install Shower Door,d8cfbd39-c1f0-7148-95a7-689031548864,To be very frustrating these are actually in stock it was really really handy all right. So now it's time for me to install the door. And i read through all the instructions i've got my parts out i understand the process it's not that tricky step by step just follow their advice earlier i mentioned how i was going to install the track for the door. And just ed my structural silicone. And two-sided tape to set it in place i did that. And i came back. And i took a look at it. And i wasn't really happy cuz when i finished reading the instructions i realized there is no top rail this is a frameless door right there's only a frame on the left. And right side there's nothing across the top. So in reality there's nothing to keep the weight of that door from pulling away from the wall over time. So in hindsight i decided to go back. And even with the the the frame installed i was able to go with a 360 bit glass. And tile bit okay to get through the porcelain. And the glaze. And then i used a 3/16th one of these bad boys here it's a masonry drill. And put it in my hammer drill. And it punched the hole in no time. And i was able to set a couple of those screws on each side that's always an option i usually use quarter inch bits. But 316s worked just fine. And then i was able to use the stainless steel screws in the package to fix it all in place i did have framing in the wall set up earlier whenever you're installing anything in the way have a plumbing fixture tub shower always anticipate someone's going to install a door later on. And put framing in the wall. And it'll save your bon okay here we go we'll show you the assembly. And then i'll show you a few key points for when you're setting a door in place cuz this is a safety glass you can tell because it's got a stamp okay safety glass always comes with a stamp to prove that it's safety glass which means that if i use the wrong kind of pressure or put pressure in the wrong place it'll just shatter that's actually happened to me on a job site before something like this only shorter for a neo angle shower i set the corner i lined it up started sliding it back. And the corner of the glass hit a screw head that was protruding just a little bit too far in the track yeah you can't just go to the store. And buy a replacement right i have to call the manufacturer they have to ship it out special it takes weeks it'll drive you crazy. So when you're working with this stuff be really careful to follow all the instructions read it. And then read it again. And and. Then follow it after okay that's all i can say no two system in the world is exactly alike. And there are hundreds of different manufacturers out there making this stuff. So my suggestion is be careful there's a company out there i think it's ov right they make great products. But their glass is 10 mm that's half in their products are incredibly heavy all right we bought one of their shower kits once. And it took four grown men to carry it upstairs it was unbelievably heavy it should be in three boxes not one i don't know what they're thinking. So try to stick to the thinner glass this is like a 38 it's a lot lighter you'd be surprised the difference 40 lbs makes all right okay. Now they suggest to put this on facing away from the magnet all right. And that's the bottom. And that's the top it fits evenly great. So just start with one side here we go. And just a word of warning don't just run your thumb along to push it down it'll get incredibly hot really fast. And you'll be burned before you realize what happened that too i learned the hard way okay that is the inside of over here this is the outside of the glass that's where the decorative part goes here we go get to set that up it's funny because you know you can always use these compression fittings through glass as long as the metal is not in contact with the glass. And you've got these plastic fittings you can put all kinds of pressure on the glass it's really strange in the situations don't be afraid to overtighten if you go too loose it'll just loosen up on you okay to date i have not s been in a situation where i've been able to overtighten this here goes everything. So now i got to get it on my shoe. So i can get my hand underneath it pick it up we're going to set this thing in place. Now it comes with a bracket that goes on the very bottom oh one second there's a little plastic piece that goes in the hole that's the same size yeah. And that's about [applause] here craziest thing i've seen i need to really make an adjustment here i have to adjust this hinge to make this door as wide as possible [music]. Now so that's the widest it'll go we'll bring this into position set it on the bracket yes it's going to be too wide we're going to back it up about a/ an inch okay okay that's perfect. Now i'm in position where i can install this bracket right again we got to put the extra plastic wheel on here we got to shut that down all right i've also got that really in a bad spot had no mercy for the install up there. And then that happens okay try that again this is one of these moments you've just got to say to yourself i'm going to drive myself nuts it's going to be frustrating as hell i'm going to get through it i'm not going to lose my temper not going to lose my temper not going to lose my temper not going to lose my temper okay. Now believe it or not i'm supposed to. Now god get a a little tiny screw screw in place here to hold this bracket petrified of the door coming off okay this ain't going to work. And i'm talking about the guys who made this door what the hell are they thinking there is a little set screw in here. So i'm going to tighten it which creates compression from the hinge. And the outside panel. And i'm going to just tighten that. So that nothing's slipping around anymore. Now i can use both hands okay maybe just maybe my big fat fingers i can get these tiny little pieces together boy oh boy yeah good luck with that i need a longer drill bit i can't get my drill to line up because i'm i need a longer drill bit that's hilarious i need to go get my 6in drill bit. Now be right back times four or 5 in just isn't going to do you got to pull out the big guns just. So you can get the right angle okayo all right right. Now what we want to do is we want to level this off we want to kind of square this up. So that is sitting in the hole properly before we bring in the next track [music] okay good. And it's funny i was more concerned at the very beginning. Then i wasn't going to have enough room my hole was going to be too big. Now i'm loving it okay. So i don't need this anymore that was temporary okay what i want to do is i want to get the the last piece of track all right this track goes inside of this one here's my track. And i have to drill from the back side in three spots to make a hole the right side for my machine screws. So i push it all the way in bring the magnet over snaps out the track exactly where i want it [applause]. Now in this situation as soon as you feel yourself go through that second piece since it's just a hole there's no other glass or anything you're fine stop what you're doing get yourself a set screw line this up okay hopefully this works it's always a terrifying moment because the hard way they bring you is usually really soft alloy. And because that felt a little bit too tight this time i'm going to drill the hole. And i'm going to give it a little bit of wiggle room just to open up a hair more there we go this time i'm feeling a lot more confident i don't want the thread to have to fight that hard getting in that hole perfect one for the [music] bottom okay next thing is a handle eh relatively tight the wash pressure will compress at that point without putting all that pressure into the glass. And that's what's going to keep it from shattering on you just tightening on the handle maybe one of these days we'll buy one we'll just re re it on. And blow the door up for fun max. But that's what it's for okay. So don't have that experience. And go i don't need a washer there goes your door it's 5 cents for the washer probably another $150 for the replacement glass door all right see now worse that looks all right that's an interesting installation,https://youtu.be/R_24JCwQ-BE?t=2740,"['What type of door is being installed in this video?', 'How does the safety glass work in this door?', 'Why is it important to follow the instructions when installing a door?', 'What are some common mistakes people make when installing a door?', 'What is the difference between 10mm and 38mm glass?']"

So it takes the fear out of doing your own electrical bottom line is there's a lot of good reasons to change your light fixtures whether you got a brand new house. And they' put in one of these little darlings for you. And you got to finish the job or you're looking at selling your house experts agree that a paint job. And new light fixtures can modernize just about any space a lot of people won't do it on their own though. And they want to hire an electrician. But in today's shortage of labor good luck finding an electrician who's going to agree to come by your house for an afternoon to change some lights not going to happen if you want it done you got to do it yourself. And that's why we're here. So today we're going to put in pendant lights right here we're going to replace builder grade flying saucers with flush mount modern fixtures i'm going to change this flush mount into a slim mount flush to the ceiling led. And then finally we're going to hang a chandelier center of the table away from the original light fixure just a quick,https://youtu.be/fUMzFeFGVh4?t=0,"['What are some good reasons to change your light fixtures?', 'Can new light fixtures modernize any space?', 'Why is it difficult to find an electrician for a simple task like changing lights?', 'How can you install pendant lights yourself?', 'What type of lighting fixture will be hung center of the table?']"

And a glass of wine. And maybe your elbows. But if you stand on it you could break that thing in half. So we're going to be reaching today when you're taking off your light fixture there's basically one rule almost every light in the entire north american continent is installed screwed to an octagon box in the ceiling show you what that looks like in a second. And to get your light fixture out all you got to do is loosen the screws not much different than a smoke detector rotate off the screws. And pull it straight down okay. Now before we get too much further let's talk about the power here because every light is going to have a white. And a black new houses are usually spray painted. So you got to look up here a little bit to trace them out. But it's the white. And the black. And watch this the black line goes to a brass screw. And the white line goes to a silver screw the way to remember this is b to b black to brass okay. And then you'll be good to go forever. And ever. Now inside the box there might be a mess of wires if your home is older like from 1970s what they did is they ran the power supply to the box they ran a wire back to the switch ran another wire back to the box. And then they might have gone from here to another light. So they could have a ton of wires in here. But if you're replacing a light fixture you want to find this the one white. And the one black that actually goes to the fixture don't worry about the rest of it because they'll all work exactly the same all we're doing is finishing off the power supply. And then the return okay. Now you might think oh let's just unscrew this. And then we'll be good to go because we can save the twisted end. But i'm going to tell you that's a bad idea. And here's why when you are using copper. And it heats. And cools. And heats. And cools. And it. And it will actually expand. And contract it starts to get a little brittle. So the older this is the more likely just pulling it off you're going to break one of these wire connections what i recommend in every situation is take your wire cutters come on over here. And cut right through the sheathing okay pull it out of the way make sure your power is off if you're extremely paranoid you can even turn off the breaker. But if the breakers off all the lights in the room probably won't work. So don't forget new houses today we wire all of the lights on one circuit. And all of the plugs going to different circuit. So if you want any lights in the room at all you probably have to have the breaker on unless you want to get an extension cord in a lamp all right here we go. So this is black believe it or not we can just expose a little bit of that there we go. And if you buy one of these tools are really handy it's a cutter it's a stripper for the wires. And it's square end. So you can twist wires together if you need to basically what we want to do is we want to start fresh all right. So on the side there's going to be numbers wiring. And residential homes in north america is always the same it is always going to be a 14 gauge wire. And that relates to the size of it the bigger the number the biger i'm sorry the smaller the number the bigger the wire it's kind of like golf right a low score is better than a high score okay that's better all right. And then we're going to take an inch of this one. And i'm looking at the third number okay i'm going to warn you all these lights come in boxes with styrofoam packaging open them up in a garage or somewhere else where it's easy to clean if you open them up in your house you'll be sweeping that stuff up for months. So the first thing you want to do once once you got all your components out just get familiar with it understand what it is that they're doing here. Now lots of packaging okay let's get rid of the packaging it's not necessary all that's going to do is confuse you one of the parts of the package is this one right here it's a little baggie it's got some hardware. And it's got instructions we're going to keep that handy every one of these lights is going to have instructions you're going to want to read them most of them are going to say exactly the same thing. But every once in a while they'll do something creative. And surprise you. So you don't want to get comfortable. Now generally speaking because this is a pendant light we're having a two wire okay it's black. And white in here they're interchangeable. So don't worry about it. And there's a ground all right we'll get to that later. And it is completely adjustable it's not like floor cabling for electric heated flooring you can cut this to length. And there is a ton of length all right. So even if you have let's say a 20ft ceiling you could hang this. And the right height which is pretty awesome you'll also notice that there's this porcelain ring in here this cap it's quite common you see this in bathroom lights as well it's actually for mounting the shade all right. So what will happen is that'll get mounted like this eventually. And then you're going to put this metal thing back on. So that you can hold the shade in place mhm. And then you can add your light light bul all right simple enough we have this part here this is the mounting okay this is the part that goes over the octagon box on the ceiling you'll also notice in this particular model this can be adjusted in case you're living with a vated ceiling you can adjust this to go straight down the idea here is the wire is going to get threaded through this hole come out here. And then you can do your wiring. And then slide this up. And then mount your box on the ceiling. And then we've got an assortment of rods all right this is very common to have more than what you need if you are ordering a light for a really large extension make sure you check the manufacturers instructions because they're not going to give you 20 ft of rod they're going to give you 20 ft of wire you can order extra rods if you need it this gives you the option with too long. And too short to come up with whatever combination you need to hang this light at about 6 feet from the floor which is common okay that's an industry standard you don't have to sit there. And guess. And say ask all your friends over what do you think this high this high just set it to 6 fet. And forget it because these rods are going to be designed for an 8 or 9t or 10t ceiling okay. So just to prove our point we need to know the height of our ceiling. And if you're not sure you can always do this stand it on the end roll it up we are 1 in shy of 9 ft we want 6 feet off the ground we want an assembly here that's 3 feet tall let's see what we got with rod 3t is right about there my problem is is that when i add this from depth as well i am going to be a little bit longer than i want to be h all of this together is actually 3t. And 4 in. So maybe instead of this long run rod here we'll put on a short one because that short rod is. So i have a dilemma i'm either 4 in too low or i'm 2 in too high in my world i would rather be 2 in too high than 4 in too low i don't like trying to have a conversation with people with this hanging right [laughter] here. So there's a little bit of wiggle room on this one okay guys you got to make sure you're comfortable. And you're going to be happ in the end. But if you want open concept you lose the open concept if you can't see across the room all right. Now we've got the rod threaded together woohoo we're ready to roll okay the key here is to get all of this through all of this it's a tiny hole right h i know frustrating huh. So here's my secret  we're going to give this a try we're going to measure out the wire that we need for the extension i we're going to give ourselves a healthy piece of wire to work with when we're up there all right. And we're going to cut this sucker that's commitment. And then we're going to take this ground wire straight piece of it without any knots. And we're going to measure that 3 ft again. And a little bit more we're going to thread this through the rod first. And then we're going to tie all everything together. And then pull it all through at once this can be a little bit tricky when you're sticking all three wires at the same time tada. So this is not a very solid wire okay. So we're going to bend over both ends we're going to loop them together all right we're going to basically twist all this together. So that it has a little bit of holding power. But we don't want the diameter of this connection to be too wide all right. And then we're going to take a little bit of our electrical tape. And we're going to just go beneath that joint. And we're going to connect this okay we're going to tape a couple of inches of this together starting from just the copper wire getting this started is tricky once you're started it's easy we're just going to candy cane this thing here we go all right little bit of tape isn't going to hurt we're just. And roll it. And tape it. And roll it. And be done. So far. So good i'm liking it we're right at the end. Now okay. And you can see there's not a lot of room up here there's even a gasket causing some resistance. And that gasket came off that's good okay we're in wo all righty that is great news last thing we want to do here is we want to thread this in okay okay we are. Now ready to mount our light fixture all right let's just get rid of all the extra because you don't need this much wire up there when you're wiring a light okay all right that one's ready the only thing left to do is to take these ends here. And actually split them. So these are two plastic wires capped together get your knife in there separate it once you've got it started you can pull it back as much as you need all right. And you can you can treat either these as black or white they're interchangeable this will be your ground. And now what we got to do is connect the dots up top. So connect the dots up top those two screws that are mounted to the octagon plate they actually going to get installed in in these two slots okay. Now there's a place here it says ground on the plate this is very common you're going to want to have your green screw in here i just want to usually this comes already connected delicate touch there we go all right. And then we're going to use these screws that come in the package to mount this box on the ceiling or you can use the original ones that are up there i like to use the original ones. And then we've got merets we'll put those in our pouch. And then we've got these. Now these are awesome these are the screws that go in this plate. And they're going to be mounted to the ceiling. And they're going to here i'll come over here to this. And they will stick through the top of this. And then there's a brass cap that goes on. And that's how it's all going to hold in okay. So it's really simple. So this gets wired to the box this plate gets screwed to the box. And then this fixture gets tightened to this the trouble we have here is if you use these long places for the screws. And then you go to put your nut on look what happens there's no resistance for it okay. So what you want to do is you want to take your tape. And you want to measure from hole to hole okay. And in this case it is 2. And 3/4. Now these plates come universal. So you're going to find two holes here that are 2. And 3/4 apart. And in this case it's the interior lines just going to okay. So i got three holes the inside lines are 2. And 3/4 apart. So what we do is we take this from the top. And you want to thread this screw through the plate. Now that it's on a thread when you go to tighten this there's a resistance all right. And you can actually mount this thing we're going to start off by going 100% all right. And i'll tell you why in a second let me just finish threading this once you've got this set as deep as it can possibly be when you go to put this on if it's still a little bit loose you can take it off pull the cap down. And you can actually take this with your fingers. And you can actually set the threads a little bit deeper inside the box to get that desired height you want everything snug. And just bugging a rug here. So we'll start with our best scenario. And then we'll go from there all i need is my morrettes my this two of these i'm going to put these somewhere where i won't lose them these wires here are actually thinner than the house wiring. So we're going to line these up at the 16 okay. And we're going to strip them there we go again use your strippers on the 16 mark. And it takes off the outer cap without taking out the carbon fibers turn this into more of a robust wire all right beautiful. Then we're going to want to do this take these out want to take our plate. Now your assembly is ready hold the one screw put your drill on the other screw okay get that set. So nothing is going to fall apart for simplicity you're going to have one wire coming off each side okay there we go let's find the other mounting location try to make sure that there's metal on the drywall on each side when you mount it that'll help make sure everything is nice. And snug if you don't have contact with the drywall you can see there's a space between the plate. And the bracket in that. And you might have to put some sort of like a washer or something else in there to keep it sturdy when you're doing a merette 1 in of extra is a little bit much 3/4 is fine we'll trim that back a bit the reason i cut it 1 inch originally is in case i had to curl it to go on a mounting screw not very common nowadays. But still a possibility this is where the magic is. Now what we're going to do is we're going to lift our fixture we're going to use the ground wire like a temporary hanging mount okay we're going to just go around that ground screw a few times okay that's a permanent wire as well. And take my screwdriver ground screws are always flat headed okay make sure you have one in your toolbox get some good contact in there beautiful. Now we're ready okay. And when i'm wiring i always like to pretend like everything is live in case while you're working somebody walks in the room flicks the switch on you okay. So we'll get rid of the extra ground nothing's going to touch the black. And white are far apart. Now we're going to just start here with the neutral. And i'm going to go this way. So that you can see what i'm doing going to grab my merette i'm going to get the ends of the wire together. And then i'm going to wrap the soft metal around the hard metal all right. Then i'm going to take my cutters. And trim back any extra because i want the soft. And the hard metal to both be right deep in the merette. And then this little tiny orange merette is designed for a 16 gauge. And a 14 gauge wire. And it will twist it together really good no need for tape or any further consideration. Now if we're working like is hot we're going to fold this up we're going to push it into the box all right just repeat with the black wire we're good to go again line them up. And remember even if it's live if you're you're only touching black wires there's no surge of current it's perfectly safe. So if somebody comes in. And turns the light on right. Now i'm okay because i'm dry if i was wet they'd have a current i was standing in a puddle all right. Now here we go we fold it like an s to get it up there okay don't just shove it up fold it like an s nice gentle bends. And now we're ready to start this here's my brass caps i'm going to get rid of this out of the way okay. Now all this extra wire there's more than one way to get rid of it if you just twist your light up it'll generally take care of all of that for you all right here we go. Now we're going to line up cuz we measured in advance right. And this is just a trial run to see if this is going to hold it flush to the ceiling oh that is brilliant that is brilliant there's the other one with no adjustments necessary sometimes if the octagon box is installed flush with the drywall on the bottom these screws will be sticking too low. And you'll have all kinds of wiggling here. And you don't want shadows. And gaps okay. So then you would have to adjust the screw. But in this case it's not flush with the drywall it's kind of halfway through it i can actually get a really nice tight connection there okay all we're going to need is a light bulb we'll show you how this works before we go any further inside of every light fixture there's always a sticker. And it tells you what type of light bulb to use okay great that's good to know out of the gate. But that's not something you want to leave in your fixture long term thr r in adh of that's designed to remove without leaving a mark get rid of it it says maximum 100 watt like as if they sell anything stronger that's a warning you could do without e here we go. Now these bulbs were bought to match the same color temperature as the rest of the lights here this particular client likes the warm light. So it's not the way i go. But that's fine here we go. Now all the pot lights. And the pendants will have the same color temperature very important to keep that in mind okay  just quick warning if you're going to be removing something. And there's a risk of touching the ceiling at all wear latex gloves okay,https://youtu.be/fUMzFeFGVh4?t=55,"['What is the recommended way to remove a light fixture from an octagon box in the ceiling?', 'Why is it not recommended to pull off the twisted end of a wire connection when working with copper wires?', 'How do you identify the white and black lines that connect to the power supply in a light fixture?', 'What happens if you use long screws for mounting the plate on the ceiling?', 'How can you ensure a snug fit between the plate and the octagon box?']"

And flat paint leaves dirt marks not right away. But the dirt in the air will eventually sting in your fingerprints. So you don't want that these flying saucers two of these brackets are fixed one is on a spring. So if you're wondering how to change your light bulb this will work too you pull the spring huh okay. And man sometimes they are really on there okay. And it's a glass fixture god bless them wow that's how you can judge quality oh dude all right. Now we got three bulbs we're replacing it with another three bulb fixture. So these are led light bulbs we're going to just save them. And reuse them they're not dead yet right yeah. Now in these situations you're going to see these fixtures because they're flesh mount. And there's a hole in the ceiling underneath where the octagon is they're going to come with insulation lots of padding okay that's part of the ulc rating for this fixture for protection against fire if you're using incandescent bulbs however we don't use incandescent bulbs anymore. So you don't have to worry about that sort of thing all we have to do is identify the kind of screw that's being used. And all of these are installed the same there's two screws. And it's installed on these really cheap screws okay. Now this is installed in new house construction. So it's partially attached to the ceiling i'm sure yep rotate it. And you find the spot where it'll slide off the head that's just lovely all right. So i have a problem they installed these light fixtures throughout the house before the ceiling paint had cured they didn't wait the 30 days okay. So now when i'm taking this off i have ceiling damage the diameter of this fixture is bigger than the diameter of the next one okay. So i'm going to see little issues like this okay it's going to repair needs some repair. And touch-up paint around every single fixture which pretty much commits you to painting your entire ceiling if you don't want to see the touch-ups all right hey look at this this is different wow this one doesn't have a ceiling bracket it's just wired. And stuffed love it think we're learning something new on every one of these lights this is great okay god thanks builders for putting in the cheapest lights known to mankind if you bought a new house. And you aren't done your oneyear inspection yet try taking off one of your light fixtures. And find out if your builder installed this too soon or not cuz. Then you can take all these off. And say hey you got to fix my ceiling. And then you can get it done for free. So i have the the ceiling mount okay it gets mounted this way i've got to install this bracket first. So that these holes will poke through these holes all right piece of cake not a big deal right. And then there is a lens that screws on with another lens over top of it you'll see in a minute first thing we want to do is get these bloody stickers off all right. So i'm taking out my mounting screws this is pointing down they're going to go in these long slots pointing up we'll just do one at a time here get everything in position i'm not crazy about this cuz they're phillips. And they tend to strip. But oh i'm going go nice. And slow okay gloves all cut up in this trying not to touch the ceiling. And working with gloves on this is awesome this is why i don't use gloves hardly ever okay teachable moment all right  in this case the bracket isn't long enough to get to the other side of the drywall okay. So here's what we're going to do because these screws are longer than i need i am going to just take my screwdriver. And get rid of a little extra dry wheel here that is not necessary that way the entire bracket can sit inside there nice. And flush we'll start with that. And these screws are bigger than the hole god i would love to know the electrician that put this in okay that's done getting my mind blown here you know the octagon boxes come with screws you don't this why i like to use them because they're short the ones that he put in are really [music] [applause] [music] long done that is how you screw a box mount with a screw that's not too deep for the box almost all of these are 8 32s. So there's a lot of options out there. But hey doesn't mean i mean if if you're an apprentice electrician. And you're trying to mount fixtures with a 2-in screw do yourself a favor grab your cutters put the screw in depending on the size of the of the thread screw it in there all right get it right in there. And then cut the screw down okay there you go make the screw shorter that's all you got to do don't be putting them in long all right. And if you're an electrician. And you have an apprentice god's sake teach them a couple of tricks before they get started will you ohay all right let's connect our ground wire boom that's done. Now the ground is done okay. So people wonder sometimes about ground wires right what do i do with them well this wire is wrapped around a screw that's made of steel screwed into a box that's made of steel. And then it's attached to this bracket with a steel screw that's made of steel. And so this wire. Now has no value it's in the way the ground wire goes all the way through the house right down to the panel. And then there's a wire that goes from the panel outside. And that wire is attached to a big steel plate it's about a foot deep. And about 8 in wide they dig a hole. And they pound that plate into the ground the ground wire get it. And so anytime there's a short it's attached to the ground to keep things from blowing up all we need to do. Now is take our two leads black. And white all right. And you see that the black was on one. And the white was on the other this is might have been a good time to keep that marked fortunately for me i run around with electrical tape. So quickly going to put a black stripe on that wire that had that little black end on it okay. Now i won't forget what's what just in case this light fixture requires black to black  same scenario here we got a big sheathing. But we've only got like a 16 wire. So we're going to get ourselves a little bit more more length to work with here okay all right get ourselves a nice long piece of wire to work with. And then we'll do the same with the white let's get the 16 on there okay. Now before we start looking for the screws. And mounting. And all that let's do this let's get our ground wire on here just like before we're going to get it up wrap it around there a couple of times we're going to use our screwdriver to sync that in. Now i don't want anybody being too freaked out with the damage on the ceiling because the diameter of the actual lens on this light is much bigger than this can here all right. Now we're going to go white to white which is right here. And we're going to wrap that throw a mered on it if you're dealing with a light fixture that has a solid copper wire that'll be very rare first of all okay. But if you are these orange morrettes are going to be too small for that you can't stick two solid copper wires together with an orange meret i don't recommend it i like the blue ones the big ones with have little wings on them they make it easier to twist together all these ones come in the package. And they'll work you don't have to second guess all right. Now we're good. Now we've got these two slots we got to line on these two screws. And we got these two nuts boom we're going to stick this together first let's get our wires back up into the box okay. So that we're not going to run into trouble accidentally disconnecting anything all right. Now we can't see all we can do is feel here we go as long as we can get that sort of in the middle hopefully the diameter of our lens will cover all of this up okay right in the middle of these slots there we go. Now we're going with led bulbs we don't really care about the insulation not any sense to tear tear it out of there either though eh this particular light is a little different it's unique there are screws okay these are set screws. And you want to back them up put your finger on the inside slowly until they feel flush with that metal there's only another half turn left when you do that. So be real careful these are set screws yeah i told you be real careful. Now i got to find that sucker okay that was a teachable moment. And whenever you drop a screw stop what you're doing. And watch it that screw fell it bounced over here we found it 12t away on the other side of the room that's the way these things work they're three-sided structures right. So they just fire away okay. Now we need light bulbs that were here before they're only a year old. And they're led bulbs we have a good expectation this will last a few more years. And dar things aren't cheap. So use them up here we go you're not supposed to climb ladders without using your hands. But here we are we have the lens. And a lens cover they go together fancy light right here's the deal  this lens has got slots on it. And grooves for tightening up. So what we do believe this or not ah we are going to install this. And then rotate it until it's caught. And snug all right. And then we're going to tighten up those screws for that we're going to need a bit extender which is not magnetic all right go reach in. And find those screws okay. And all three [music] sides maybe the best plan here is to use a screwdriver definitely thinking screwdriver i'm going to suggest using a screwdriver here's the deal you're tightening that screw to make contact with the glass lens. And using mechanical tighteners in those situations it's not the best idea this thing just sits in place all right let's not freak out. But let's use a wet rag to wipe off any dust you don't want your oil from your hands all over it let's give it a shot. And see what we think hey all right okay same thing got to,https://youtu.be/fUMzFeFGVh4?t=1221,"['What type of screws are used for ceiling mount fixtures?', 'How do you identify the type of screw being used in a fixture?', 'Why is it important to wait 30 days before removing ceiling paint?', 'What happens when incandescent bulbs are not used in ceiling fixtures?', 'Can you reuse LED light bulbs in different fixtures?']"

And then it's connected to another line going to the next light. And then the wire from the light goes into the same merette this is good we're going to learn something new here undo the merette. And if it's done right the other two wires originally are twisted together. And then the ends are cut off. So that is a unit that is a unit still the same thing we're going to connect black to white. And ground nice. And simple we're going to save these morrettes because these are a perfect size for two 14 gauge wires plus what we have here okay the only thing we have to do is we have to undo these screws. And mount this plate again measure the screws 3. And 1/2 it's the outside screw holes here that's simple enough let's get going to that i am confident that the power is off. But because there's always a risk of somebody coming in the room if you cap the two black wires nothing can short okay. So we're going to be good the way that this light fixture works is rather unique. So it' be fun to show you we're going to take our plate it goes on like a top hat this flange goes inside okay. So let's get our first screw set in order to do this we have to get over all of our wires okay definitely not an environment to be working in if the power is on. And you don't have the meret covered that could be shocking results sorry that was a bad d all right. Now we're simply putting this plate flush to the ceiling on both sides why is that seam. So loose that's the same freaking builder that put in screws longer whoever mounted the lights in this house took out all of the short box mount screws. And put in the screws from the light fixture which are too long for our boxes that is maddening oh god we're going to have to connect ground ground to ground all of these are 16 gauge cut them all back. Now because it's a ground with one i have to grab the merett that came with the package we're going to do this one first copper wire even though it's covered in paint there's enough copper exposed there i'm not going to worry about it we're going to just wrap those two together because there's no ground screw on that plate because it's going to sit flush we're going to do that we're going to bend that up. And out of the way put that inside the box okay we're going to take the whites. And we're going to put that yellow one there here we are wait to wait i know sometimes when you watch a video like this you're like really is the wiring that simple yeah. But this isn't wiring this is just attaching the fixture. So this isn't like wiring a house there's really not that much complications going on here. And we'll twist that on oh before we go any further max can you hit the light switch yay it worked okay thank you it's good to have a camera guy handy eh love my videographer we want to push all of this in. And out of the way to make room for this monstrosity. So you got to be really considerate here about what's going where god help us all eh. Now that's it done. So now you can hang an led flesh mount to the ceiling anywhere in your house in any box you just really want to make sure you have those short screws. So you can keep everything nice. And tight i'm going to fix that another day. But i wanted to get that demonstration done. So now when it's time to change that i can just grab this. And give it a yank i'm going to change these two mount screws. And then i will put all this back together. But for today that's how it's done cheers all,https://youtu.be/fUMzFeFGVh4?t=1954,"['What type of wires are typically used in LED fixtures?', 'Why is the ground wire important in electrical connections?', 'How do you ensure a safe connection when working with live wires?', 'What is the purpose of twisting wires together before cutting them?', 'Why is it necessary to use screws that fit snugly into the box?']"

But for today that's how it's done cheers all right the next type of light is again another pendant light. But it's got a unique twist it's going to be acting as a chandelier. And so the basic concept is we want to get this center of the table in the room. Now the light location octagon box has got nothing to do with the s room it's way over here. So what i've done is this particular light fixture comes with rods multiple lengths you want to have this 36 to 40 in above the table that's fine we can make that adjustment we just have to take off this extra 6 in. And then we have chain that they supply great that chain's useless it's way too short. But it does have the unique function functions where i can replace the end with a thread or just with the female thread. So that i can attach it to the rod the goal here is to go rod off the light install one of these little hooks in the ceiling hang this on the hook. And then run this chain 3 ft over to another location where we would. Then have this fixture mounted on the ceiling piece of cake let's go through all the steps first thing i had to do is go. And buy a bigger chain it's  very similar in style it isn't perfect. But it's. So close we're going to run with it remember the weight of the fixture is going to be hanging on this. So the chain is just aesthetics try to get as close as we can we want to. Now salvage these units off of this chain we need a couple of pliers okay we're just going to take our pliers every chain has got a broken link. And you can open them up. And take things off there we go. And we're going to want to have this end as well we'll just grab each end of the link boom we've got both ends we don't need this let's rescue this here again we have to take a look at the instructions understand the assembly it's rather straightforward in this scenario we're going to take all of these washers out one two. And then three save the cap for later remove the extra rod don't be too much of a hurry here in case anything is knotted up you don't want to tear it apart okay here we go that's not necessary anymore in this particular light we're going to have a round plate to go up instead of a bar still has a green light still going to need to be attached with the existing screws for the octagon box. And it has screws with those brass covers on it again. So we're going to want to find the location to thread through here. So let's do that first we'll get this established before we lose these little pieces. So what we do is measure hole to hole. And in this case we're 2. And 3/4 again very nice one of the things this fixture has the other one didn't is it has nuts okay. So you can actually use these nuts in the following manner holes that are 2. And 3/4 these are two the next option are 2. And 3/4 we're going to go with these holes we're going to go from the top side of the plate going [music] down should have grabbed a drill max. Now here we go. Now in this scenario we have these screws are really long we're going to assume that's flat on the ceiling okay. And if that is the case. And it's flat. And i put on these caps you see that it'll be sticking out all right it won't be tight to the ceiling what we do instead is we back the screw off okay a little bit. Then we add a nut to the underside. So that when you're screwing in the clockwise direction you're not making the head of that screw turn any further it won't keep on going inside the the light fixture that'll give us the ability to get a really nice tight fit we'll set the other one as well. And of course this can be adjusted when the plates off if you find it's not long enough you can drop it move the nuts. And you can make adjustments while you're sitting there on the ladder. So that's not going to be a concern okay that's set up we'll put these on here just for. Now so we don't lose them that'll keep them handy we're ready to mount that we're ready to mount that we have our wire already through the rod i think we're okay to go ahead. And tighten the rods together in this particular case the client watchs the rod all the way to the ceiling. And then the chain to go from the hook all right there's that at least in this situation the wire is already fished that's very nice. And if you have any trouble putting these things together these these machine threads stick it on go backwards until you hear that you hear that okay one more time backwards downward pressure there you go. Now you know it's sat in the thread. And then you can go forward if you're not sure you can cross thread these things remember the metals that they're using here they're cute. And they're adorable. But they're soft metal. And you can cross thread something really quickly if you're not careful all right that's ready that's going to be plenty ready in this scenario though we are going to wait until we get this mounted before we adjust the wire all right last thing we want to do here is get this little cap through the wire this is the fitting that's going to same machine thread we'll thread onto here. And we'll hang on my ceiling hook. So we want to get these wires in here put this in play before we start getting on a ladder. And carrying things above our head. And this okay lift it up. And spin the fixture that's a much easier way to tighten this on that way you won't mark the fixture or your table okay we're good. Now now that we have that established let's move on to where our center line is going to be what i got here is my fire core laser this one drops lines in multiple directions. And i'm going to get two lines. Now okay. So i'm going to get one line want to put it right across the middle of the table beautiful. And then i'm going to measure the length of the table to find my middle. Now 92 1/2 which means 41. And 1/4 is the middle we want to slide this down to 41. And 1/4 we also made sure that we've got this symmetrical with the existing light fixture. So we've adjusted the table to be in the middle of the existing light that provides a little bit of symmetry just because when people walk through this door. And come into the room they're going to want to see these two fixtures in you know similar position instead of coming across the room. But don't worry about it at the end of the day if you have to come across the room you got to do what you got to do have the light in the right spot is more important than the symmetry i'm going to grab my ladder pull out my marker. And put one little dot where the intersection is. And then we'll go to work mounting our fixture okay there we go. Now that we have that we need to know one some one thing am i going to be mounting this into wood or is it drywall that's the biggest question i have here. So i'm i'm going to use my stud finder to find out that is disconcerning you'd think i would find something in the ceiling okay in the absence of the presence of any wood the question is how is the ceiling attached this is freaking me out okay. So if it's not strapped that way it's strapped this way oh there we go there we go there it is okay. So we are a couple inches away from the strapping or stud or whatever the joist whatever it is i don't care i'm fine. Now at least i know how i'm going to mount this let's turn off our laser before we go blind yes you should wear protective glasses when using lasers or you will wear the other kinds of glasses like i do. Now here's my decorative hook ah different sizes different shapes they come in the package with two options okay. So you can machine thread into this. And then thick thread goes into wood we don't have wood. So we are going to use all machine thread always go backwards to find your thread. And here we go this is a special type of drywall hook it collapses goes through the hole spring loads. And then carries weight halfin drywall with this kind of toggle bolt is rated for over 80 lb this is a 3/16 if you're wondering you can google the double check. But the point is that's maybe 20 we're going to be just fine if you have to hang a major chandelier. And you're going to have like metal. And beads. And glass. And multiple lights check the load rating make sure you buy a fixture rated for it in most cases you can't just mount those to drywall in those cases you're going to need an octago box attached to the framing. And just as a side note if you're putting in a fan light it's the same kind of deal you have to have wood going from joist to joist as blocking. And then the octagon box gets mounted underneath the blocking you can't just take an octagon box into the side with two screws. And hang a fan it's guaranteed to come down. And kill somebody just as an added bonus i'm going to grab the base of this give it a good twist. And make sure it's really set into those threads okay. Now i'm good. Now i also have to make a big enough hole for about a half an inch what do i got this half an inch yeah that'll work all right let's go make a hole. And put our hook in we have our little red black dot here all right i'm it's going to go like this all right till i feel like it's about a half an inch pinch these ends together. And then just finish their job with this here there we go there we go done with downward pressure we're going to just go clockwise. And that'll end up going in position this only takes about 3 minutes okay almost there almost there come on baby ah all right you want it nice. And snug okay. Now we can hang the fixture holy cow off the tip. And all right that's step one we're going to just take this apart. Now just like the first light fixture in this situation because it's his round thing we're using the outer circle that's the diameter for the screws. And again we want to just balance it over the hole. And whoa got to love those bits hey not too much you want the wires coming through the middle okay. Now we're here separate them identify it this one's black there's still enough of that wire showing that's not a problem all right i already know we're going to be going with morrettes. So this time i'll just strip it down to about a half an inch we're going to be coming across with a chain. But that will look stupid we want something a little bit more relaxed comea plus room to wire okay. So now we're going to get rid of all of the excess lord knows we don't need that. And just to get started we're going to grab a very similar length of chain hang the chain off that fixture. And thread it i think that looks sloppy i would rather go right there. And thread it okay once you're done take the two sides just simply pinch them back together all right wonderful thing about brass it's rather soft you can make it look like just about anything you need it to okay here we go. Now we go through the process going in. And out of this chain threading both wires at the same time okay you can do it any way you like i like to go every two rungs all right otherwise it just gets really knotted up in my [music] experience as long as you're consistent it'll look very intentional. Now that i've got them both at the same point i'm going to go like that. And i'm like i like that look i'm going to start with that double check check with the homeowner after i get it connected i can always lose a link or two. And tighten it up a little more if i need to let's get rid of the extra chain i felt that okay. So now i'm taking the other end of that initial chain we're putting it together this is hollow the wires will fish through this we just have a washer. And then a lock nut. And then a regular nut just to be sure we'll put wrench on that give it a twist okay. Now we're good to go let's go like this right boom piece of cake right. And then we're going to close this up. Now using the pliers try to shape that back together a little bit. And we can we can work all this out to more perfection after it's all finished really the goal here. Now is to get these wires push through the middle here we go that was nice. And easy we want to have the wire. And the cable both stretch the same degree. And just like the last the first sorry just like the first light we want to separate those two wires this can be dangerous. So use a little bit of care okay mission accomplished right there all right first thing of course just like the the first light we did is we'll get that ground wire on let's wrap it three times pinch them together we'll get our screwdriver in here being conscious of where the exposed black. And white are you don't want them touching anything in case someone walks in the room if you've got your breaker on still okay. And you want to strip a little bit over an inch twist the thread. And then wrap it on. And just like the first time i still need to cut a little bit of that tip off not a problem make sure you pinch the wires way back. So that the moret has room to to cover even the the casing okay there you go. And if it's a lot of work you know you got a good connection same thing here we go number 16 we go a little bit more than an inch this time twist the wire being conscious of that ground get the casings to the same point. And then we'll wrap it here we go snip the excess toss on a merett that's like gordon ramsey eh snip moret on wire inserted caps removed. Now we want to get that right back up to that nut take off these caps. Now you're going to have to hold that nut in place okay we'll give this our first shot this is our m maiden voyage here see if we have our our depth good i think i like it okay all right. And there's only one thing left to do other than the light bulb or light bulbs i'm not sure how many light bulbs this get probably a three you want to just put a little bit of tension on your chain okay. And then push your extra wire up until the chain starts to look a little bit sloppy. And put a little tension get it all hanging nice okay here we go. Now we take the time to readjust our closing because this these little details here they matter okay want to get this as close to perfect as we can there we go nice look any machine thread just go backwards until you feel it click. And off we go let's try that out boom i like that you can still get any heated argument at the dinner table playing poker or something. And get up. And talk to somebody without banging your head all right you know the funny thing is is i'm one of these last few guys around that got into the golden black looks like it's going to be here for her for a while i'm kind of liking it i don't know it's growing on me slow to change see i'm old what do you want listen if this kind of helps. And you're interested most of these were  led light bulbs. And one of them was a led fixture if you're interested in checking other light fixtures at our led we've got another video for that you can click the link over here we'll see you in another video soon cheers,https://youtu.be/fUMzFeFGVh4?t=2206,"['What type of chain is used to hang pendant lights?', 'How do you attach a pendant light to a ceiling?', 'What is the purpose of a stud finder in hanging fixtures?', 'Why is it important to use the correct size of hole for a decorative hook?', 'How do you properly connect and secure wires to a pendant light fixture?']"

So all of that's coming soon. But before we talk about where you should shop for them i'm going to show the demonstration for the installation. Now this is crucial the largest mistake people make when they're installing their pot lights is the way that they cut the hole in their ceiling remember you don't want to be drilling a hole until all of your finished paint is completely done all right this is the last step before you put your flooring in what you want to do is get a drill one of these little drill bits here okay you want to go to the store. Now i love the milwaukee hole saw bits what we're gonna do is we're going to measure the diameter on the back of this light from this edge to this edge not the hole finish trim just the part that goes inside the drywall in this case that's exactly 400 quarter inches. So i wonder if i bought a four. And a quarter drill bit. Now they come in 1/8 inch increments. So it doesn't matter what manufacturer you buy you can get a hole saw that fits perfectly if you use a hole saw that's not the right size you're gonna be fussing around with a knife to try to make the hole bigger or you go hole would be too big. And you can see that there's not a whole lot of mercy here that's not a lot of overlap room right. So if your hole is just a little bit too big you run the risk of always having a gap showing. And then you're patching holes making a messier sealer do yourself a favor get one of these bits throw it in your drill put your drill in low speed okay this is not a race generally speaking there's three mistakes people make they try to drill too fast because they're in a hurry they drill in the wrong direction right. And then they're pushing too hard this situation you want to let the drill bit do all the work i know this is going to be interesting. But there are actually holes here that you can look up through. And you can find the mark on the ceiling that you may. And you can just start your drilling process. But here's the trick put it on reverse the teeth are all sharp. And pointing this way. And if you start drilling that. And you aren't perfectly parallel to the ceiling like you have a bit of an angle the first tooth will grab. And then your saw blades gonna run all over the place you're gonna destroy your ceiling. So you can put it on reverse set your blade your pilot bit which is longer than the teeth put that in the drywall go real slow. Now most of these drills come with a trigger finger kind of reaction the harder you squeeze the faster goes. But you can go nice. And gentle a little bit of a squeeze okay here we go. And we're creating a hole for the pilot bit first. Now we've got contact we're still in reverse. So what we want to do. Now is we want to scratch up the drywall going backwards because it's just paper right just backwards. And you'll make a perfect perfect scratch no here we go i'm going to show you. Now i'm a little bit off-center here i actually going deeper on one side than the other. But because i'm going backwards my jump my drill isn't running all over the room. Now there's two things you can do. Now you can go into rip forward. And you can drill through it's nice. And quick. But what i suggest especially if you're homeowner. And you're new at this you're going to have wiring because we run the wire in advance you may or may not have everything where you want it your wires might be sitting right above the hole. And you're worried about damage if you drill in reverse okay like when you run your finger across the teeth backwards it doesn't cut you. So if you drill in reverse. And you make contact with the wire passively it's not going to wreck your wire all right. And this is the system for going when soon as you feel a release just let go there we go that's a perfect hole you don't have broken edges right. So that when you install the light later it's gonna have positive contact with those spring-loaded feet. And we just go like this upside down. And that's how you clean out your drill it's a dirty messy job you might want to wear something the glasses if you're concerned about it. But that's the basic idea for how to drill a hole. Now we're gonna get into a lot more information about pile lights right. Now but where you can buy them what kind to get all the different color variations in the light. And how you want to match that up with the rest of your room. And also how to map it. And plan it. So let's get into the business of how to set up. And have a perfect light installation.

And have a perfect light installation. So if you're new to this kind of installation i'm going to give you a little bit of advice here. And that is take a scrap piece of drywall take the new bit drill your hole okay yeah we are know once you open your package because you obviously have your light at this point because you've measured it out. And i want you to practice installing this. And make sure that the hole is working for you get these spring-loaded clips in the hall okay. And now push it around all four different sides. And you should not see the hole exposed okay that is key there we go. So we know that that's going to be a good installation. Now let's talk about the quality of these lights where you can buy them the different products that are on the market. And then we're gonna do the actual installation where we're going to wire up. And power up. And snap the box into place.

And power up. And snap the box into place. So before we go into the installation i want to talk about where do you find these things because there are a lot of different products on the market. Now i'm installing this product this time around if you are used to our channel you've seen me use different ones before. And i used a product before that the cable that came from this box went directly into this right. And they were faced. And that installation process you had to do all your wiring after you drilled your holes after your installation was done. And that's an option it doesn't really make too much of a difference. But this product here it has a low voltage harness on it okay. And this harness it lines up there's a little hole. And then you can screw them together right. And it works lovely. And now it operates just like the other ones did okay the difference is this one if you want to if you're in an environment where that's beneficial okay you can do all the wiring. And have this left in the ceiling it's an option sometimes that's a really good option. And sometimes it's not i prefer to wire after simply because a lot of things can happen in during the renovation plans can change ideas can change locations can change. And if someone changes a light location even just a couple of inches it can be you know a make-it-or-break-it moment there because if this is all wired in advance perhaps i can't get this short feed over to where i want the new light to be. But i always wire with plenty of extra wire in the ceiling. So if there is a change i can move it almost one or two feet any direction i want. So i like to do it afterwards. Now the lights themselves all right we did a video on a live stream not too long ago we talked about where you can shop. And get a great deal. So these lights just out of curiosity i went down to home depot to take a look at what they had. So the home depot they have this little package of lights here it's a 12 pack of lights great idea all right it's like a project pack for homeowners if you're doing a basement renovation or something like that it's nice to buy in bulk. And so what home depot does is they show you. So each light at home depot if you bought one of them it's $25. Now if you buy their pack of 12 they're going to give you a huge discount they're gonna give you $100 off amazing in it 200 for 12 first glance that looks like the deal of a lifetime doesn't it. But here's the thing there is a company in china that manufactures these lights. And they make eight billion of these every five minutes let's just be honest they're making these lights for probably 40 to 50 maybe 100 or 200 different companies. And the only thing that they do different is they put the packaging for each person who's purchasing lights from them at a certain volume they make unique packaging for them because the product itself has already been tested it's already approved proof for wet areas even. But what they do is they they change the name on that part of the sticker. And they put it in a different box there are hundreds of people selling these lights all over the world. And they're all coming from one point what you need to know is they're not worth twenty-five dollars apiece they're not worth twelve low lights for two hundred i bought them at your gonna one of my favorite suppliers. And they sell mostly flooring. But because they're a wholesaler they thought that would be a kind of a nice idea if they got into the lighting business. And so i actually bought these. Now these are superior quality these are better than a lot of the products around the market because a lot of them products on the market come with really cheaply made springs same factory they come with no rubber gasket for what areas same factory. But these ones here i picked up for 11. And a half dollars of light not 25 11. And a half times 12 well it's 145 bucks my lights were still $50 cheaper for a 12-pack. Then they were at home depot after that amazing deal. And i'm not even ordering them by bulk from china direct. So what i'm trying to tell you is just because you're in a store. And you think you're getting a great deal think twice because this kind of light on just for the record this one here is a much higher quality of the one from home depot they're using the really weak springs. And the lights seem to sag off the drywall a lot not a big fan. But the point is this there's one factory making lights they make two or three different variations of quality. And if you want the high quality light you need to go to the right location find one with that heavy-duty spring okay that'll hold will find one that has this gasket on it there's no gasket. And you put it in your bathroom all that warm moist air is racing up into your attic trust me. And then if you like it you can get one with these connectors it's a good little gig right this is kind of easy to work with because. Then when you're wiring your light you don't have to wire with the whole assembly dangling it's just the one little box. And then you connect them afterwards. So with all that being said that's the backstory on the industry. And where these lights come from it's not a real big secret most things that are manufactured in bulk are manufactured in china out of one plant sold to a myriad of people who are all marketing them differently for different prices. But in a lot of cases it's just the same product. So you'll see this with lights you'll see this with bathroom fixtures. And plumbing fixtures you can buy something for 50 dollars or 150 dollars made from the same plant with a different sticker you've really got a beteen to know where you're getting good value all right. Now let's get into the installation,https://youtu.be/WOK_EH5YHjM?t=343,"['What are some common products on the market that require wiring before installation?', 'How does the low voltage harness in this product differ from previous installations?', 'Why do you prefer to wire lights after installation instead of having them wired in advance?', 'Where can homeowners find a great deal on lighting products like these?', 'What is the difference between high-quality and low-quality lighting products manufactured by the same factory?']"
678.0,982.0,Lighting,PL34cQkzKfXWbu2GFtCM2ghEs4QAi-O59d,How To Install Pot Lights in Kitchen Ceiling,WOK_EH5YHjM,How To Install Pot Lights in Kitchen Ceiling: Wiring,40bfc9c5-5682-850f-25e0-c0cd2d04ac2b,Value all right. Now let's get into the installation. So no wiring pot lights is relatively simple right wires gonna go in the box. And there's half of this boxes where the connections are made. So you don't have to strip too much wire right. But you do want to have enough of the sheathing that goes into the connector that goes into the box. So make sure to strip a couple of inches off of each of these things. Then you're gonna be in good shape if you strip too much. Then you're going to be cutting everything back. And then that's just gonna be a problem oh we got that we're gonna pull out our handy dandy wire cutters here. And we're gonna take off one inch. And supposed to be there we go. Now these snips of course have got the gauge on there that's the same as the wire this is a 14 - which is a 14 gauge. So you put it in the 14 slot it'll cut the sheathing without cutting through the wire go to corner twist. And pop that off. Now we're in business you know you got a good pot light. And you can snap the door up when you don't have a set screw you snap it shut i love this this is. So much easier than having to be up here with a drill you still have this little punch out hole okay this one's easy it only has connection on one side instead of two. So you don't have to hammer through. And brick the box. And rip it apart gotta love that of course you're gonna need a cable connector because they sell these in little packages of five or you can buy a tub of like 100 they're not expensive. So just get what you need. And you just pop this in try to be sure i'm going to show this on purpose the cable connector comes with a like a missing spot here. So you can pinch it together. And put it in the hole. And then it expands in the hole sits in this group. So it stays fixed there's a piece of sharp metal right here okay that's where the the breakout was for that connector resist the don't let your cable connector go in. And leave that metal exposed because that's where your wires going to be going. So anything that's got wire running through it vibrates. So put it in a install it on the opposite side on purpose okay. So there's the where the make sure we put the solid part of the cable connector there that's just good practice that'll help reduce your risk of having any kind of an issue over time. Now we take both of our wires i like to line them up. And push them together at the same time all right here we go yeah. Now you can push through. And there's a little little wedge in there that it gets caught if you try to pull it out all right. So this is actually fixed in place let's just go pull all the blacks together we'll pull the grounds together. And the whites together we'll separate all this for the camera. And the green wire gets connected to those. Now you notice this is a quick-connect system it's amazing all you do is push the wire into the hole all right let's make sure yeah there we go. Now that's in there we go that one's done do - - do you know what i'm gonna do the bitin yeah. Now there are wow it's really tough to do this on camera i think we're going to do something to use my pliers okay i'm gonna hold the wire still right that way i can push this on. And get a good kind of contact you know watch that's set in place. And you got it you can push it right in that's why the depth that you strip these wires out is. So important because you're actually gonna put it in you can see that on camera okay the copper goes all the way to the end okay that one's done that one's done just the black one there's not a lot of room in these boxes. So if it's at all possible to set up your wire configuration we were only dealing with two wires that's great always what i do when i'm wiring my ceiling is i use one roll of wire. And i'll loop it around. And i keep all of these connections the same wire it's just lute. And then when i'm ready to install my where i'll cut the loop in half that gives a lot of flexibility. So if again again i said if there's a position change or something you can steal some of the length from one of the holes. And pull it through to the next hole. And allows you to move a location. And also gives you the flexibility if you make a mistake when you're cutting or trimming you can trim it back. And you always have lots of wire to play with. Now now that we've got all these connections made we're just gonna tuck all this in the box in such a way that the lid will close all right snap that's good piece of cake right. Now the only thing,https://youtu.be/WOK_EH5YHjM?t=678,"['What type of wires are used for pot lights?', 'How much wire should be stripped before connecting to a pot light?', 'What is the purpose of the gauge on wire cutters?', 'Why is it important to leave the metal part of the cable connector exposed?', ""What happens if you don't follow proper wire configuration when installing ceiling fixtures?""]"

Now i'm going to tell you about this because this is really important anybody who's been at this business for a while knows that when you paint a ceiling. And you use a beautiful brand-new flat paint if you touch that ceiling with your hair or your hands oils that naturally exist in your hair in hands is going to get on that ceiling. And in a couple of weeks maybe three or four weeks you know you've finished your projects all done everything is lovely a little bit of dirt that's going in the air is going to cling on to that you're gonna see your fingerprints. And little head marks do not touch your flat ceiling with anything all right where are your nitrile gloves. Now that box just installs there put it in a nice little comfy spot fish your wire up. Now here's the secret rest your first pin just light it up. And put the second pin up okay. And then you can get it into place all right. Now this is actually sitting a little bit off the drywall. And the reason for that if you're taking it out be careful you don't want to just let it come snap down. And rip the drywall this gasket is a lovely thing to have in bathrooms. But everywhere else get rid of it. And that'll make sure your light fits nice. And snug. Now look at a good solid spring snaps it right into place okay the cheap lights you put in there. And this is gonna sit a little you're tapping them. And trying to spin them. And find that happy spot it drives you nuts get a good one. And then no matter where i put this light there's no hall showing all things done if you buy the right,https://youtu.be/WOK_EH5YHjM?t=1026,"['What type of gloves are recommended for painting ceilings?', 'Why is it important not to touch ceilings with hands or hair while painting?', 'What happens when oils from skin come into contact with flat paint on a ceiling?', 'How do you properly install a light fixture in drywall?', 'What is the purpose of a gasket in lighting fixtures?']"

And today i'm going to show you how to use a two-part spray foam insulation package there's a lot of different manufacturers of these packages. So just depend of what's available in your area even though i'm going to show you how to use this particular one make sure you for sure read all the safety instructions. And the user manual in whatever package you get just to be sure that in case there's any differences from manufacturer to manufacturer. So the one we have today is a what they call a two hundred kit. So what they're saying is that the yield on it will be about two hundred square feet worth of foam at one inch thick. So we're gonna be spraying close to two inches thick here. So we'll be hopefully getting around 100 square feet out of these two cans at two inches thick. So once i opened up the box some of the first things you find is you're gonna find the instruction manual as well as the the you know safety equipment that's needed. And all of little tips. And that sort of thing. So make sure you read that over well most of these guys have 1-800 numbers. And websites as well. So if you have other questions you can get ahold of somebody to ask you should find an assortment of some different spray nozzles these guys send two different types. And they they've sent about i don't know four or five of each one it looks like. So this particular nozzle here is just for spraying you know gaps. And cracks sort of thing it's gonna send out a stream. So that would be that one here this one here is a fan tip it's got a bit of a v-notch cut in the end. So this one's gonna spray out about a i don't know it just depends on the kit you're using. But probably eight inch or. So fan width of pattern which is good for filling wall cavities like what we're gonna do here. So you'll have a bit of a selection of the of the tips in there this kit comes with two two containers two two steel cylinders this particular one already has the hoses. And the gun already hooked to it that does have a bit of a carrying handle here as well some of the bigger kits they're gonna have tanks to teach in tanks obviously because it's two components. But the tanks are much larger. So they come boxed separately just because they're too heavy to to carry is one unit. So in here like i said this one the the gun. And the hoses are already attached to the tanks some of them you will it will come with a wrench. And you may have to attach your own hoses. And gun a couple things to go over i guess since i've got the gun out putting on the tips the gun has a bit of a safety trigger here this one. So the yellow button down here has to be compressed or pressed before you can actually squeeze the trigger the tanks are still turned off by the way. So you don't want to turn them on until you're actually ready to spray. So this gun has a safety on it to attach a nozzle,https://youtu.be/6-xPIgRLuBE?t=0,"['What is the yield of a two-part spray foam insulation package?', 'How do I choose the right manufacturer for my area?', 'What are the differences between various types of spray nozzles?', 'Can you explain how to properly use and maintain the gun and hoses with the tanks?', 'What safety precautions should be taken when working with spray foam insulation?']"

So this gun has a safety on it to attach a nozzle just get it orientated wait right there's usually some marks in the end of the gun that correspond to the the way the nozzle looks. And just push it in there on this one this little lever here you should just hear it click in like that. And just look to make sure that the little believer hook down on the lock knob on the top of the nozzle. So putting the nozzle on just like that taking it off squeeze this button pull it off when you're spraying if you stop for more than about thirty seconds you're probably gonna find that you'll have to change your nozzle. So it's a good idea get yourself all set up get things out of the way. So that once you start spraying you can just kind of keep going with it. And you aren't losing a bunch of time otherwise you're gonna have to change your nozzles what happens is the two components come in each come in their own hose. And once they hit the nozzle there's a kind of a spiral ii set up inside of the nozzle here that actually starts to mix the two homes because until the two products mixed together they don't actually have the chemical reaction which causes them to expand. And cure. So if you stop for too long it starts to set up in here. And it clogs. And it's not gonna work properly. So that's why they send you multiple ones. So if you stop pop your tip off put a new one on. And away you go again they also in this bag sent some petroleum jelly. So what they'd like you to do is smear some of the jelly right inside of the gun here. And that just helps to allow your your tips not to seal up rate at the end of the gun. So you can just throw your tip way put anyone on. And everything should be fine. So we've got the jelly optimally your tanks need to be around are usually about 24 degrees celsius around. So that'd be what i don't know about 79 78 degrees fahrenheit to get the most yield out of them. And to make everything work properly. So keep them somewhere stored warm you can spray on to a cooler surface. But you don't want something that's frosty. And wet. So like here where we're doing this in february. And it's a below grade. So the wall is cool. But it's actually still about 2 degrees celsius. So and there's no frost present. So that's your tanks once we're ready to,https://youtu.be/6-xPIgRLuBE?t=193,"['What type of safety does the gun have?', 'How do you attach the nozzle to the gun?', 'What happens if you stop spraying for too long?', 'Why are multiple nozzles sent with the product?', 'At what temperature should the tanks be stored?']"

So that's your tanks once we're ready to go we're gonna open both valves on the tanks completely you're gonna see the product start to come down the line once once it fills up the lines oh before that sorry you should shake the tanks really well - i think it's usually around 3040 seconds you need to agitate the tanks that will just get things mixed together open your valves let it bleed into the lines do your petroleum jelly get your tip ready. And and. Then you're pretty much close to being ready to spray. And obviously before that put on all your your protective equipment protective equipment these guys recommend if you don't have real good ventilation that you should be wearing a respirator similar to this. And it's fitted with cartridges that are for organic vapor as well as particle filtration. So they're kind of a two-part cannister one does the organic part of the chemicals. And the other just does the any solids that might be in the air. So so it's important to have that if you don't have the proper ventilation we did a did a video with us with a similar product there a while ago. And we had a lot of people freaking out because we weren't wearing a mask we did talk in the video how we had lots of ventilation. And everything. But we still had people kind of freaking out. So we've actually gonna redo this video today. And we don't have the ventilation here quite as good we just were able to open a couple windows. So we're gonna use the mask for sure also some rubber gloves to protect your hands you already see that i have the the painters suit on or the bodysuit on to protect my clothing i'm wearing a hat i'll have safety glasses on. So it's just to protect yourself from any spray back that you might get it doesn't happen very often. But you never know you could get some bounce back onto you. So and it doesn't come off that easily you definitely don't want it in your eyes or your mouth or anything like that. So so that's for the protective part i think i've i've shaken the tanks pretty good we'll give him another little shake shake before we go just before i actually use a nozzle. And once i've got the tanks open i'm gonna shoot the gun into a garbage can or a box or in our case we're gonna use a garbage can just to make sure i'm getting two fairly even streams coming out. Then i'll get my tip on. And and start spraying. So when you're spraying it's much like kind of in a way like spraying paint if you've ever had to do that we're gonna come up to the wall we want to be about six or eight inches away from the wall. And we're just gonna you know regulate our speed by hand to put on the amount that we want to see get on. Now remember it's going to expand some. So you don't want to fill the cavity rate up right away or once it expands you're just gonna be having to cut it all off because it's it's sticking out too much you know. So it's simply squeeze the trigger regulate your speed let go of the trigger squeeze. And come down again okay. So you just keep doing that we're gonna do these some of these spaces here in preparation what we've done any electrical boxes you'll want to tape them up or seal them up because once the foam gets in. And around them it'll actually expand into the the open holes. And cavities of the box. And actually end up inside. So you want to prevent that. So we've just wrapped this one in some plastic the wiring is fine to be embedded in the spray foam that isn't a problem we've just basically brushed the wall off made sure it wasn't covered in any cobwebs. And dust. And that if the wall is damp or frosty or anything you you want to make sure you warm it up. And dry it off before you spray this on that won't bond to the concrete as well you will get some probably overspray onto some of your framing materials here we've just got two by twos. But that will clean off with a scraper fairly easily once it secured anything that's around the area that you don't want to get foam on just paulie it up or tape it off or whatever just to be sure you aren't getting some overspray on anything that you didn't want to cover. So we're gonna spray some rate on this concrete wall i'm gonna go up. And do a couple cavities in that wood wall too it's really just the same thing. But i just thought i'd show it since we can i think that's pretty much covering everything that i'd talked about again,https://youtu.be/6-xPIgRLuBE?t=353,"['What type of protective equipment is recommended for handling chemicals?', 'How long should you shake the tanks before spraying?', 'Why is it important to have good ventilation when working with chemicals?', ""What happens if you get overspray on framing materials or other areas you don't want to cover?"", 'How do you regulate the speed and amount of spray foam applied to a surface?']"

So that's kind of handy to know where you're at. But just keep them inside. So they're they're warmed up. And good to go you don't want to directly you know blast a furnace on them or wrap them in electrical heat blanket or something like that not nothing that extreme. But just make sure they're warmed up well okay. So i'm going to put on my protective equipment you may not be able to hear me as well with the mask on. So that's why i was trying to cover everything here well before i get all suited up. But i may may do bit of talking with the mask on. But it may not be that clear. So so i'm just going to break away here for a minute get my personal personal protective equipment on. And then we'll come back. And show you how to spray [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [applause] [applause] [applause] [music] [music] okay. So we've let things sit here for a little bit. And let the fumes get out. So we can take the mask off. And finish up you can see it's expanded out nicely it's nice. And firm if you get a wrong mixture sometimes you'll get a clogged line or something. So if you get too much of one of the chemicals. And i can't remember which way it is you'll actually get soft mushy foam. And if it goes the other way where the other chemical is is too much the foam is really brittle in. And it almost just doesn't stand up if you touch it it actually crumbles away right away where this is well this is good this is nice. And firm that's exactly what we want. So now the next step that we're kind of at. And some actually something i didn't mention was in most areas if you spray up the two inches you more than likely will not,https://youtu.be/6-xPIgRLuBE?t=634,"['What type of temperature gauge do the foam canisters have?', 'Why is it important to keep the foam canisters inside?', 'What should not be used to warm up the foam canisters?', 'How does a wrong mixture affect the foam?', 'What happens when there is too much of one chemical in the mixture?']"

So just check with your local codes on that the one thing to consider when doing that. And you notice that i put on two to three different coats like passes. So that those first couple get a chance to actually cure before you cover them up. And form that skin over it which gives you that that airlock or that air stoppage because what's gonna happen. Now you can see where some of this foam has expanded past the actual framing. So i'm gonna go back you know. And trim it back flush. So now if i did had done that all in one pass. Now that i cut that that probably compromises the vapor barrier qualities of it where because i've got those couple passes in behind that i'm not going to be cutting into in my opinion that's still pretty good. So in this case we're we're actually only in most in a lot of this we're a little less than an inch. And a quarter or inch. And a half thick. So we'll we're gonna need. And from my area we're gonna need another vapor barrier anyways. But something to consider. So if you're free if you're spraying into a 2x4 wall where you've got the the ability to spray at two or two. And a half inches thick go ahead. And do it check with your local building authority because you may not have to put a vapor barrier over after okay let's move on. So we've got it all sprayed you can see i'm just taking a utility knife.

And you go to drywall over top of that it's it's gonna give you some issues with pop screws. And that sort of thing okay. So just keep going around another thing you can use is the old handy red bar scrape things down get right underneath it scrape it off like that once the foam is is - its secured point this is not hazardous anymore you can throw this right in the garbage don't eat it throw it in the garbage.

So we've got a stairwell here. And we are going to put handrail along two sides we've actually got three videos for this particular job we've got one showing how to install these posts  we're gonna have one showing putting in the hand rails. And the sole plate on the floor. And another one showing putting in the iron balusters. So stay tuned. And let's have a look okay. So if you refer back to my other video where i show how to install these the new posts in that video i talk about how to determine where you want to put your poles. And and this railing. And everything. So just refer back to that that's kind of your starting point anyways for this process. And from here on we're going to be dealing solely with putting in the actual handrail. And the bottom sole plate that goes on the floor okay. So i've loosened my posts off because i kind of need them to be a little bit movable while i do this i'm going to install this section here first this small piece you might have noticed in these two poles i've already got studs in there to connect the handrail. But this is the stud i've got to put one more in here. So it has a coarse threaded end here that that fastens into the post. And then there's a machine screw thread here for a nut that goes on. So this is going to be in the pole in the post i mean. And the handrail will slip over the end. And then there's this  piece here that fits over with the nut. And you tighten it all up. And that's that's the connection for the handrail to the posts. And then to cover up the holes which i'll show you after there's a there's a plug wooden plug to match. So so anyways i i don't have this one stud in here. But they're pretty simple just use a pair of vice grips. And clamp onto the fine threaded part closer to the where the two threads change you don't want to clamp on too far out here because that's where your knot's got to go on. And if you mess up those three heads. Then it's not gonna work very well. So i pre-drilled the hole here  it depends on which size of the this you have for your hole. So i won't even talk about the size of the hole i guess pre-drill according to what you have it takes a little bit to kind of get it to start in there it's easier if i laid it on a table. But once it starts it'll grab. And just thread in. So you want to thread it right in until those coarse threads disappear try not to scratch your post swinging the vice grips by okay. So that's going to be pretty good okay i've got this post loose just because i'm going to need that that way to get things kind of assembled here. Now so we've got our two full posts over here. And over here on the wall we're going to have a half new. So it's generally you're going to use one that's half as thick. And in our case we've got no wood or anything up in the upper area to attach to. So i'm going to use a butterfly bolt hollow wall anchor type thing. So i've got that all kind of pre-drilled in here. So that's this hole i'm going to put a wood plug in there afterwards down at the bottom down here i will be able to get a wood screw through the post. And into the bottom plate of the wall. And it'll be hidden by the sole plate which is a wood base that's going to sit out here between the posts. So i've pre-drilled a hole there. And countersunk it. So that's all ready this hole here is going to be where i put a screw through the back side it's going to come through. And into the end of the handrail instead of using one of those type of bolts i can simply use a screw for this. So that's the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to attach the hand rail,https://youtu.be/lYLg1ZKn-6A?t=0,"['What type of stud is used to connect the handrail to the posts?', 'How does the coarse threaded end fasten into the post?', 'Why is it important not to clamp on too far out when using vice grips?', 'What type of anchor is used for attaching the half new to the wall?', 'Can a screw be used instead of bolts for attaching the handrail?']"

And stuff because  your situation is going to be different than mine. So giving you measurements that i'm using probably isn't going to mean anything to your project. But basically what i did is i figured out the height of my balusters that are going to go in here total height marked that on this post. And drilled that hole according to where it will be in here in this case i'm up i'm going to be up 7 8 of an inch from the bottom of the handrail to the center of my hole. So you just got to figure all your situation out for what you want to do. But the first thing i want to do is basically put these two pieces together. So i'll get this a little awkward by myself here. But we'll get this screw started in. And poking out. So i can see what i'm doing okay. So i've got the point of the screw sticking through there. So i can line it up with the hole i've already drilled here. And that hole is just to keep you from splitting the handrail just relieves some of the pressure instead of driving that screw right in there come on where are you i need a little bit more sticking out [applause] oh you know what i didn't do i didn't countersink the back side of this. So that this head of the screw will be flush i need this to go flat to the drywall. So i need to do that do that quick. And i'll be right back okay. So i just drilled a hole there on the back side. So that this head of this screw will sink in. And not be protruding through it doesn't have to look pretty because nobody's going to see this after see if we can manage this. Now okay. So we've got that attached. Now you can see that,https://youtu.be/lYLg1ZKn-6A?t=258,"['What is the purpose of drilling holes before attaching handrail components?', 'How do you determine the height of balusters for a project?', 'Why did the creator not countersink the back side of the screw?', 'What is the significance of the 7 8 inch measurement from the bottom of the handrail?', 'How does the creator ensure the handrail is securely attached to the drywall?']"

So we've got that attached. Now you can see that i've centered the handrail in the width of the post generally your new posts are going to be wider than the handrail. So centered it up. And like i said i've got this  butterfly bolt on the back side that i've got to put through this larger hole here. And i'll be able to drive a wood screw in the bottom. Now the reason i've got this loose is. So that once i have this over there all on the wall i'm hoping i can tilt this big post out far enough to get the bolt into this hole that i machined in the the end of the rail. So there's going to be that bolt going in that hole. And then if i can show you here i've drilled this larger one-inch hole at the bottom the bolt to go in here i'll be able to see the threads there get the nut started on. And tighten it up. And that's what is going to connect this to that pole okay. And again i'm not talking about any of the measurements because depending on which fasteners you get it's all going to be different likely than what i have anyways. Now i've got marks on the floor. So i know where the the front side of this post is going to be it's going to be on this red chalk line i don't know if you can make that out. And height wise my butterfly should line up with that hole. And it does. So i think that's all good,https://youtu.be/lYLg1ZKn-6A?t=400,"['What type of fasteners are being used in the project?', 'How wide will new posts typically be compared to the handrail?', 'Can you explain the purpose of the loose butterfly bolt on the back side of the post?', 'Why is a larger hole drilled at the bottom of the rail for the bolt?', 'What measurements are taken into consideration when choosing fasteners?']"

And it does. So i think that's all good. And i want to put just a little bit of adhesive on the back of this to help hold it as well it'll just stick it right onto the drywall if you had wood in there it'd be a little simpler we could just use wood screws. And screw it to the wall. But i don't need much just a little bit extra something to grab there i just want to make sure i don't smear it all over the wall here. So with any butterfly i've gotta collapse it. And start it into the hole oops you're able to see okay. And the butterfly will open up inside there. Now while i'm at it i'm just going to get this kind of in there to help hold things up for me. So part way there. So like i said i've got this mark down on the floor i know that's where the bottom of my bottom face of this half new is going to be. So i can probably just put this screw in. And then i'll plumb the pole up. And tighten that butterfly okay. So that's one [applause] okay once that adhesive grabs a hold of there it'll help hold everything tight there too okay. And we've got this end we've got it onto the bolt. And what happens over here is i've got to get all this stuff up in that hole. And onto the end of the bolt we're going to try to get you a little better look it's kind of awkward to to show this. But you can see the hole you can see the stud up there sticking through. And now i've got to try to get this nut on the end there somehow it's very awkward i think i got it started i'll try to spin it with my finger a little bit to get it on there more there we go okay. So i've got it started on there. And now i can tighten it up a little bit okay that drawed that nice. And tight. Now the one thing i didn't do was see if the handrail was sitting square here it's pretty good there got lucky. But i should have just double checked that that was sitting straight. And wasn't twisted otherwise i just have to loosen that off. And twist it straight again okay. So we've got  got that piece of handrail on. Now actually i think i was gonna put the shoe piece on. But i think actually i might as well just continue with the handrail here. And i should be able to slip those shoes in there  after the fact. So let's  probably get the camera in a little different angle. And continue with the handrail on this side okay. So we got that short little piece of handrail done. Now i think i should be able to pop this piece on. And getting it get it tightened up if i can get it started by myself. And again this one's all machined on the bottom. And the ends like the other one was okay. So i'm going to go ahead. And get these bolts in. And get that tightened up okay one of the final things i'm going to show you today.

Then is to put on this shoe molding or base molding. And i've already got it cut to fit obviously. So i've got it notched around any posts. And there's a small miter back behind this post you probably can't see it's right there. So i've got i i made this you can buy different ones. But i made this to work for this application. And i've got it set up. So it'll be flush to the front of all the posts on the outside. And it hangs off on the inside in the opening just a little bit. So that i can add a molding layer underneath it to cover the edge of the tattered up drywall. So i've kind of got these posts still loose. So that i can manipulate them a little bit until i'm happy with how all this is going to fit we'll put that in there again depending on your situation or how you're doing yours this may not be identical obviously. So but yeah. So i've got things nice. And flush out here out there at the other ends. And then obviously down here at the end as well. So i'm pretty happy with that fit i'm just going to use a few brad nails to hold that in place. And once i go to do my balusters i'll drive the odd screw in right underneath the baluster to you know permanently secure it. And my air pressure must not be air pressure or my gun oh my guns deep i'm not too sure got lots of air pressure. So that one sunk. And i'm going to put a little bit of glue in the miter joint here just some wood glue. So [applause] [applause] okay. Now one of the last things i'm gonna just show you is all those larger holes that we used for the different fastening devices that we had we're going to put a wood plug in as i mentioned before. So i'm going to put this one in here. And just put a little bit of glue on it. And when you put plugs like this in you want to kind of look at the green this one you can't really tell. But sometimes on the bigger ones you can see the green whoops. So you want to orientate it same as what's on the wood that you're that you're putting it into just put it in there wipe off the excess sometimes they'll sit out. And protrude just a little bit. And if it does just sand it after this one's going to just sit in there nice. So you go along you put ones in up there. And in the posts where those bigger holes are just glue them all in. And and they'll be fine. So that's the basics the basics here of the wooden part of this railing look for my next video we're going to install the install these baluster this style of baluster inside here. And we'll show you how to do that. But for right. Now that's that's this video i'm glad that you watched.

And today we're going to put the subfloor onto the floor deck. So in my other videos you you've already watched you would have seen me installing all the floor joist framing in the stairwell down there getting this all ready. So now we can finally sheet it. And get our floor system covered. So that we can start framing some walls. So i'll just talk a few minutes about  the basic procedure. So we're using tongue. And groove plywood  these sheets right. Now are turned upside down this will be the first row that's going to go here they're turned upside down cuz. Then i can just flip them right into into place. And secure them. So you'll see a little bit later when i start the second row takes a little bit of finesse to get the tongue. And groove to lock together for the subsequent rows this first row is pretty straightforward  i will be snapping a chalk line along here as a guide. So what i did in my case i measured 4 1/4 in marked a line on both ends. And i'll snap a chalk line there. And that will allow me to line up the  groove side of my plywood to that you're always trying to put the tongue into the groove as you're as you're working on the sheets. And that's. So that you don't damage the tongue  maybe i should show you what i'm talking about since i've got a small piece here. So when we're talking about tongue. And groove the edges of the panel one side has this groove here. And one side has a tongue. And the two interlock together to help  keep the floor flat. And stop squeaks. And that a couple other things we're going to be using a  a a spray bond adhesive instead of just a adhesive that's in a cocking gun like a like a pl construction adhesive which is what i typically use i haven't actually used a product like this  before. But they're kind of what everybody's using. Now so i thought well i better give it a a try. And show it in this video. So basically it is this canister that you buy. And if you don't have one of these guns for spraying spray foam. And that sort of thing. Then you need this gun as well the canister just  screws onto the gun i don't know they might all have a little different instructions this one said to  shake for  well it says 30 times. But i shook it for 30 seconds cuz i think that's pretty sure what what they meant 30 times seems a little odd. So this is the application or the gun to app to apply it. And that glue is going to go on every surface that the subfloor needs to stick to. And bond to. So that'll be all the edges of the rim joint joist. And every every   joist itself. So you'll see that a little bit more in detail when we get going. So the the idea of this is it goes on it's going to come out kind of looking like foam. And then it's going to turn a little bit jelly. And it creates a good bond between the two this says i only have two or 3 minutes it cures. And tack free is 2 to 3 minutes. And set time is 15 minutes. So i'm a little bit confused on that honestly. But i i'm pretty sure i only have two or 3 minutes to basically get my plywood in place. And and  screwed down i'm going to be screwing it down with 2in screws i don't have a fancy standup quick screw gun or anything like that. So i'm just using a my normal impact driver. And some 2-in deck screws. So it will be a little bit slower. And because i'm working by myself that's going to slow it down too normally you could be one guy could be gluing. And setting the sheets. And another person could just be going. And and screwing them down behind you. So but i'll be by myself today  something else that could be a little different from what you're doing i've got these bays  over top the concrete wall  on the walls that are parallel to the joist there's no way to get in there. And insulate it or vapor barrier or anything after this plywoods on there's there's no there's basically a a/ quar in space between the styrofoam of my icf on the inside. And the bottom cord of my joist first joist. So what i have done is i've put two layers of 2in foam down in the bottom laying flat. And two ines of 2in foam up against the rim board as well. And then i filled the rest of the void just with some rockol insulation that probably isn't necessary. But i figured as well. So i cut the pie pieces a little bit loose. And then i applied spray foam around all the edges. And stuff. So i'm trying to create that vapor barrier. And insulation using this  because i'm not going to have any kind of access to spray foam it or or anything afterwards. So so that's what you see here is the styrofoam that's sticking up on the face of the sill  the other horizontal stuff is laying down obviously behind  underneath the rocks all. So now the other issue with that is you can see i cut cut them a little bit short i didn't want them interfering with the plywood. And plus i want a gap here because i'm going to spray some canned foam on top of these areas where i've got them. So that it can  expand. And seal to the bottom side of the plywood. And that should give me my air seal that i need. So anyways your your situation might not be like that you might have access from the bottom  if we had a normal 8 in just standard concrete wall i would have access this wall is about 12. And 3/4 i think with the icf forms because of the rigid foam on each side i'm going to have lots of insulation value in all my ends like this because i'm also doing inch. And a half foam on the very outside of the whole home. So so we're going to have tons of insulation the reason i snap this line is you always want to make sure you're starting out straight st don't necessarily trust your your rim joist i mean even as good of a job as you did maybe to get it straight  i wouldn't trust that i'd always trust a string line  you want that first row to be straight otherwise you're just going to have problems every row after that. And it's just going to any little deviation is going to magnify every row you you do after that. So so snap a line start your first row in line with that. And you should be good another thing that i like to do is  my last sheets that hang off the end here they're hanging off 6 fet i usually cut them to size or just a little bit bigger cuz i'll go around afterwards. And snap actual lines on the outside. And recut everything just to to straighten it up if it's just hanging off a few inches i'll just screw it all down. And i'll just leave it there. And i'll cut it off after when i do my my straight cuts. So in this case i've got my first piece already cut. So we're good  something else to remember  even the butt ends of your plywood of your subfloor should have about an e/ inch space if you got a small nail in your pouch or something that you can just kind of use as a gauge or just eyeball it just stick it between the sheets if you're not sure. And that just gives the sheets a little bit of room to expand. And contract if you have that room. Then they can they can do what they need to do. And they don't buckle. And end up doing this. And then that teg rafts through any flooring you have. And everything. So try to leave that space i think that's all i can really tell you,https://youtu.be/d0Su7RWG2Rk?t=0,"['What type of plywood is being used for the subfloor?', 'Why are the first few rows of tongue and groove plywood turned upside down?', 'How does the tongue and groove system help keep the floor flat?', 'What is the purpose of using a spray bond adhesive instead of traditional construction adhesive?', 'What is the recommended application time for the spray bond adhesive?']"

So try to leave that space i think that's all i can really tell you. So to start out with i'm going to do this first little corner here. And i'll glue it down. And screw it. And everything oh no i've got to snap my line remember that's the first thing to do okay. So i've got a mark here i've got my chalk line hooked on a nail down at that far end. So i'll go down. And wheel it off this way. And i like to use red for all this stuff it's very permanent though. So you want to watch what you get it on including your clothes you notice as i walked i'm trying to keep it up off the wood as well until i'm ready to get completely lined up if i just kind of nonchalantly drag that line along as i'm spooling it out. Now i've got a smudge or a bunch of other lines that  when i get down to that end i can't really tell what i'm supposed to be lining it up with. So i'm keeping it up off the surface i'm trying to lower it down as close to on my mark here as i can right from the start. So that i don't have multiple lines. And it looks like it snapped all the way across same thing picking it up you want to just take it straight up. And get it out of the way before it leaves a smudge okay. So it left a good line i'm happy with that i'll just mention here too over in this area is where the stairwell is. And i'm not going to cut that plywood out until later until the walls are up because i don't want that open hole to be a hazard. So i've just put this a couple of 2x sixes in there just to give a little bit of  stability to the sheets when people walk on it they don't feel like they're going to fall through there okay woohoo just like that okay. So i've got my my line,https://youtu.be/d0Su7RWG2Rk?t=485,"['What is the first step in creating a chalk line?', 'Why is red chalk used for this task?', 'How does the author ensure the chalk line remains straight?', 'What happens when the chalk line snaps?', 'Where is the stairwell located in relation to the plywood sheet?']"

So i've got my my line here get my drill close by. So i know where where i need to go with my foam i'm just going to go a little bit further than my sheet i'm going to do it first cuz i know i've got a little bit more working time with with [applause] it okay. So that can kind of do its thing i had a little bit of cleaner in the end there that's why it looked clear okay. So you can see how that kind of came out. And it's. Now it's kind of settling down turning into a bit of a gel  these sheets will be marked an upside. And a downside. So make sure you're putting them the right direction would have been a little probably better to start with a bigger piece to get a little more true start to the line. But i think we're pretty good there pull it back this way a bit remember i cut it large just to be sure i had you know i can cut a nice straight square line here after i'm pretty happy with that. So screw wise around the edges you want to go about every six or eight inches. And out in the field like out in in the middle of the sheet you can go every 12 in. And keep your screws back about an inch. And a half from the edge just having another quick double check to make sure i'm all right looks good auto feed screw gun is definitely quicker than this. But is what it is this is what i have. And as a diy i doubt you have an auto feed  gun as either some of your  sheathing materials that you could be purchasing or using may already have pre-marked spots on it for the screws for the screws. And i would use screws instead of nails no matter what with these  type of joist that i'm using you got lots of surface area it's not like you're trying to  join a couple sheets on a inch. And a half wide joist anymore. So i'm able to keep my screws back easily 3/4 of an inch to an inch. And still hit the wood below okay. So there's my first sheet  i guess i didn't get all the screws over here okay. So there's number one.

So there's number one. So on my next sheet i overlap into this area an area again where i've got some foam because i can't insulate it afterwards. So i've got to make sure i get some spray foam on here. And then i can glue just my joist here in this outside perimeter cuz it the joint ends up the joint's going to be just right here inside the stairwell. So okay. So let's get the spray foam on there. And then the [applause] glue the stuff's  not sure if i mentioned i think it's urethane polyurethane based if anybody's wondering if anybody cares just got to get this adjusted to where i like it kind of looks like spray foam when you first dispense it okay. So i've got my this row of sheets sitting actually upside down. So that i can just flip them basically over into place kind of getting it close to my line there okay i'm just checking my chalk line right there. And i want my space in between here remember i'm pretty good. So i'm looking at my chalk line looking at my space here. And i'm happy [music] okay. So because i'm going to cut this out later like down the road in the future  if i have a marker i do i'm going to put some marks on here. So i kind of know where this hole is when the time comes. And it'll save a little bit of messing around. So i'm just just putting a mark so i know that that's the edge there. And hopefully that'll still be there a month from. Now when i'm cutting that out okay. So our next next sheet isn't going to need a bunch of screws because it's mostly covering the opening. But i've got to seal the the edge for sure. And i'll just go ahead. And get this whole row done. And then we'll come back.

But basically once you get yourself lined up where you kind of want to be. And and hopefully the tongue started all the way along just use a beater block okay i'm pretty good at this end i need a little bit of this end. Now that end will probably come out a bit we'll see all that's pretty good. So you just want to persuade it in there again you want to leave yourself don't beat it in there too tight leave yourself a gap there you can see the gap between the sheets it's definitely helpful if you can kind of stand on the sheet when you're screwing it the sheet's kind of warped. So you can see we're having another person with you to give you hand would be beneficial speed things up this  size floor definitely probably take me all day by myself [music] again just making a little note here of how far over from this joint that cut would be must be doing something right they're both the same. So now this next one i think is going to be a pain because of this rim joist being. So close. But we'll see yeah this part here is being a bit of a pain because it's in that stairwell. So it's not quite sitting how it normally would see if i can i think i have it started it's going it's getting pretty decent pretty nice there. Now i just need to get a little better gap between the sheets end to end hopefully i can persuade it over a bit there we go all right it's not. So bad we're going to call that good. So you can see where if you don't start out straight you're going to be fighting it all day it's a bit of a fight as it is or it can be.

And repeat keep doing that  like i said when i'm all done i will measure. And mark lines on the end. And cut off all those cut offs  some sometimes when they're less well really you shouldn't have a shouldn't have a joint lining up in row to row. And they should be at least two joists apart as well. So a lot of times those short little pieces aren't going to work anywhere anyways. So i just cut them off when it's all done. And that squares the floor up nice tight. So so i've got a little bit well let's face it i've got a lot more subfloor. And screwing to do. So i don't think you want to watch me do this whole thing.

And you're going to need a small cocking gun. And some acoustical sealant  that's this black stuff that you can see i've already got on there very messy stuff. So be as careful with it as you can. And then i also use tuck tape for sealing some of the joints. And that we'll get to all those different processes as we go. So to start out with  the situation we have you can see i've got some done here already behind us we've come down a wall here. And around the corner. And i've got it all sealed with the acoustical as you can see up in the corner  we've got a little bit of a different situation here at the end here you can see we've got the rim joist area.

But way back in there there is insulation already. But we need to bring the seal that we have here on this wall needs to be actually right on this joist to complete the seal. So on this side wall we're going to come up the wall. And across. And seal. And staple to here we're on this wall we're under the rim joist area i just simply sealed it along here. And i'm going to deal with this in a different manner  we do have  some videos showing you a few different ways to actually insulate. And seal these joist box joists because they are a little bit difficult to do  they can be done with poly they can be done with spray foam. And they can also be done with  a combination of bad insulation. And 2-in rigid foam that's sealed with canned spray foam. So so you might want to look at those videos to deal with that area we're just dealing with a normal flat wall we are in a basement. So we're not doing the ceiling. But if you were on your main floor much of this pertains to exactly the same thing  except that you would also be doing the same process up on the ceiling as well. So i normally what i would do is i would do my walls. And then i would install the ceiling right over to the corner let it come down. And then  where it comes down i i would seal that to this to the wall stuff that's already done. But really it's just like dealing with with the wall except that you're working over your head okay. So we've gone ahead. And just got the  poly cut to length normally i would just roll the roll out lean on the wall. And try to do it as continuous as i can. But for this demonstration  i had a cut here already for this demonstration we're just doing a smaller piece. So that you can see the less joints the better because  you know there's less sealing to do less chance of not getting sealed. So we've cut a piece off like i said just to do this demo we've got it already started to be hung up there normally like on this wall i just brought it up. And i was able to use this top plate as a guide to kind of get my length right. So i'm straight. And everything. And i just went along stapled it let it drape down. And finished it off after here like i said we're actually sealing around the corner. And up here instead of here. So what i i did is i just pre-marked the poly at the distance i wanted. So that i can use these marks as a reference here. So that i get everything straight. And i. And i don't run short on the poly. So so we just kind of did that ahead of time. But so basically just let it drape down oops don't get tripped up on it get it around my ladder okay. So these marks i had were just running along the top plate here. So that i have this lip to work with one thing you want to do is when you staple don't staple initially don't staple right where you're going to be acoustic try to keep your staples down a bit. So you can pull the poly down run your bead of acoustical. Then pull the poly up smear it into the acoustical. And staple it in place if i was to staple it up here. Then i'm trying to peel down this little thing. And you're just going to have a mess. So just you can see i've given myself a flap there to work with once you have the poly kind of started you can keep yourself straight by just letting it hang. And it you know it's not all full of wrinkles when you get into corners especially when you're going around a corner. And continuing on make sure you have you know a bit of a fold of the poly in there  if you pull it across too tight let's say you've got staples here. And staples over here. But this isn't going right back into the corner when you go to drywall or somebody goes to drywall it they're either going to cut that or they're just going to have a heck of a time getting the drywall corner nice. So make sure you got a little bit of a ripple back there. So they can get their board or their finishing material right back in nice. So so you can see i've got just a few staples in it's hanging pretty good obviously you want to make sure it goes right down to the floor. And and have a little bit of excess as well  you can see we have one receptacle down here we'll deal with that as we get to it. So you basically get a hanging level i don't like to go too hog wild with the staples  especially if you're going to be covering it up in fairly short order you know within a week or. So it's really not a big deal. So i basically what i'll do is about every couple feet every second stud. And i'll just  put some staples in just to hold it back. And that's it's just  keeping it taunt. And and flat. And it kind of keeps the insulation from having a chance to move around okay. So just go along like that just kind of use my hand to keep it smooth. And pulled pulled a little bit tight i get over to the corner here we're going to be running a bead of acoustical in the corner. So as long as i've got this flap here i'm good. So i'm going to staple it on this stud. So i can pull it back. And acoustic back there or tape okay. So we've kind of got that all just roughly hanging. And i haven't stapled right to the floor because again i need to be able to pull this up. And get under there to work. And not have acoustical all over me. So so we've got it hanging there i've got my acoustical ready. And i'm i'm not going to do the whole thing i'm just going to show you basically what you need to do. So like i said i'm going to do the up here don't go too crazy with this stuff cuz like i said it is messy. And if you get it on you especially your clothes you're going to wish you'd never seen it i think mineral spirits is about the only thing that effective effectively cleans this off okay we had a bit of a patch in the corner here to make this transition. So just in case you're wondering what all that is going on there. So i need to actually get back to my original spot. And then back over this poly. And then i'm going right down this corner. And i don't know if you can even see. Now with my back to you. And everything. But i'm just going right down over the first layer of poly that i had in there just putting a bead trying to keep my new sheet out of the way. And i'm just going to go right to the floor here you could tape this joint as well with which is less messy okay. So i'm going right down okay when you when you're dealing with this it's really stringy. So you don't want to just stop. And pull it away from the wall just kind of work with it. And and get the little strings wrapped up or tied up. So they don't get on everything. Now when i go across the floor  many times if you didn't seal your bottom plate in this this case to wood or in this case to concrete. But it could be to wood as well. Then you'd want to run that bead of acoustical right down in the corner to seal that joint right up in this case we've got the plate sealed already. So i just need to get this on the  plate itself right here i'm running over top of an area that's already sealed on the first go around. So you aren't going to see what i'm doing till i get out here. But now i'm i'm off onto some new wood okay. So like i said if if your plate wasn't sealed you'd be right down in that corner there okay. And i'm just going to stop there always have a scrap of poly to lay that gun on. So that it's not dripping on your floor. And then you're walking in it or something okay. So just get my poly down  what i do with my stapler okay bring my poly over. And remember i said get some you know make sure sure there's this is pushed back in there a little bit. So there's it's not pulled tight across the corner press that right back into that acoustical that you had there. And staple right through the acoustical if you do that which i don't know if you can even see that because i'm working in the corner the stapler caught the sheet as it went by. So if you miss or puncture it anywhere where's the end of my roll here it is just take a bit of this red tuck tape that's used commonly used on  you know hose wrap. And that sort of thing works really good to  seal you know lp joints lapped over joints. And stuff in this too or punctures  where was i right there i try to do those as soon as i make them because otherwise you forget where it is. And sometimes they're hard to find find find the the  flog again okay. So i'll just  continue working my way up here. And get this all sealed in i'm going about every on these acoustical joints i'm going about every 6 or8 ines to make sure your staples are right in. Now you see how this you know these inside corners are kind of tricky cuz the paie wants to to fold. And bandon stuff. So you see how it just kind of naturally made this first fold like that. But if i just simply push this up there's actually a an air gap through here where air could come through. So now once i staple this first fold i'm going to actually put some acoustical in there. So that when this gets all up there it's it is sealed right up. And you don't have a some air passage through there. So that just closes that all right back up you can see how stringy that is if you're kind of zoomed in there. So now when i fold this up. And staple it that just creates its own seal right there. And again i'm making sure i've got some excess up in here. So when this is drywalled it's not interfering not interfering with anything okay. So it's important to try to staple through the acoustical as much as you can. So it's kind of sealing up most of those staple holes okay. So we've come down the corner. And across the floor let's finish this corner off quickly [music] okay. And i was able to keep my fold o away from the acoustical down there. So i don't have to do the same thing as as happened up there. And i'm just making sure this comes down i'm just pressing it into that acoustical you can always tell when you've made contact with the acoustical cuz it turns really black otherwise it kind of looks like that it's kind of milky when you're just not having contact okay. So you just continue that all the way around wherever you need to make that seal like i said we could have just used the red tape there. And and sealed this lap instead of this bead back here. But i wanted to just show you that that way. Now like i said we'd go all the way around. And and finish that off. But you kind of get the idea of that i'm going to show you how to do the,https://youtu.be/7cz4y1U7bi0?t=60,"['What tools are needed for house construction?', 'How does acoustic sealant work?', 'Why is it important to staple poly over studs?', 'Can you use spray foam instead of poly?', 'How do you seal a joist box with canned spray foam?']"

So around the electrical before we put this up there's already a vapor box around it the wirings ran through there it's acoustically sealed. And that's that's keeping the box from leaking a air. And and moisture. So what we need to do is get that box sealed to this sheet. Now so just take your  knife. Now you don't want to cut that box that's behind there. So just be careful that you don't push through too far just cut this out. Now what some guys will do is actually cut this hole that i just cut big enough that they could just tape just like that. But when you try to push on there you're not it's hard to get a good seal. So what i do is i cut this hole just a hair bigger than the metal box. And i pull this flange that's around that vapor box through the poy. And get it out onto this surface like that okay. So now i just find it easier to to tape this when the when that's pulled through to this side like i said this tape seals really well you could do acoustical around here if you wanted. But because of the messiness of it i usually don't okay just make sure you got it stuck right on there go all the way around like i mentioned the the wires in this box should be have acoustical around them as well to make that seal otherwise otherwise you're kind of defeating the [music] purpose okay. So most penetrations like this electrical or  even some plumbing the tape is a lot of times a good option for sealing that kind of thing up. So if  when you are running multiple pieces you definitely want to make sure like here's our end you definitely want to make sure that when this next piece goes on i come back to a a stud cuz it's easier to seal on this stud than to try to work over here where it's not quite meeting the stud. So my next piece i would get it hanging up. So it at least laps by by a couple inches run my acoustical on here or even tape. And seal that joint up  i i wouldn't recommend trying to just butt it up against your last cut. And seal even if it is on a stud make sure you get at least one stud space overlapped. And seal that up. So i think that pretty much looks after anything that i can think of off top of my head on the whole process we've got going on here. So again i would just have to finish off the acoustical top. And bottom here. And continue on with my next next sheet. So i think the most you know one of the the most important things is just remember to try to seal up as much as you can some people will go. And put tape on every one of these staples it's not i don't know that it's actually required by code  probably not a bad idea. But that is one of the reasons why i don't go. And overload it with staples is the less penetrations the better  my thinking is i don't worry about it when you put your drywall up here it's going to puncture it with every screw you put in as well. But at least the drywall is kind of holding in it pretty tight to the stud. And it kind of doesn't really seal it off. But it will help  reduce the air flow. And the moisture flow. So okay i think that's about it. So this is just dealing with a wall. But a ceiling would be basically the same thing  really not any major changes for the ceiling. So okay.

Now i'm headed up the coast to bellingham washington gina. And ray moore want to do something really interesting with their entryway ceiling i think i might have an idea in mind hi gina hi ron how are you good great hi pleasure to meet you what a nice house you guys have got here thank you how long have you been here about three years wow a lot of nice work you've done here thank you finishing it off let's see all we have left are finished projects on the house. And the ceiling is  the one that we wrote you about ah right here okay yeah. Now you guys were thinking originally about some kind of embossed wallpaper yeah well we wanted sort of a victorian look like the old tin ceilings right not that that would go with the style of the house right. Then we came up with this embossed tile idea which i think is going to be even easier to do. And i think it's going to give you even more detail it's going to look more like that that tin seal all right first thing we want to do is do some layout work up here. So let's grab a couple of ladders. And a couple tape measures. And get started if you're up for it right all right good okay. Now these are the embossed ceiling tiles that we're going to be using today. And there are two ways to put these up you can install these strips of wood called furring strips on the ceiling. And then these tiles simply lay on top the interlock like this. And then simply staple the tabs to the wooden strips or you can do it this way which is the way we're going to do it today using these metal tracks again they attach to the ceiling the tiles go right on top interlocking the same way they would before. But instead of the staples in this case we're going to use this metal clip which just slides right over the tab on the edge of the tile okay guys let's get the length of the ceiling here the first step in determining how we're going to lay out our tiles is measuring the length. And width of the ceiling what's it looking like janet it looks like six three. And a half six feet three. And a half inches yes i'll buy that okay while gina. And ray work on taking down the light fixture i'm off in search of wooden ceiling joists with my stud finder we need to know where the joists are because we'll be attaching the metal tracks to them with screws. Now that we've established the location of the studs we mark their position by striking a chalk line along the length of each one. Then we snap a second series of lines at right angles to the first 12 inches apart these marks will show us where to place the mounting tracks this is our first piece of track here eh with two screws the first section of track is installed the second section though will have to be cut to length. Now this track comes in four foot lengths. So we're going to cut this down to that measurement you made what was that again 27 inches 27 okay. Now this stuff is very easy to cut i use a pair of aviation snips to cut the track what works best is using the tip of the cutters. And nibbling through with a series of small bites in practically no time ray. And gina get the hang of the system quickly working their way across the rest of the ceiling more often than not ceilings are not perfectly flat,https://youtu.be/EwYlrDJGRWU?t=0,"['What type of material were used for the embossed ceiling tiles?', 'How did the designers decide on a Victorian look for the entryway ceiling?', 'What is the purpose of using metal tracks in installing the embossed tile ceiling?', 'Why was it necessary to mark the position of the wooden ceiling joists with chalk lines?', 'What tool was recommended for cutting the metal tracks to length?']"

And adjust them downward by loosening the screw a real advantage of this metal track system. Now in a lot of homes especially older homes the walls are not always straight. And we've got to have one perfectly straight line to start putting these tiles up. So we're going to use a piece of string to get that i've attached it to the wall right here what i want to do is make sure that this string is perpendicular to this strip right here that we put up earlier. So we'll use a carpenter square lay it up in here i've got ray on the other end okay ray move it to the right to the right a little bit more. Now back to the left okay. Now mark it over there on the wall ray has made his mark. And driven a screw into the wall. Now he wraps his end of the string around it the distance between the string. And the wall will be the width of our first row of tiles seven. And three quarters seven. And three quarters okay gina. Now let's we're going to cut these tiles to the width that we need. So let's go ahead. And transfer that measurement you just made that was seven. And three quarters right okay we're not starting our first row with full tiles because if we did based on our measurement of the ceiling we'd end up with a very skinny row on the opposite side,https://youtu.be/EwYlrDJGRWU?t=205,"[""['What is the purpose of using a straight edge across the tracks to check for uneven ceilings?', \n ['How do you adjust uneven ceilings in a metal track system?', \n ['Why is it necessary to have one perfectly straight line when installing tiles?', \n ['How does a carpenter square help with ensuring a string is perpendicular to a strip?', \n ['What is the width of the first row of tiles based on the measurement made by Gina?']""]"

And the walls. But what about the ceiling take a look at what this couple did steven barb hirs called me after seeing wood ceiling panels in a restaurant this is the restaurant here their den ceiling was already beamed.

So that's actually insulating the gap that's left between the framework. And the window frame itself  there's basically two methods one method involves  bad insulation that you they call it chinking. So you'll actually slide this into place in the in that space  the other method.

And the one that i prefer to use is a spray foam. Now you have to be sure you're using a low expanding spray foam made for around windows. And doors  you don't want one that says filling gaps or anything like that or high pressure you're just going to have a mess because it'll actually  bend your window jams. And and door jams out of shape. So you you want the low expansion foam  one that's made for windows. And doors. So we're going to start with that one to begin with. So we've we've got a window here. And we've got two 2x6 framing. So this spray foam comes with a straw. And everything shake the can really well before you start to use it  i like to do my spray foam in two passes.

So that being said what i mean is i want to stick the straw into back into the gap about an inch from the outside edge of the window the back the far side of the window spray that opening about half full let it sit for couple hours or you don't even have to do that half an hour say you know go. And do every window half full. Then come back. And spray again to fill that window up what that does is that. Then when the foam you know you're going to get some that comes outside of the opening that you need to trim off with your knife soon as you trim it it cuts off the outer layer that actually creates a air barrier. So by doing it in two passes the inner one still creates an air barrier for you know 3/4 of the thickness of the window. And you know this last one is giving our value. But not necessarily  air barrier. So i like to do it in two passes we're going to do this one here i'll just show you how to how to go about it i've got another one that i've already done one pass on. So then we'll switch over to that window. And just show you the final pass. So again  i usually start in a in a bottom corner. And work my way up. And i want to stick the straw right back in there just about as far as i can like i said about an inch or 2 ines from the from the far outside edge of the wall. And start filling okay. And you'd continue all the way up to the top come back down to the bottom work around any blocks or shims you have in the way just like. So and. And you'd continue on doing that all the way around the window. And like i said you're wanting to fill that maybe half full or 3/4 full. Now it will expand out a little bit. So usually if you stop at about half full it'll expand enough to about 3/4. And and you should be good. So we're just going to quickly reset the camera couple windows over at one that i already did with the first pass. So we can show you the second pass okay. So we've moved over to a different window. And this one like i said i already sprayed the first  pass in. And i don't know if you can really see it on the camera. But you can see some of the foam down in there. So now what i want to do again is just insert the straw. And do another another bit of a pass here. And up the side as [applause] well. And like i said you would continue yourself all the way around there  once once that has a chance  most of these will cure within a couple hours. And you'll find that it expands out past the window  just go back. And trim it off with your  utility knife once it's fully cured if you get some of this on your hands or your clothes or hopefully not the flooring. But if you get some on there  i know it's hard not to. But don't try to wipe it up when it's still wet let it cure. And then get rid of it if you get it on your hands obviously you're going to want to clean it up right away. But it's a lot easier to clean off of flooring or the wall or anything if it's actually had a chance to cure otherwise you just smear. And make more of a a mess. So so that's spray foaming  to insulate a window. Now we're going to move back to another window that we don't have any insulation in. And we're going to actually use strips of bad insulation i'll show you how to do that okay okay. So now the second method  which really i don't really recommend i usually use the spray foam method myself. But the second method is using a  fiber bad insulation to ,https://youtu.be/0T_vP2l8LOU?t=76,"['What is the recommended method for insulating windows?', 'How does the air barrier work in spray foam window insulation?', 'Why do you need to trim off excess foam during the process?', 'Can you explain the difference between the two methods of window insulation?', 'What happens if you get spray foam on your hands or clothes before it cures?']"

And the framing you want to rip off a piece of insulation about twice that thickness. So we've got about a/ inch or three 3/4 inch gap here i've got about an inch of thickness. Then i've cut it into width we're we've got a 2x6 wall. So i've cut this at about five five. And a half inches. And what you really need is that insulation. And some kind of flat utensil in order to  help slide it. And guide it back in there  i like to use a flat red bar i use a red bar for a lot of things you'll notice in my videos  you could use a butter knife of ruler whatever whatever fits back in that opening. So what you want to do well first of all what you don't want to do is just start i've seen lots of people just ram in as much stuff as they can in there. And think well i've got it full. Now i can't get anything else in it's good that's the worst thing you can do because this type of insulation once you get it too compressed you actually have lost your insulating value value in it. So what we're trying to do is actually take this piece that's why we've taken the time to make it the right size. And and slide it straight back in there as much as we can. Now it does take a bit of fiddling to get it in there. But that's why we've got the red bar. So basically start by just getting it folded on the red bar a little bit. And starting it in there. And once you once you have it in there unless you've got a really tight spot you can almost pinch it. And just slide it right back. And you can kind of tell if you're getting it all balled up or not once you start doing a few of them kind of work it from the back side the front side whichever way seems to work the best get it all in there nice. And and  you can see it's well i don't know if you can see. But i'll do the bottom to show you better. But it's just all nicely fit in there. And does a does a real nice job. So same thing on the bottom we're just going to start it in there we've got a shim on the one side here to work around. So we're starting at that shim i'm trying not to bunch it up i'm just working it along there until i can tell that i've got it right back to the edge. And it looks good it's not just all rammed in there. And hanging out. And snagged up. So like i said i i don't really like to use this method if i don't have to  about the only time i do is if i've got a really large gap in a renovation or something you know we've changed the size of the window because the cost of the spray foam it's usually not that effective if you know we've got a 2in gap to fill it takes a lot of foam  what i have done is used used the bad insulation to fill 3/4 of that gap. And then i'll maybe spray spray foam to the inside because it creates that air seal. And kind of finishes it off. So it's kind of a hybrid between the two. But for most times when you got a half inch or 3/4 of an inch or whatever or less i'll use the spray foam for sure  yeah. So that's that's about all there is to either one of those methods should be good okay.

So, the easiest way to square up something that is rectangular or square or or check that it's square is to measure diagonally from one corner to the other. And vice versa. And if it's square, those  measurements should be the same. So, let's  have a look. And see what we got. So, you need a a long tape measure depending on your size you're building. I'm going to hook this right on the corner. And hopefully without a nail or anything, it'll stay there. And i'll walk around. Okay,. So i am 30 pulling the tight the tape tight. 38'5. So as long as our other diagonal is say within a quarter inch of that, i'm going to be pretty happy. So that was 38t5. Now if we did the math  pythagoras theorem a^2 + b squ. And then take the the square root of that we would know what this should measure. But i didn't bother checking that beforehand. We'll just simply measure. And then we'll know. So be careful if you're doing this walking on top like this. Don't trip on any of these bolts. All right. Oh,. And of course, it got hooked on one of my bolts over there. See if we can get it off of there without going all the way back. Oh, think we're going to be all right. Yep. Okay. So, 38t5 is what we're looking for. So, pull it tight. And i've got 38t 4. And 7/8. I'm calling that close enough to square. And  good enough to get started. Okay. So, we know that our noted that our basement sill plates going around here. We've got a square  base to start off on.

So, that's that's a positive. So. Then the next thing i want to do is  the rim that i'm using is an engineered lumber. And it measures inch. And 3/8. So i'm going to go around. And i'm at each corner i'm going to measure like at this corner down here i'll measure in 3. And eigh 3. And 1/8 this way. And 3. And 1/8 this way. I'll do that on each corner. And. Then i'm going to snap a line. And that's going to give me the inside edge of that  engineered rim board. The reason we need that inside edge. And not just lining our rim board up with the outside, you know, sill plate is that, , you know, this is this is lumber cut from a tree. , as you guys all know, it's not always straight. So, i don't want to trust that outside very edge. And follow it because we might end up being all wavy. But if i measure in at the corners, we know that our diagonals were basically equal. So, we know we're square. So, if i measure at the corners, snap lines,. And i follow that line, that chalk line,. Then my rim board will be straight no matter what's going on out here. I'm going to measure inch. And 38 on each corner first. And. Then i'm going to snap those lines. Where are we? Inch. And 3/8. There. And there. Inch. And 38. I'm going to do that on every corner. Okay. So, i'm going to just  put a nail here. And here to hook my chalk line on. And i can snap two of the lines. So, i can hook my chalk line on that nail. Go all the way to the other end to my corresponding mark. , if you're not familiar with chalk lines, i in fact have a video about that,. But if you need to see it, check it out. Okay. Now, there's a bit of a spot here where it didn't show up. So, we'll just go back. And that. So, we got that line. I'm rolling the chalk line in to get more chalk on it. Hold on. We'll go this way. Pull my line tight on my mark. Snap. Okay,. So we got two lines now. So, i'm just going to rinse. And repeat that on the other two balls. And we will be good. [music] all right. So,. Now we've got that guideline all the way around for the inside of our rim joist,. And we're ready to start laying out joists. Okay. So, we've got our outside perimeter line. , pull out our plans here. Now, your plans are going to specify  any layout that you have. Now, yours are going to be different than mine,. But you know, you're going to have some kind of plan to go by or a plan in your head or whatever you got approved for your permit. Now, in my plan, it's not as simple as just hooking on the end. And pulling the tape. And marking my 16 ft centers. , we've got a floor joist that we want at the edge of the stairs, which is over there. It's running along here. And, , that's kind of our, , important joist in this case. So, we need to find the location of that. And. Then we can kind of work our 16-in centers each way from that. Now, yours may may be  different centers. You may be 24 in. And then one i don't use that often is 19. And 3/16,. But yours could be one of those. My particular one is  16 in on center. So. Now i'm just going to keep this stuff moved down a bit. So on my plan, i've got 92. And 38 from the very outside to the center of that stairwell joist. So let's just hook on here. 92. And 38. It's going to be down here. So that's the center. Okay. So i've i've got my preliminary mark, which is 92. And 38. Now, my  my joists are the cords on them because we're using tji's. The top. And bottom cord is 2. And 1/2 in. So, get to to get to an edge, i need to come back one. And a/4 in from that center mark. So, this is the important one. You got to get the first one right or you're going to be messed up. So, my center mark was here. When i measure back my inch. And a quarter, it's here, which means my joist is on that side. Now, i can measure right from that mark there, 16 in either way,. Now that we've established it,. And mark my joist. So, i'm going to put a nail there. And if i hook on that nail. And come back 16 in every time since. Now we're we've determined that that's the edge. And i want to mark all my x's the way you're looking at them. You'll see them on the right hand side. Okay. So, a lot of people say, ""well,. Now you're not 16 in on center."" well, yes, we are. Even though we're marking the edges from a from an edge, we've measured to an edge. That still works out the same no matter where i put my tape. If i want to measure from the 16in center mark here back to 16 in here, i'm inch. And a quarter from that line. So, it it does it it works out. Some people have trouble grasping that,. But i do have a video dealing with  laying out walls. And that sort of thing. That might might help you a little bit more. But anyways, we've determined our our joist here at the stairwell. And. Now off of that joist, i can mark my 16in centers all the way along. And x on your right hand side. The x indicates which side of that line i want to set my joist on. So, i'm just going to continue on doing the same thing all the way along this wall. Now, you're not going to quite see what i'm doing,. But you got the idea. I'm just marking 16 x on the right. 16 x on the right. Okay. So, we've got those marked out. I can. Now pull this out of here because we don't need it anymore. And i'm going to go over mark the other side. And i'm also going to use this big square. And mark these all just to give myself a nice straight line. Square line. Really not probably 100% necessary,. But it's just what i like to do. Now, hopefully we don't end up in the way of any bolts. So, if you watched my video on installing this ledger, i thought i was purposely placing those bolts. So they were out of the way. But it's not looking like i was very correct on that because i've already got two that are basically hitting that. Okay. Well, we'll deal with that when we're doing the joist. It's not ideal,. But it is what it is at this point. Okay, i'm going to continue on measuring. And marking these all out,. And then we'll come back.

And marking these all out,. And then we'll come back. And talk about the next step. Okay,. So we've got our lines all marked. Everything's laid out. First thing i'm going to do is put a piece of this rim board up here. And nail it in. I'm using hot dip galvanized nails because i'm shooting into pressuret treated lumber. So, be sure if you're shooting into pressuret treated, you're using the right nails. And i'm going to put a nail. I'm going to basically toenail it into the end of this  rim board. About every 6 in is what they recommend. And i'm using 3-in nails. Okay. So, like i said, these are like an engineered rim rim board. That's why it looks like it does. And remember, we snapped that chalk line around the perimeter. So, that's what i'm wanting to line up with. Just about too short to see over that. So, i think i'll go along. And pack it every couple feet. And then  come back. And get it. Okay, i just look in there, make sure we're good. Now, if it pushes in a bit on you, just go back after you've got it all nailed. And tap it out with your hammer. I've got a couple spots where i probably want to tap it back. Okay, just like that. I'm going to grab another one. And go up this end. And. Then i think for today i'm going to start putting some joists in place. So once i have this nailed. And tapped, you know, in or out to my line, i can push the joist up against it. And use my mark down there to mark the joist. And then cut them off my joist. What are they going to be? I think they're 24 footers. So we're going to be cutting off, you know, 2 three inches off each one. So i'm going to get this other piece on here just since i'm in the business. And. Then i'm going to look at the joist. So i can flush this end up, this one to the end of this one because i brought this one right out to the corner. And nail it. So these are in my case i believe 9. And a half. Yep. Yep. 9. And 1/2. So i used five nails there. Obviously if yours are higher you're going to need another nail or two. So same thing. I'm just going to go along here. And nail this to my chalk line. Definitely a little easier where i'm taller or you know standing up on some higher dirt out here. I can see more what's actually going on. Need more nails. There's the nails i'm using. Now, if you're living somewhere where you've got tornadoes, hurricanes, that sort of thing, that sort of weather, this system is going to be a little different for you. You're probably going to have mechanical ties like straps poured into the concrete if you even have a basement,. But into the grade beam, whatever. So, you might have some metal straps that have to come up. And over all this, too,. And get nailed in a specific way. We don't have that type of weather,. So we're not worrying about that. Basically,. So plate is bolted to the foundation. This board here is nailed to that. And the joists are all nailed down. And everything. And around here, we call that good. So, i got those all nailed. I'm going to go along. And bang this in. And out. And. Then i'll look at some joist.

So plate down. , this is the side of the line. Here's the line. This is the side i want the joist on. And we've got a bolt right there. So, not ideal,. But all i can really do is  because this whole bottom plate of this eye joist, there's the eye joist there. This bottom plate is going to be sitting fully on the sill. So, if i drill a hole, i'll use a spade bit or something. Drill a hole in the bottom there corresponding with this,. Then it can just sit right down on it. Shouldn't be an issue. Definitely out in the out in the span, you know, out out away from the sports, you definitely don't want to cut that bottom or top cord. But, , in all my planning, , i think there's three along this one wall that end up right where a joist is. Over on that other wall, i think i had one. So, i'm not sure. I messed up there somehow. So, even though i told you to measure. And be careful, i still screwed it up, too. So,. But here we've got our few joists sitting. And i've got them, you know, tight to the to the rim down here. And we'll go down to this end. Now, if you if you were just going to measure that, you know, from chalk line to chalk line in the width of the basement. And cut all your joist ahead of time, i'd recommend you cut them an eighth inch shorter than whatever it measures. Lumber has a tendency to grow. And we've got lots of bearing here, like lots of surface that the ends are going to sit on. If they're an eighth inch short, not a huge deal. And  that'll just help you keep your rim nice. And straight. So here they are sitting down on this end. Sun's kind of playing with us with shadows here,. But you can see our chalk line. So i'm just going to mark these. I know that they're pushed down there. And sitting. So i'll just mark them a little shorter than the line. And pull them back this way. And cut them all off. Now, i won't go like we want to space them out on the beam out there, too. But i'm not going to go out there. And mark that all out. I'll just  use some spacer blocks. And move those along. And and  fasten those where the spacer block sets them instead of walking around out there using a ladder. And blah blah blah. But you could, if you wanted to, hook from your  chalk line out here. And measure in for each one. Once you get in a couple,. Then just measure your 16s like we did on the on the rest.

So now i've got things set. And cut to length down there. We need to start fastening them. So, basically, every joist is going to get the same nails that i attached the rim with. We're going to get one through the rim into the top cord, one into the bottom cord,. And two angled  one on each side in the bottom cord into the sill plate. And keep them about an inch, those bottom ones, keep them about an inch. And a half, 2 in from the ends just to try to prevent some splitting. Now, we had our all our lines there. Okay. Okay. So, i'm going to look for my line. And i'm also going to add a little bit of construction adhesive just to hopefully prevent any squeaks or anything down the road. So, i'm going to set it in that bead. Make sure i'm on the right side of my line side with the x. Pull it over right nice. And tight with my rim joist. Now, these aren't very tall. You should pretty much be able to eyeball whether they're close to plum or not. I'm just going to put one nail in, one in the bottom,. And then i get my angled ones in here. Okay. So, i'm going to do that on every one. And at both ends when i put that other rim on that end. But i'll get all these ones here attached, glued. And attached to start with.

When you're using the glue, just make sure it's clear of  you know, sawdust. And whatever else down there where you're putting it or it's not going to stick as well. You might have noticed here that there you can see a bit of a lip. The rim is just slightly higher than the floor joist. And i never made any effort to try to bring these up flush. And  it's actually stated in all the  videos. And literature for these types of materials that this is generally going to be proud. And just to go with it that way. Put these down sitting taking the weight down onto the sill. And  something about these have a little bit of compression  to them. So when you get the weight of the house on here supposedly that gives them a little bit of  room to compress if they need to. I don't know. Not sure what your thoughts on are on that,.

And basically all that is is to give a little bit more rigidity to the basement wall. And solid things up. So i'm going to put some blocking in in here. And obviously get some down on the other end, too. And. Then once i get that, i can start putting blocking  in between here, right over top the beam. So, i think that's getting close to what i'm going to show you in this video. It's getting to be pretty long. So,  i think we'll split a couple things up here. I've basically got the joist done up. And over to the  stairwell opening. And i think the next video that will be the  subject is how to deal with the stairwell opening. So with these blocks, they've just spec to use 2x10. So the 2x10 is going to be shorter than any of these other materials,. But that's fine. It's just a spacer is really what it is. So i'm just going to put them in. And put them right down to the bottom. That'll leave a little bit of clearance up top here. So really all i'm going to do is probably put three nails, three, four nails through the rim here,. And then i'm going to fire couple nails, either towen nail them or drive them through here into the into that block. So i'll have my 16in on center, 16in on center,. And stick all the blocks along here. , something else i should mention. [music] , i haven't cut any for it yet,. But i'm going to, if you see here, this is where we've got one of our joints in our in our rim joist. And they don't recommend typically, you know, you would be lining those up on a joist or whatever, right? And. And nailing them on a joist or a piece of blocking. ,. But they don't recommend that for this stuff. So, what they're saying is just take a just take a scab piece. And put it in here. And then just  oops. And just fire some nails into it. And just basically scab those  those joints together. So, that'd be anywhere like we're going to have a joint over here, joint over there. I think these are 12 footers. So, we're going to we'll end up again at the far end 6 ft from the end of the walls. Having another splice like this. So, you can see my see all my nails in the rim there. And you can see how we're not quite flush here. And that's why i was saying snap that line. Just to try to get things straight. Let's just have a look down this rim. See if it see if it looks straight. I haven't really put an eye on it yet. See, when i put this blocking in, that'll fix some of that ooh that's going on down there.

So you can take make a ton of money. Now what i just marked here is my 4t line okay cuz i'm going to be cutting out 4t of drywall. And the reason i'm cutting out 4t of drywall well that's the size of drywall at the store. So i'm going to make my life simple by cutting the the hole the same size as the sheet that i need to buy to cover up the hole when i'm done makes sense. So that's going to be my hole. And i'm going to make it almost the entire 6 ft okay. And i'll tell you why because right. Now i've got my plumbing stack here. And the vent goes up when i change the plumbing. And i have two drains i also need those vents to go up. And then travel across. And reconnect with this venting higher than the sink if it it was full of water to guarantee that i'm always going to have fresh air coming to that drain if i connect too low i can eventually fill up the fresh air venting system with water. And then i'm in a whole heap of trouble. So this is why i'm going all the way up to 4t it makes no difference if you patch a big hole or a small hole it's the same amount of work all right. So just give yourself lots of room to work. And you'll save yourself time in the end. Now i'm going to show you two different techniques for cutting if you have a drywall cutout tool it's a lot faster. But most people don't buy tools specific like that for their diy home projects this is a saw this is like 12 bucks okay. And you can cut drywall with it the secret here is you can also cut your electrical. And your plumbing supply with it. So you want to be really careful you're only cutting with about inch. And a qu inch. And a half all right one of the tips you can do is you can take a black marker. And just mark the blade. So when i'm cutting. And when that black disappears i know i'm going too deep. And then you'll get a fuel for it plumbing electrical code requires that everything is recessed in the wall an inch. And a half okay. So you're not going to accidentally cut things this way or if you don't want to waste all day long with the saw you can buy yourself an ofa knife follow our link in the amazon in the video description. And you can just set this to an inch. And a quar. Now most drywall is only half an inch thick. And you can just pull line through it usually by the second pass you've gone completely through. And don't worry if it takes you three or four it's just experience [music] talking all right this isn't about being perfect this is about getting most of it the first time you'll notice that when you get near the end when you start pulling the drywall apart there's always going to be areas that you don't get cut right because there's screws to the wall just bumped into wall stud there. And it's not going to slow you [music] down. And the other side now catch my breath a bit round your electrical take a pair of pliers or a hammer disengage the drywall around the box. So that everything comes clean all right. And then get the first corner out of the way this is not something where we're trying to save this material okay that'll drive you nuts just want to reach in here shake it. So all the drywall screws pop through the paper. And then they just rip out the other side okay be gentle around your plumbing here we are.

And tea off in both directions. And install the vanity basically where the hole is cut out. Now now that we've worked on the tub. And got that other thing out the water out of the way the room feel. So much bigger it just seems wrong to not center this on the wall. So instead of using this okay. And converting one here. So that we can bring our drain left. And right. And one up here to reconnect the venting i'm going to maintain this system right. Now and i'm going to just cut it here. And bring another drain over to this location all right. And i'm going to be making this the center of my my wall. And the center of my vanity okay. So that means i've got to bring hot. And cold to within 3 in of the drain on each side to fit the back of the vanity. And i've got to run all everything over tee it all off to do it again over there. So i got to open up a little drywall i'm going to unscrew these boxes get them up out of the way because i'm going to do this really simple i'm not going to drill a bunch of holes for the wood simply going to take out my skill saw. And cut my lumber. And notch it out.

So if i go to 2 ft let's see yes one sheet of drywall will fill this hole perfect okay. So let's just get on with it [music]. And the way i draw that line is i'm actually lifting with my knees.

So i can set this over top okay that's a female end. And i need to cut my pipe here in here all right. And then because it's a drain i've got to go that's level. And i'm going to go little bit off level 1° it's almost 2 in wide cuz the inch. And a half refers to the interior dimension okay that's the diameter of the inside of the pipe inch. And a half exterior is almost 2 in. So i can make my life simple. And just put this on that existing line. And make a mark here we go. And then when i cut i'm going to cut on the inside of each of these lines okay that way my pipe will fit in that groove. And the plate that i buy will be big enough to go over top of the hole. Now we also have venting we're going to tie in for venting up here somewhere yeah let's do this nice. And tall. And mark that pipe here same thing only different only this one we're going to have a downward slope. And the reason for that is when you put this pipe on. And you've got this curl there is rain water. And that sort of thing that can work its way into the pipe okay. So if i have an a slope this way it'll actually get trapped in here. And i don't want water sitting in here. So we're going to slope it this way because it can come down. And then it can follow this drain. And then go down there again that made any sense i hope it did. So we're going to go level. And then downward slope okay there we go that was the math not too tricky at all once you see it coming together right okay. So the secret to cutting a pipe is a small reciprocator i would prefer to have a smaller blade even okay what you want to do is you want to hold steady. And then you want to through like crazy. But this close to the stud i've got all kinds of issues i don't want to cut backwards upside down i don't want to go in the other wall. So what am i going to do i'm going to go get my multi-tool i know every 6 months i pull it out for just just a minute. And a half okay. So now i got my multi-tool. And because i'm a genius my power is still engaged whoops genius can't fit in a plug. Now you know i should show you because honestly these are a couple hundred bucks right. And if you're doing a diy project at home. And you're not you don't have tools like this there's another option i'll show you one you go to the hardware store. And you can ask them for a  abs or pvc pipe saw it's a wire saw kind of works like this the wire goes around behind okay. And it's got rings on it it's kind of like from an old movie where someone's sitting in the back seat. But they don't check the back seat when they get in the car. And then the guy leans over. And and he chokes you to death right well the wire saw works like this. And you just hold those rings. And go back. And forth you can slice through a pipe in any situation for six bucks all right. So there's a great diy solution there i used to have one god only knows what happened to it most of my tools end up in the garbage because well my kids work with me. Now we can go have some [music] fun yeah that pipe's got a little bit of flexibility out there nice i got a trick for you there's  a lot of play here. And i don't know why. So what i'm going to do do an old trick that a plumber show me one time when he was doing a  galvanized replacement pipe situation okay. So what he did is he took this the all round strapping that you can buy at the plumbing store okay. And he went like this. And he wrapped the pipe. And you threw a screw into a stud. And what it does is when you cut the next piece of pipe it holds it where it is. So it's not moving around because you don't want to do your plumbing cut your pipe. And have whatever's sitting up top let's say it's a it's teed up. And it goes across the room right it's not supported properly. And then it comes down. And then you go. And do your measurement. Now you've got potentially you've screwed up the slope. And what's going on in the attic you don't don't do that. So strap your pipe connect it to the wall. And then you can [music] go it's like giving a kid a haircut around his ears e there we go. So when you're done this it makes a mess okay. So you're going to want to just take a knife. And cut all of these burs off cuz really a vibration tool like that it doesn't cut as much as it melts. So it's like a buch of candle wax all around the pipe okay. So cut back all these burs inside the pipe as well because this is going to be a drain okay. So we don't want to have that rough stuff sitting there it'll catch all the hair up top it's only vent. So it doesn't really matter be careful with this right pay attention to where the knife's going to,https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=634,"['What type of pipe cutter would you prefer to use for cutting a pipe?', 'Why is it important to cut pipes at an angle when installing a drain?', 'How does a wire saw work and what are its advantages over other types of pipe cutters?', 'What is the purpose of using a strap or clamp to hold a pipe in place while cutting it?', 'Why is it necessary to clean the burs from a pipe after cutting it with a vibration tool?']"

Now what i'm about to do should not be possible because i can't find 1. And 1/2 in abs anywhere in ontario don't know why stores are out all my suppliers are out can't find it. But through the power of me being a hoer i still had a couple of lanks sitting in my shed. And you're damn right i kept that shed locked all all year  building materials if you have something rare they're a real commodity. So i've got this. And i've got a couple of six-footers. So i'm going to be okay to just do all this an inch. And a half which is great if you're stuck. And you want to do this project right. Now and you can't find one. And a half you're allowed to use two in pipe. And fittings okay what you need to do is do this at some point you're going to have to go to inch. And a half in order to do your p traps. And everything else. So you're going to have to scr up a couple inches of this stuff if you open up your wall you might already have 1. And 1/2 in from here going up cut it out switch to two. And use this pipe. So that you can put your stems on for your new p traps okay because you can use a conversion like this from 2 to 1. And a half or you can get a 2in coupler okay. And this is called a bushing. And it's 2in insert. And then one. And 1/2 goes inside of that those are your options okay. So you can convert from 1. And 1 half to two anywhere you need i am using this which is very common in in the building store it's a 2-in drain inch. And a half here. And an inch. And a half here. And the reason for that is is very very common that the drain coming off the sink is also the vent for other things in the room. So a lot of times this is what we'll see okay boom right like this. And this is actually the vent for the shower or a tub or a toilet or something else in the room. So that's why if it's going to be a drain. And a vent it needs to be a 2-in pipe that's why we have it. So if you have to do everything in 2-in pipe. And then just convert. So you can have inch. And a half stems that way you've got the right plumbing you can do that let's call thor. And have them open up the damn plumbing cap if you don't have a cheap pair of $4 wrench you're not getting these open you know i i don't care who you are this this is just tough. Now we're putting in a new floor. So i don't care if i get this all over the place i'm going to try to be careful. But i'm ahead of myself i haven't cut my hole yet w slow down jeffrey slow down let's check our battery power no worries let's check our depth remember my pipe is 2 in i'm not not enough yet let's try that 2 in two. And a4 i like that two. And a qu is good all right. So we're going to cut everything at two. And a quarter hopefully this all works yeah let's see how that works okay. Now on my saw i took my my cut line the zero line. And i put a black marker on it all right it helps make it really easy to identify when you're cutting cuz i got black marker on the wall i got black marker here my life just got really simple i put the black mark on the black,https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=980,"['What type of pipe is commonly used for both drains and vents in a room?', 'Can you use two 1.5-inch pipes instead of one 2-inch pipe for plumbing projects?', 'Why do plumbers often need to convert from 1.5 to 2-inch pipes during a project?', 'How can you identify the vent pipe in a room when it is also used as a drain?', 'What tool is necessary to open and close plumbing caps without damaging them?']"

And easy. And now we got a nice place to run our pipes yep yep perfect time for the glue no mask required all right you want to glue the fitting. And the pipe okay this is not really glue we call it glue it's a solvent. And as such you want to actually melt both the fitting. And the pipe. So then when they meet they meld together [music] did i actually get that just a hair off e dang nab it okay we're going to connect this first okay while we have the luxury of being able to move everything up.

And down. And this is going to be a 19in piece of pipe what i generally do when i'm dealing with this pipe is i'll measure. And cut to a place where i know i'm going to see the printing 19 in is right right between the 28 you haven't seen any of our plumbing videos before this is just  it's a pipe cutter it's only for inch. And a half abs it has a little bit of a tooth on here. So you're going to want to set the middle of the the middle of the fixture where your 19 mark is. And that's right between the two. And the eight twist. And pull. And then that's that easy all right the other advantage of this is it doesn't cause fs it's no melting it actually cuts the pipe. So we got to be a little quick with this again you want to melt the pipe on both ends okay set it time is of the essence. And forget it step one complete we want to come across here to 20 and2 from my center mark that's where i want my drain. So that's going to be long enough that's good okay. So the first thing i want to do is take a marker. And mark the center line on the back of that wall. So 20. And 1/2 this is 17. So i got to go three. And 1/2 okay. So this is my center line all right. So now i got a piece that's going to be long enough i got a center line i have to get my fitting. Now what i'm using is a te okay it's okay to use a te in a wall coming off the off the faucet make sure that the water is flowing in the right direction all right. And it's going to go here it's not just going to go there the center of this pipe is going to go on that center line okay. And we just go. And check wow that's that's basically right off the wood that makes it easy to measure. So i need because i'm going to be here i want to have 3/4 of pipe for inside the fitting 3/4 plus to the inside of this fitting 36. And 1/2 okay 36. And 1/2 is between the f. And the six here's my tool here's my line. And when you cut it you're better to cut it just a hair short all right these fittings if it's in that far. And it's it's square it's still going to work it's better to work until it's right all the way in to get it all the way in actually requires a fair amount of glue once the adhesive is on there or the solvent. Then it works together much better. Now what i'm going to connect here to save a fitting this is called a street 90 okay because this end is big enough for an inch. And a half pipe to go in. And this end is inch. And a half pipe. And so it's a fitting that goes right in the end okay. So i'm going to put these two together before i get started if it's on the floor. So much easier to get that 90° angle right we're going to put that in first okay the thing is is that it's tendency to want to sit low. So now i'm going to take some of this all round strap i'm going to glue that end i'm going to take some strapping. And tie this up nice.

And tie this up nice. And tight to maintain my drain if you're doing a plumbing job go. And buy a coil of this stuff it's five or six bucks  there's. So many uses it's just crazy right you're going to you're going to just thank me cuz sooner or later you're going to run into a situation like oh i wish i had the all round just get it. Now here's how you cut all round they electrical side cutters okay right there that's it done okay. So now we're ready with that i've got a screw here because we're doing that one under pressure we'll do this joint first. Now while it's still setting up that's the time to do this okay put the screw through one piece through another piece don't even worry about it cuz what we're going to do is we're to screw this on an angle okay see that. And that's just going to keep on pulling until we get it set right where we have maximum torque done everything's out of the way okay yers. Now we're good to go okay make sure you got angle straight up if you're not sure stick a piece of pipe in it make sure it's not sticking out like this before the before your solvent sets okay you got a little bit of mercy here you got a few minutes all right. Now we're in the right direction next thing we're going to need 6 in no solvent here just push it in make sure while you're at the store you buy one of these they come in blue as well okay  different plumbers use them for different things for me orange means that it's attached. And blue means that it's not attached. But i have a free one. So i'm going to use it okay it's up to me to remember that that's not glued when i come back later what if i need this to come out just a little bit further for the sink you don't know until you know. So leave it alone test cap it always when you're removing a test cap check to see if the pipe is attached it's just really good habit all right in case you didn't do that joint you'll get everything installed. And and be like oh look at that there's a little bit of water in the bottom of the vending you you think it's a water supply or the taps or something it's just a little drip coming out of here because it's just not quite snug enough without the adhesive i keep calling it adhesive. And if you're in the comments going it's solvent man it's solvent. Then that's fine i guess you know you wouldn't be surprised how many times people have yelled at me in the comments because it's plum not level well i'm canadian okay we're a little weird let's just make sure that this is right you know the old expression everybody says a jack of all trades eh.

Now when i'm doing this i don't have a lot of flexibility here right. So if i put this pipe in. And i glue it there. And then i glue this here see. Now i'm limited i don't really have enough room here to stick them on. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this pipe in. And i'm going to put this pipe in. And then slam it over okay just always think about your installation. And pick the easiest connection to be the last one okay it's not always just come all the way back to here maybe there's not a lot of flexibility just look for the opportunity to say that's the easiest connection yeah this the best advice i can give you you're on your own you got to figure it out because this is venting we can use these  sharp 90s okay cuz it's mostly air if this was drain pipe cuz we only have drain from here down this is drain. But a sweeping tea is okay you're supposed to go with really big 90s. Now world has changed really big 90s. So if you're getting your plumbing inspected make sure you put in big sweeping 90s or 245s or they will give you some serious heck. And make you do it all over again it's kind of funny you know cuz back when plumbing first started there was code there was rules. And then  the rule was inch. And a quarter pipe for a drain galvanized yeah crazy. Then they found out after i don't know you know 30 40 50 years wow this really doesn't work anymore the drain stopped functioning because of all the corrosion. And the fact that the water supply in people's homes was cast iron water supply. So then they changed everything they got new building materials. And they changed the code. And then since. Then they've changed the code. And made. So many modifications bottom line is when it comes to plumbing  the longer it sits in a wall the less it'll work for you there's no escape you're going to run into problems. So if you're still following  1970 or 1980 building code. And you're not getting inspected that's between you. And god. But truth is most of the latest upgrades unless you're getting inspected aren't necessary to even follow you didn't hear that from me here we go 17 3/4. And a double check looks good to me i'm going to go to 18 do i got a piece that's still 18 in there we go folks the last piece of abs pipe left in the city of ottawa i'm taking 18 in of it it's almost painful to watch it's like eating an endangered species for dinner here we go call me if you want them [laughter] okay can the world just go back to work please again we're going to be quick here before everything sets up ah all right. And snug is a bug. And a rug hurah okay there's our waist. And our venting finished. And tied in we're. Now done with the good stuff okay don't do that at home kids all right here we go. Now remember earlier i mentioned if you need to you can go with 2in pipe everywhere the danger of that is is that 2in pipe is actually 2. And 1/2 in. So you lose a lot of space. So you got to really pick your battles as to where you're going to put your water lines  the challenge with notching in the front is. Now my water lines got to go on the backs side. But i can't put metal plates back there. So i really got to be careful careful not to go too deep. And there we go check this out slow speed middle speed. And in high speeded pretty cool huh i showed you that in case you only have  the finances to buy one drill right. Now that's the one to get we did a video where i showed the differences. And all the flexibility of the impact driver.

And i don't want to have to add the drilling holes in the cabinet cuz it just looks cheesy right rather have all the holes coming through the drywall nice. And clean come through that little slice that they've got built out. So take the time to always measure off your cabinet don't just assume yeah we'll set it at 18 or 20. And then within a few inches take your time this is important. Now h have to tea off. And this is why you always open it up on day one make a list of everything you're going to need. And then go shopping. And buy a couple of extra of everything because you can always take them back right  when you're doing plumbing feel free buy couplings get a couple couplings of every pipe size you're working with all right if you mess up a measurement. And you don't have enough pipe to finish you can always use a couple couplings to cut a pipe stick it on stretch it out a little bit all right or make an adjustment. And you can add two small pieces together with a coupling to make it work. So these are like these are gold because they're like 69 they can save you an hour long trip back. And around to the store. And that'll cost you like 10 bucks in gas. So while you're at the store spend the 69 cents. And have it on hand. Now going to get our solid copper rings. And then want to te this way here i'm going to feed this through from the backs side with the pipe already crimped on. And then i'm going to roll it. And then i'm going to cut it. And then i'm going to attach it. And then i'm going to grab a  a stub out here again we're going to go find my tools about 8 in 8 in just seems to be the perfect depth whenever you're doing a stubo guys all right. Now with pecs of course leave your quarter inch while we're at it as well put on our cap okay this is going to be the biggest challenge of the day getting this pipe in that hole there we go down over. And out okay step one i it's nice to have a rule if you're going to put the fitting in. Then crimp it right don't start moving forward until you've dealt with cuz there's really visually it's very difficult to identify a crimped ring or non- crimped ring until the water's on that's the wrong time to find out. So if you put it on crimp it 8 in st out here we'll stick that on okay there we have it water supply for our first sink within 3 in of the center line no problem right if you're worried about the location of it  you can always grab a little bit of string. And just tie them closer together okay. And then when we come along with our drywall we'll have it locked in place. So then you can rotozip all three holes slide it over nice. And clean. Now this is going to be the tricky one all right. So it turns out the best thing for me to do is actually drill new holes. And then just bring it across up. And out. And i'm going to use this special fitting here to bend the pipe if you got to make a turn you want it supported for the pipe will break okay. So let me demonstrate you just bend it across the metal. And it locks in. And this piece here this bridge keeps it from crimping it won't bend in half. And kill your water supply okay they're like 89 cents if you're going to do plumbing get them all right worth their weight. And gold. So in this scenario i'm just going to connect it. And then i'm just going to drill new holes that's the easiest way for me to just move forward anything else is just going to be a thousand fittings. And i'm not in the mood for a thousand fittings fantastic all right. Now just going to let you know i'm finished my running through i'm going to do a water pressure test. Now cuz you want to make sure you test your line before you close it up there is a special tool  it's a gauge you can buy. And you can go around. And set it on every one of these crimps. And make sure that it's been crimped that's how you tell the difference i don't have the tool on me i got it with the package i've never used it like i said i got a rule if i touch it i crimp it right. So i know some guys will do the whole thing. And put it all together. And then they'll come by. And crimp at all. But that's not me  i'm happy just to do water test i'm feeling pretty confident about this. And it's a lot more exhilarating to do a water pressure test if you're not sure if you got it all crimped all right there we go let's just run through this again i got a drain hot. And cold within 3 in okay that drain is higher. But this one is actually a couple inches lower than normal it's 20 in is normal this one is at 21 which is a little above normal. So what i do is this the p trap for this drain i'm going to use this color attachment all right. So this is a 1. And a qu interior for sinks. And this fitting sits right in the bottom of that p trap all right that is a perfect way to get  drain assembled if you're a little bit high if you're a little bit low same thing over here okay. But this one is an exterior pipe dimension. So then you cut the piece of pipe to fit there you go that's all we need to know. So you can buy the male or the female version of that same fitting. And then when you thread it on the pipe it gets nice. And snug. And water tighten pressure test all right here we go okay max are there any drips forming anywhere nope no any hissing nope okay i'm going to go full blast we're good perfect every time. And we're back okay. So for everybody who  wants to see me do a pressure test well it's pressurized what i do is i just give max a call on my phone. And he just visually inspects this while i turn on the water we wait about 10 to 15 seconds to pressurize the lines in the house we're good to go. And like i said with this kind of crimp if it's not leaking. Now it never will okay there's no question there's only one kind of pressure full on. So now we don't have any concern because there's no degradation in that seal you can even freeze that that. And it'll maintain its seal it's a miracle. So i love this stuff all right guys there we go okay.

So i love this stuff all right guys there we go okay. So now that i got the drywall on just want to mention real quick if you want to learn tips. And tricks for doing drywall in weird situations. And creative solutions to problems we'll put a link in the video description. And the card over here  it's one of our top videos guys okay millions of people have viewed it. And love it. And there's lots of great information there. So if you haven't seen it check it out will you're just going to move ahead. Now it's time to grab the vanity. And get it in place okay we want to actually set it in position. And then from there we're going to be able to get perfect measurements for where all of our lights. And our mirrors are going to go. And we can sort out all of that information with the studf finder come up with a plan. And then i got to drill some holes fix the wiring over here shouldn't be too big a deal cool okay good. And and set it down this went by a lot easier than i thought nice okay. Now we're going to bunny hoop it over about a foot. And a half. Now you see the holes in the plumbing for the walls looks dead center already. So what's say 71 352 if anything i'm a 16th off yeah done all right you only thing we're going to have a problem here matt is  there's a really bad slope on the floor mhm. So let's get the level in here we'll see how much of a slope we have overall okay can you lift that end put that much a little bit more keep going until this levels out look at that we're looking an inch. And a quarter we'll set it right on the right on the head [music] okay i wish life was always this this simple okay all right my [laughter] okay can you drop the  foot pedal on that corner i'm just trying to figure out which way is the right way that is the right way okay there we go we're back to level again okay that's i [music],https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=2496,"['What type of material was being discussed in this video?', 'How did the creator feel about using drywall in weird situations?', 'What tool was used to find studs in the wall?', 'Why did the creator mention a specific link in the video description?', 'What problem did the creator encounter with the floor slope?']"

Now we got to go get the sink countertop set that in place because if you're like me you're visual person. And it's a lot easier for me to map out what to do here with my mirrors. And my lights. And what how i'm going to fix the wiring tomorrow once i've got the countertop in place right besides i somewhere to put my tools yep. And then. Then we'll worry about rolling it down afterwards okay mhm all right we're going to use the shims to help us set it down. And then manipulate it okay. So up into the more of the middle that's good watch your hand it's in a lousy spot get the shim on the outside corner can you hold the  the tilt well if you move the shim i'll lift it okay. Now this thing should roll pretty good even if we're just off the front okay if you know what i mean. So there is about a half an inch overhang on each side we can lift a little bit come to you y okay okay. Now you you can see that yeah. Now come right flush to the front yep okay. Now we should be able to just roll it in no put your hand inside the sink. And then fingertips on the outside corner yeah i got it yeah i'm here on the on the right side yeah not on the back okay oh you know what hold on lift the back up i'm going to get you can hold it this yeah okay there's a lip inside the sink yeah i'm right it's going to squeeze out nice. And easy. Now take the shim in the middle please my end take the shim on your end okay. So i am4 to 316 yeah that's perfect. Now it's perfect okay this is a 72in countertop 36 nice what do you think i think we did a good job i think it works i think there's room to stand here. And open the drawers i got three drawers downstairs let's just get them in okay  less things land around on the floor the better okay. So once you bring your vanity up guys the before you put your countert up on make sure you level it all off right. So corner to corner back front going in three different directions with a shoulder level this way there's a lot of different ways you can balance this in. And depending on your floor. And your conditions in your home you might even have to cut the feet like i did all right. So that's fine do what you got to do. But make sure that the the the place that people see the most prominent corner looks the best. And then make all your adjustments everywhere else if you need to leveling feet cutting the legs whatever you got to do. But you want this to be level. And you want it to be flushed to the wall you don't want to have a gap opening up okay. And then we're in a great position. Now i can get my laser line out. And i can draw a laser line off my sink faucets. And draw my center lines for my mirrors. And then i have a line that i can measure from to open up the wall. And move my electrical room going to be a piece of cake all right guys. So what i'm doing is i'm drawing a laser line here i want to have it going through the center of the hole. And through the center of the drain because this is 8 in off off the wall if it's center on these two points it's going up this wall center i'm not going to have any issues right. So i'm just going to go like this. And like this turn this off before i go blind for the purpose of helping you all out i'm going to be left-handed for two seconds okay we're going to put a big c on that that's your mark. So you can measure off this line left to right in every direction draw laser lines anywhere you need this is going to be the center of the mirror right. And while we're at it i'll show you the fixtures okay. Now you can see this mirror has got these little clips. And so i need to have two positions for the screws right it's going to be interesting okay guys. So because not everybody's going to be interested in mirrors. And lights. And all that sort of stuff we're going to make that a separate video okay we're going to add that in you can watch all that next week right. Now let's go get into into the  connecting of all the plumbing we'll drop in the faucets. And the sinks. And we'll get all that hooked up. And check the water do that last water test. So then you know that at least you got your water taken care of. And you're not going to have any leaks.

But if you saw us put that in can you imagine having two sets of taps. And faucets. And water supply lines on a 6t vanity that's already a couple hundred lbs. And try not to screw that up really difficult right. So it's i always prefer to be  uncomfortable when i'm doing my plumbing than take a risk of damaging everything while i'm trying to save a step anyway  turn off the water drain the lines we're going to do the water supply first. Then we're going to attach all the faucets. And then when that's done. Then we're going to connect all the drain okay you don't want to have the drain installed. And then be crawling up there upside down trying to tighten the faucet connections that'll drive you crazy. So do this in the right order. And it makes it simple first thing of course is we've drained the lines for a few minutes. Now we are going to squeeze. And turn. And there's always a little bit of water god help us all the more patient you are with draining your lines the less pressure will be in the system yeah that one's had more time to drain well. Now that that's out of the way i'm going to show you the easiest diy plumbing shut off valve system on the market i love this for a couple of reasons one it's just push connect shark bite shut off two it's just a 90° turn that's open when it's in line. And that's closed we don't need this cap. And now i'm going to go the phone. And be right back these shut off valves also come in 90. So you can have it come out in the water supply comes up. And then shut off fs on the front where i went shopping they were out of inventory i'll tell you right. Now ever since the storms in texas last year companies like sharkbite have had a horrible time keeping their stuff in inventory starting to get a little closer to normal. But sometimes you're just going to have to be flexible you're going to find the water supply r the water supply lines on the rebell pro faa that i bought are like 20 to 24 in. So they'll have no problem coming down. And looping back in at a later date if i get a chance i might change it to ' 90s. But for. Now it's just nice to get it finished. So we're going to start off with these things in the clos position get rid of the decorative caps. And we simply are going to press. And twist all right you want to get about 1 in on this pipe back. So do yourself a favor. And set your thumb about an inch or. So back. So you know when you're almost there cuz that's not on okay this is on there you go all right. Now i know i'm installed that pipe got collapsed a little bit when i cut it it's a little oval you don't want to try to force the sh shark bite on there like that make sure it's nice. And round if you want to make sure grab one of your solid copper rings. And slide it on that. And if it goes on without any difficulty. Then you're okay okay if you're fighting with it to get it on you're going to fight with the shark b. And you might cause damage to the fitting. And then it won't work get that on there here we go okay. So for ease of operation i'm right-handed i'm going to leave the shut off valves on the right okay there we go that's set up woohoo. Now we get to go. And assemble the faucets all right guys. So here's an 8 in faucet set give you an idea how it works you're going to have a water supply line. And then a redirect back to the the tap that comes out okay all right. And these are all deck mounted just a note when when my wife bought this vanity it was kind of like a hey honey i need this big this dimension two syn whatever i forgot to say if you can find one that has a countertop that has single hole all right. Then the faucets are really affordable when she went on the way for her site majority of these countertops had three holes drilled in it i don't know why the cabinet encounter people are in cahoots with the plumbing industry. But it takes three times as much effort to drill through three holes as it does to do one okay. And guaranteed any faucet you buy you can put on this counter because they do make single hole faucets that have the huge plate right. But who wants a huge plate if it was only one hole you could get a single hole faucet as it is this is three times the price. And i had two of them i'm. So blessed. So where to the wise when you're shopping if you're worried about your budget get a single hole for your sink anyway this is a great demonstration how to hook up a sink because you get a whole lot more knowledge there's a lot of parts a lot of assembly okay most of it is actually a lot simpler than it looks all right  we're just going to go through this we don't need these i've done these faucets a thousand times i've been using reell pro for 15 years maybe 12 god it feels like forever max it feels like forever. So let's just go through all the parts we'll just kind of like  install them from the top first okay okay that's your water supply line i was talking about right that's going to have no problem connecting to that shut off valve down there. Now before we can drop it in the hole we need something to keep it from falling all the way through just a word of warning when you're undoing your packaging see these little here these little chrome stoppers they're in a separate bag it's not garbage don't throw that out they go in here afterwards okay what you're going to do is you're going to take each one of these water supplies we're going to throw this over top okay. And it's going to thread go backwards there you go till it makes a click noise spin it down a little bit get out of the way. Now on this you're going to see the little flat section okay that goes on the top all right. And you're going to thread that down until it doesn't thread anymore just fingertight nice. And easy okay that's your stop. Now you can adjust this over time. But you want to have contact here. And i'll show you why okay here's your handle. And it just sits right on right in that boom okay this space here is what guarantees no rubbing all right if you don't sink it down far enough. And then you install it you actually make contact with the ring. And you're going to get grinding. And noises you don't want that okay. So fingertight all until it stops. And then back this plate up to it. Now you're ready to install it okay make sure this gasket is in its rightful position. And is there anything on this about left. And right or hot. And cold yes these are marked is. So this is hot line okay. And the reason you want to have this all marked is because these faucets will open. And close counter like in different directions if you put them on the wrong side they'll still function. But then your taps will look weird okay get these. And that sits here boom well that's pretty much installed same thing from over here. Now let's put the bottom on the reason the flat section you want it top. So if you ever have to do maintenance on this or replace it you can put your pliers. And grab the flat spot. And you can loosen off that connection after it's been there for a while trust me you're going to need the pliers okay it only works great out of the box there we go. Now that one's ready to go in that's the cold supply. Now the next stage is we do from underneath the rubber gasket it's like like a hat it's got a ridge on the top all right that's designed to go into this hole that's it's a universal hole okay. So it goes into the hole in the granite. And sits flush this is perfect all the countertop people are making the same size hole out there okay. So we take that it goes underneath the counter this gets up. And then we thread this on from underneath. And when you do this you want to back off the screws here a little bit okay this will thread up from underneath. And then you'll have this connection here. Then you take a drill with a drill bit. And you can tighten this. And it creates compression against the thread on here. And the countertop. And that's what keeps the handle from moving around okay. So make sure you get the right screwdriver bit. And make sure you give yourself lots of room here to create that compression. Now i got to crawl underneath. And get this done. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to install it upside down in the counter. So you can see easily all right you take your washer with the with the top of the hat pointing the countertop okay. Now there we go that just starts to make a lot more sense. Now doesn't it if you don't see the assembly it's going to be difficult. Now the same thing well that sticker sure is in the way huh okay same thing go backwards until it sits in the in the groove you don't want to risk cross threading this because if it's cross threaded you're done right. Now you've made good contact i could tighten it up a little bit more. But i want to have the screws on each side because that's really easy for me to get a hold of with my drill grab yourself a 6-in drill bit okay cuz when you're underneath the it's really easy to just go like this okay you see how much that moved it's a fine thread it's like an 832 make you good torque or two on there okay. Now that's not going anywhere. Now that's exactly what i'm going to do put from underneath on my back. Now that we've got that set up this is a recap this is a quick connect okay. So this just pops in there. And then the two shorter lines just pop in here. Now your water supply is connected to your,https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=2953,"['What is the recommended order for installing plumbing components?', 'How does the SharkBite shut-off valve system work?', 'Why is it important to drain the water supply lines before starting a DIY plumbing project?', 'What are the benefits of using single-hole faucets on countertops?', 'How do you properly assemble and install faucet components?']"

Now your water supply is connected to your faucet that's the easy part we have this lovely little fitting here as well. And this is set up. So that it could swivel if you want or you can set it up with the washer nut system from underneath all right. And set it in place which is what i'm going to do should just sit there going to crawl down one more time. And i'm going to take my tiny little wrench with me  they make little plastic wrenches for plumbers right sometimes you can buy it has a kit. And it'll just be a little plastic gray thing that comes in there. And you can just throw a screwdriver. And make a wrench out of it it's not really needed i'm going to crawl under here. And connect that. And then connect the water supply  yeah i'm getting too old for this scrap max here we go just right on the shoulder blades is nice cuz if this was particle board i'd probably destroy it cuz i'm a little bit overweight if you didn't notice okay here we go just like the other one rubber gasket first. Then the brass plate. Now i can look up through the drain hole. And see the faucet. And kind of guess what square is is this is a great time to have somebody working with you you can have them up there holding the faucet while you tighten the ring ring on you can see why you don't want to have your p trap. And everything installed right. Now right cuz everything will be in the way. So very important to do this in the right order all right one of the benefits if you're working [applause] alone intentionally have it out i've squared just a little bit when i'm done tightening this on. And i go back up. And i i i straighten that out it'll be enough force to scrap screen that out that i'll be comfortable it's not ever moving again okay i think i'm good with that all of the water supplies okay. So cold line in one side just snap it in as far as it goes hot together you see everything moves freely okay. Now we're just going to go press it up right into the old there we go woohoo the secret here is make sure everything is nice. And looped. And not kinking next thing of course before we do the p trap let's get these water supply lines on these are standard 3/8 water supply it's the same everywhere you go whenever you buy  shut offs they come in 3/8 threaded or they come in/ qu in threaded okay. And qu ines for fridge lines 38 is for anything to do with your faucet in the bathroom. So make sure you get the right one once you finger tightened it always take a little wrench with you okay grab it. And give it at least another good quarter turn fingertight means you've engaged the little washer in here. And it is little okay. Now if you've got lots of line. And you want it to go like this what you can do is you can actually loop it in some cases like this. And then add a twist tie to it keep it out of the way okay i'm not going to worry about that for. Now i think in this particular situation i'm more likely to go out. And get the different shut off valves later. But i'm going to deal with it for. Now because well it ain't no big deal to change a shut off valve there we go. So see that i can i can kind of twist everything out of the way i can put a twist tie on that if i need to to get it out of the way no big deal for. Now okay. But right. Now we're going to deal with this remember when we did the drain we said we're not going to glue that this is why next step is the drain assembly. Now you'll see this it's the same thing everything has a nut in a washer right here we go this is r for down here this is all to be assembled after the fact. And this is how it works this goes into the bottom of the sink like that this is a teflon ring that goes in between the metal. And the rubber because these these the thread on the pipe is not level it's on an angle. And so when you put all this together when you're tightening this up really hard you'll have one point of contact that has the most pressure. And then it's reduced on both sides okay it's on an angle. And if i just go without that teflon right up against the rubber what happens it'll grab it. And it'll go. And it'll pinch. And then you'll have a leak. So this is just to help make sure that there's no no grab it's. So slippery that you can put an incredible amount of tension that even though it's on an angle it'll be tight all the way around okay. And it won't kink on you. So make sure you put that assembly properly one. Then two. Then three all right  one of the reason reason i love reell pro is because they always have a gasket on their drains you don't have to make your own out of plumers putty okay this is set up for a typical sink that has an overflow on it right. So that the the drain is the drain is going to connect it about this level. And there's a huge gap here for the overflowing in the sink to to operate drop that in place. And the plumbing up top is finished. And we'll just slide all three of these components on till we get to the brass ring. And then we just crank it over there. Now i've already got a good seal here. But it's still wiggling around right that's what i was talking about that whole one point of contact. So i'm going to just use my crescent wrench you bugger it's not g to get big enough seriously stupid all right sorry crescent i can't give you compliments on that wrench all right i'm going to just take my little wrench here. And we're going to just work this around a little bit you can see how it's really almost closed here. But bigger on the gap on this side we're just going to keep on doing this until we have solid contact all the way around okay. Now my gasket got solid contact with both sides of the sink i know i'm going to be good for our plumbing we have an abs system here okay here's our p trap it's standard for a sink because it has a drain on it okay. So if you ever lose a ring or something you can just open the drain put a bucket underneath to grab it. And you can drain it all out okay. And it has this release as well. Now it sits in here like this if you ever get leaks where you get rotted out stem here on your old sink  if you get hair clogs it'll cause the metal to rust out real prematurely you can actually disconnect. And then just get a new p trap. And then reconnect it okay just a little something there to help people out all right wrap the threads again plumbing on plumbing plastic on plastic you run the risk okay of a bad joint. And so this is less of a a lubrication. And this more of a sealant take the time to add it okay we're going straight front. And back. So we'll set it up like that really lightly at this point okay there nothing worse than when you do new plumbing to have a customer call you back how is in that warranty department for that renovation company for a while couldn't believe how many times get warranty for plumbing plumbing plumbing plumbing i think the plumber they were using was just really big contract company they're always just cutting corners to get things done because they only gave a 30-day warranty of course the renovation company had a twoyear warranty. So we did nothing. But plumbing repairs all the time all right. Now when not i'm going to check the back here where that pipe is you see the height that that's sitting at okay if i bring that out. And i add this right. Now i'm still too low. So now we're just going to walk,https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=3550,"['What type of wrench is recommended for plumbers?', 'How do you prevent kinking in water supply lines?', 'What is the purpose of a Teflon ring in a drain assembly?', 'Why is it important to tighten the washer nut system from underneath?', ""What happens if you don't use a twist tie to keep water supply lines organized?""]"

Now i'm still too low. So now we're just going to walk through real quick the assembly that you're going to need to connect these drains if you do it in the right order it makes it really simple first thing you want to do put your your p trap here okay where the bottom is. And imagine this is glued to the very bottom of it all right if i go like this because i want to have this stem somewhere in closer to the bottom here okay i don't want to have it just barely making contact with the top if i go where i want it the back of the p trap is higher than the drain okay it's higher than that connection. So now i know that i'm going to have a piece of pipe added in here the only way that we can measure that is really simple we'll just start from the front. And we'll work our way to the back this has a washer ring okay. And then this part threads over top. And creates compression. And when it's loose it can't grab the pipe okay. But when you tighten it on it creates a really good seal. So it's not moving that is what we want. So we're going to rough tomate here just going to use the existing pipe stick it in the back dry fit no glue. And i'm going to go i would like this seal up here somewhere this is really nice for me. So now i'm going to measure down to my. And i'm going to cut the pipe that goes about 3/4 of the way inside each fitting okay. So we'll go like this. And i think three. And a half is plenty okay you know me when i'm measuring pipe i always go on the printed side 3. And 1/2 is at the u to the d on there we go okay remember this fitting this pipe cutter here the melt the join line here this here that's my that's where it's going to cut. So i put it right on that u to the d. And then i stab it. And then i twist it i got a perfect cut nice. And clean okay. So that gives me that assembly. And now we'll take this out of the wall get rid of this temporary loosen this off. Now we're going to glue all of this together okay. So you want to glue the fitting. And the pipe. And i'll tell you why we use the word glue here. But this is a solvent. So basically it's melting the two pieces right. Now and when i stick them together. Then they will when the solvent stops acting. And and reacting it takes about 30 seconds it'll just be an instant sealed bond okay. And it's guaranteed never to leak as long as you're working with everything clean. And new. And you put the solvent on both pieces i know lots of guys out there who only put solvent on one side there we go little bit of a twist just to make sure everything's activated good to go. Now that's ready okay. Now now we can put this back on okay. And now we can measure from inside the back fitting right from there okay up to this point right here okay about about 3/4 again all right. Now this is going to get a little off w. And the fitting to there is 4. And 1 half all right let's see if maybe that'll work well that one's five that's just too close to be able to do that 4. And a2 just to the d line it up stab. And twist. Now the reason i didn't cut it on that piece is i'm only taking a/ an inch off it's really hard for this thing to do a good job with half an inch okay just experience. So that's why i grabbed the new piece okay. Now this is where this gets interesting because we're going to glue this fitting that fitting both ends of this pipe at the same time. And connect it all. And the way we do that is you just loosen this collar up a little bit okay. So there's flexibility all right here we go okay i'm going start in the back give that a run give this a run get a little more both ends of the pipe oh got my finger that's nasty okay we're going to stick it in here. And then i'm going to go like this. And to lift it up into position exactly where i want it. And then i'm going to just give it a bit of a lift. And then i'm going to twist this tight. Now i'm going to tighten this color hand tight again okay don't want to go grabbing a wrench or anything remember remember what i said if you put too much torque on a plastic thread you cause it to go from round to oval. And that's when they leak here we gooo. So now that i have the drain connected i'm going to open up my cold water line i have no idea knowing if the taps are open or closed at this point. And good for them they shipped it closed. Now i can just okay. So now we know these taps are going to going to install that way okay. And then to turn them on you forward there's going to be a lot of water in this all right. Now there's two stages to testing your drain assembly one is just run in cold water all right by itself with the sink open. And you just go about 30 seconds get a good flow going basically what we're doing is we're filling up the peet trap causing water. And if there's any gaps or leaks the water will work its way through all the cracks. And then it'll start to drip. So this can take a couple of minutes all right. And that'll test this joint this joint the glue joints here all right. But it won't test the collar cuz this is higher than the rest of the drain. So okay the way you test the collar is you have to fill the sink up with water all right. So i plug the sink. And then once your sink is full. Then you can just unplug it. And it be such a large volume of water right away if this is not tight. Then it'll. Then it'll leak oh. And that's just running really smooth. Now when you're doing your own plumbing at home the amount of time i just did the leak test is no good it's not acceptable for abs plumbing okay because we have threaded fittings. And compressions what i suggest is leave the cold water running on this bad boy grab a couple paper towels sticking underneath. And if anything drips it'll show up real easy let it go 10 or 15 minutes all right give it a good test cuz if there's just a little hairline where the water can work through it can take quite a while before it shows up. And in most cases a little leak like that will you just got to give it a little bit of little bit of a twist to tighten it up okay or it'll seal itself just because of all the debris in the water supply system okay there we go,https://youtu.be/OQjxCb7wP6U?t=4078,"['What is the purpose of the p trap in plumbing?', 'How do you measure and cut pipe for assembly?', 'What type of solvent is used to glue fittings together?', 'Why is it important to test a drain assembly with cold water?', 'What happens if a threaded fitting is not tightened properly?']"

Now let's finish off the handles up to all right i'm going to show you a little secret here watch this handle that's where you want it right down near the bottom okay this one it's not going all the way down it's because i haven't adjusted the set screw in here yet. Now i got my precision tool kit here i know that it's a 2 1/2 mm or is it there it is you have to open the set screw up. So you can see the blue till you see that blue there okay okay. And that's like a thread sealer. And then you know. Now it drops all the way down okay. And then you stick your precision tool in there. And you tighten up that thread once you have it in place okay. Now this handle is just a little bit off i want it here. So now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back underneath the sink i'm going to use the long drill bit i'm going to loosen those two screws. And i'm going to turn the tower just a little hair. And then tighten them up again that'll square it all off that's exactly where i want it. And then tighten them back up again. And that is why it's made that way okay you can have it perfect every time all right there we go only thing left of course if you found the package. And you didn't throw it out decorative caps okay. And they just slide in underneath. And it goes in like this guys. Now it's just like not compression right. Now if you need to get access to this handle in the future you grab your of knife okay you get underneath here. And you can go like this. And just pry it out of there okay there we go tada. Now you just got to do that twice. So obviously this is a beautiful project the entire bathroom renovation or remodel as we're calling it is going to be up online in just a few weeks you want to watch to see i have a video coming up guys how to put in the mirrors.

And i'm headed to brunswick maine to visit steve. And mercy norman [music] good morning mercy good morning hey steve good morning oh well i had a wonderful night's sleep oh good. And this coffee cake is fantastic i'm glad you're enjoying it. So what are we going to do today well today we're going to head up mercy. And steve explained that most of the interior woodwork at the end is quite detailed reflecting the elegance. And style typical of the larger 19th century homes in town. But one room most likely the housekeeper's quarters in earlier times has trim that is painfully plain by comparison instead of replacing it mercy. And steve have come up with another idea the idea i think is to try to not tear off not to remove the existing. But to build upon that using these standard pieces. And just adding to it. And that that little bit of detail is making a big difference yeah yeah okay listen why don't we do this why don't we put some of this on the baseboard. And around the door casings. And just see how that looks. And where we want to go from there sounds good perhaps the most important part of any molding job is accurate measuring two important tips here one make sure you're at eye level when reading the tape measure fifteen sixteenths. And two it's always better to be a little long than short you can always cut a bit more off seven oh we set up shop in a nearby room it was until recently their son's bedroom. Now steve you know this. But mercy this is  let me just go over what a miter cut is it's actually is an angled cut usually on the end of a piece of wood. And most of the miters that we're going to be cutting today will form an angle of 90 degrees this is the kind of miter that we're going to be working with today. So let's start by taking one piece one long piece of molding right here,https://youtu.be/QLlZ5yd-gas?t=0,"['What type of woodwork can be found in 19th century homes in Brunswick, Maine?', 'Why is it important to measure accurately when doing a molding job?', 'What is the purpose of a miter cut in woodworking?', 'How do you determine if a piece of molding needs to be cut at an angle?', 'What happens if you cut a piece of molding too short?']"

And cutting a 45 degree miter on one end there you go okay okay mercy you want to do this just press that down onto the table back toward the fence with the left hand go ahead. And make your cut [applause] good. Now this piece of molding is going to have a miter cut on both ends of it whenever that's the case we want to cut the miter on one end first. And then measure from that to the location of the second miter here's a tip for a more exact measurement instead of using the hook at the end of the tape measure try placing the one inch mark at the edge of the wood just make sure to add that inch back again at the other end our measurement is 79.

And easily especially in an old home like this where pounding on a wall with a hammer can cause cracking. And damage fragile plaster although with proper eye protection a nail gun is perfectly safe there is a back blast of air. And sometimes it can be a surprise a few more nails. And mercy uses the gun like a champ well this looks good what do you guys think it gives it more depth is that enough no i think it needs something i think  i think if we if we added another piece of trim on the face of the flat part here came down that would start to give it that build up effect that we're looking for okay a little more thickness a little more detail. So then that would run where all the way down to the carpet. But i don't think it should end at the floor it seems like it should stop before that she's right normally this would would stop on a block down here sure like a plymouth block that kind of used on a mantel right exactly a plinth block is a decorative piece of wood work that can simulate the base of a column when it's used at the bottom of a door or as part of a fireplace surround that looks good that looks good i'm just wondering though if we couldn't maybe put some kind of detail on the face of this maybe make it up with some some of the molding that we've got a little crazy would you like that yeah that would be good all right let's try it let's try it.

And today we're going to do one of the most asked about videos of all time how can i move my laundry from one part of the house to the next what's the process for all of the mechanical hookups. And electrical requirements the plumbing requirements we're going to tackle all that today we're going to show you step by step running your new dryer your new washer. And getting all of the permits approved stay with us. And this is a process you want to do whenever you're doing any renovation do your heating. And air conditioning systems your ductwork. And you work your way down from the things that are the largest. And least flexible to the most flexible. So we go from mechanical to plumbing waste drain vent systems water supply. And then our electrical. And you try to think. And from the beginning. And always leave yourself room to run the next system. So in this case our dryer is going to be here my washer will be here. But the blocking in this wall prevents me from installing my washer box directly behind the unit that's okay because the washers come with really long 30 inch flexible extendable hoses. So we're going to put our washer box over here which is convenient for our water supply. And in our situation convenient for drain. And venting too because we're going to be using a santa flo system. So it's going to be a little pump down here on the ground that all the waste water from our shower. And our laundry goes to. And then it's going to pump it up. And out okay. So let's get this installed. Then we'll connect the saniflow piping into the ceiling to our existing venting okay that'll be working perfectly. Now if you've never worked with a washer box before they're quite simple the cap pops off this is. Now your rough in box. And so they have these little tabs on the side. And you slide these in. And these are for mounting the box this is the finished trim. So after you're done all your drywall work you. Then snap this on over top to get a finished look okay. So put this somewhere safe in the meantime. Now there's all kinds of knockouts in here there's a knockout right here for an inch. And a half pipe we'll use that for our drain for our washer we're going to stick this bad boy somewhere up here against this wood. So that i keep it from rattling around give it a little bit of strength. And i'm just going to use some one inch number eight screws to mount the box with the flange [music]. And that is as easy as it gets. Now that no that might seem a little bit flimsy. But keep in mind once we install our drywall. And cut out the hole. And connect all of our plumbing it's not going anywhere if you are concerned about it once you get your abs pipe in here feel free to take some all-around strapping. And just attach it to each side. And hold it to the back wall nice. And tight. And you can get a good compression that way that way when you're working your fittings you can open. And close your plumbing without it swapping around right piece of cake. So the reason i set it up against the framing is that i can knock out the drain there we go. And that just finds the weak spot. And peels open. Now that one. And a half inch fits up there really conveniently. Now we're going to attempt to put our one. And a half inch inside this ball cavity which will require the water lines to be pushed. And flex around it a little bit. So what i'm going to do is first of all i'm going to cut through the water lines this is the hot this is the cold i know this because the right side on the back of a fixture is always hot let's make life easy for. Now we'll cut here. And we'll cut here okay. Now it's easy to flex i'm going to take the opportunity to put my fittings on for the water supply here we're interrupting to steal some water one of the benefits of working with pexers is usually a little flexibility in the lines okay. So we'll get all this done for a hot in our cold. And we'll get this crimped. And then you see all the movement that gives us the flexibility we need. So we're going to do all the crimping first we're not going to be able to do that once these lines are under pressure from the pipe. So it's best to get this done in advance again of course always use the solid copper rings the pinch clamps fail let's measure what we want to do is we want to have a pipe come from inside this come down. And then have a p-trap okay. So here is a p-trap. So now we're going to measure. And by having that p-trap sitting on the ground. And coming straight out of the wall that's perfect. So we're going to dry fit it just eyeball with your thumb line up your cutting tool press. And twist we're officially cut. And measured here we go. But how do we keep it in the wall code is going to require all of this is glued in place right what we're going to do is get the glue work done first. Then we're going to tie it in because we can just set this in position i should be careful of my words right careful your words jeffrey this is not glue this is a solvent. And as such you want to put it on both sides the fitting. And the pipe line this one up at 90 degrees. So it's coming out of the wall nice you only got a couple of seconds to get that done okay. And then again fitting in the pipe because it's a solvent that's effectively melting the. And then after a few seconds it hardens up again okay done that's that's modern-day plumbing you don't need a plumber to do this you just need the right tools. And the right information okay plumbers will be happy to never have to do silly things like run pex water lines again for the rest of their life there's better ways that they can make money all right this is called all round comes in a little box find in the plumbing aisle that comes in copper stainless steel regular galvanized okay it's just a few bucks. But it gives you all the flexibility for tying all your mechanical together. So nothing's moving around. Now we can take our all-around we can get this in position. And what we're doing here is not attaching the pipe to the strap simply creating an environment where this pipe can't be protruding past the framing we can do that again up here too because there's a lot of tension going on with this plumbing if there isn't a lot of tension you can just throw the strap across okay because we got a little bit of tension,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=0,"['What is the process for all of the mechanical hookups and electrical requirements for running a new dryer and washer?', 'How do you move laundry from one part of the house to another without damaging any existing systems?', 'What are the plumbing requirements for installing a washer box in a wall with a blocking obstruction?', 'How do you measure and cut PEX water lines to fit around a p-trap in a wall cavity?', 'What is an all-around strap used for in modern-day plumbing and how does it help with tying together mechanical systems?']"

And we're going to use this as a way of forcing the pipe back in position see how everything's moved there we go this isn't an under enough stress down here. So [music] we'll do the same thing down here that's just not enough pressure good. So my pipe's in position everything's being held back this is already crimped all i gotta do is connect my water lines cold the cold. And then hot to hot just a quick tip when you get your pecs off a coil it looks like this okay you can just straighten it out by bringing a few feet at a time. And just work it the other way until it straightens out a little bit there that's a little easier to work with. Now what we're going to do is we're going to measure by sticking the pecs in position twisting it over. And then marking it with the cutters. And cutting it that simple. Now what we're going to do is we're going to stick one ring on each end. And then put the pipe in place okay you want to push one way. And then push back the other way create like an s curve pop it in place okay slide the rings down into position within an eighth of an inch of the joint close completely. And know you're good do the same with the cold water line there we are boom it is good practice to run your water lines a few inches apart. So they're not making contact hot. And cold running together make condensation condensation will drip inside a wall that can develop a problem. So in this situation treat it like you would as if you had an electrical wire running over a heat run because in those situations you have hot with hot. And you can cause fire this situation you'll do with condensation just by insulating it using that half inch pipe wrap that you can find that black foam stuff with the yeah that works too well here we go washer box is installed all right. So let's go through it we got our dryer done we got our basha box we got our drain. Now now this is for roughing. So my plan for passing inspection is to demonstrate that i have the drain. And the p-trap the venting isn't really all that necessary because i'm putting it right into my santa cube right away if i fail because of venting i would be amazed because this pipe hooks here. And air can actually follow okay. And the santa cube box has its own dedicated vent. So we're going to take this one. And a half inch orange plastic cap it's called the test cap we're simply going to dry fit it on the pipe okay demonstrating the fact that this is not glued in. But this is temporary.

But this is temporary. Now we have to move on to our electrical because our plumbing is done for roughing. Now i know it's that simple don't over complicate things as long as you get all of the rough fins which means the mechanical functions enter the room. And leave the room whether they're connected or not is not part of rough-in it's just having the ability to make the connections a later date where those connections can. Then be inspected okay. So when the inspector comes he's gonna be like okay you got water supply you soldered it that's good done drain when i come back i'm going to see how the santa cube is installed that'll determine whether i pass this or not. And that's what's going on in his brain. So everything's in the room all we've got to do. Now is connect pipe in the ceiling where the vent will go. And tie in over there. So the next part of this process is gonna be different for everybody what we have to do. Now because i'm using a santa flo is i have to have a vent tie in. And i have to have an extraction like a like a drain pipe the units themselves have the ability depending on the lift up 15 or 25 or 50 feet. And out 150 feet or more. So it's not an issue to tie in in a basement like this that's why i love the flexibility that's why we use them every time i have to open concrete or tie into something that's underneath the subfloor like what we have here it's a lot more time. And expense. And frustration. So just spending the money on a unit. And moving forward. And knowing you're going to get a good result it saves a lot of energy. So we're going to tie into the old bathroom fan which was a wet vent it's confirmed as tie into the system. And then we're going to tie into the existing vent that's over there with a t-mold with a t-fitting for the vent for the santa cube the process will be different for everybody depending on your on your scenario like i said. But just make sure that every time you have a drain you have a vent that's really the key all right well your plumbing won't work [applause] again the question i keep asking myself why did they run the doorbell wire right at the joint of a ceiling one of the most dangerous places to run anywhere. So whenever you're tying into your venting the key is really to make your measurement. And your mark to the inside of these coupling joints. So that this goes over the existing pipe that's left okay. So i'm just going to reach up here give myself a little bit of room to work with mark on the pipe the top. And the bottom knowing this that once i've disengaged this section of pipe this top part will have some flexibility okay we'll be able to set this on. And get the adhesive in without any issue all right i keep calling the solvent adhesive i don't know why bad slang habits all right here goes everything kids here we are try to cut this somewhat straight that's great. And because we're only dealing with air here i don't have to worry too much about the bur action okay. So [music] [applause] okay let me get rid of the old pipe that was interesting there was water in there there it is check that out this vent pipe was holding water that means it's coming off that elbow. And rising up. So every time it rains the water's collecting in the bottom of that pipe well. Then let's take the opportunity to fix that yeah we're going to cut off a little bit more of this pipe. So that when we connect it we've got more of a downward angle. And we don't have that problem if your pipe is collecting too much water the air can't flow. So then what's the good is the vat the vent right all right let's take another inch. And change off of this just enough to get some solvent on that's much better okay. Now when i stick this in i also want to have it sloping down in a perfect world my pipe even those events will also have a slope up because if you ever do get some confused individual in the future tying into your vent to do a drain line at least it'll still function maybe not perfectly. But at least function. So lots of solvent on here give us some extra drying time we're going to be speedy instead of perfect here we're not going to worry about how pretty we are we're just going to get her done. And it's venting. So don't have to worry about being too watertight it's more about getting it in getting it on. And getting out all right. And getting that angle downward slope. And then the water came out that's a good sign okay beautiful. Now i also have this two inch pipe here that we've identified is running into the drain this is a wet vent drain system going on right here what we're gonna do oh my well that's not gonna work too well i need a coupling for that bad boy i'm going to,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=579,"['What type of connections are made during the rough-in process in plumbing?', 'Why is it important to have both a vent and a drain pipe when installing a Santa Cube?', 'How do you determine if a plumbing connection will be suitable for a basement installation?', 'What is the purpose of using a solvent adhesive in plumbing installations?', 'How does the angle of a vent pipe affect its functionality?']"

And a half inch plumbing it's this simple let me show you this is called a reducer coupling. And it goes over the one. And a half inch pipe. And then a two inch coupling fits over top of that. And then your two inch pipe goes inside of that really all you got to do is have the right fittings lots of solvent. And make sure that you put the solvent on the pipe. And the fitting okay this is what makes this sole system work. And then we put solvent on this fitting. And then inside the coupling all right. And then we put solvent inside the coupling. And then over the pipe tell me watch yourselves boom we get the pipe in the ceiling. And then put the coupling over the pipe. And twist perfect every time. Now i'm just going to measure across the other side of the wall cut. And fit the pipe. And stick it over here on that t fitting. And then we'll put a couple of elbows coming through the ceiling. And that'll officially be roughed in 56. And a half we'll go 57 for good measure there we go 57 over here oh this is the good stuff the real good abs is a lot harder to cut than the stuff you get from home depot it's not actually abs they just allow us to use it. And i don't know why all right into the cavity back over here okay solvent again by the time you've done this three or four times you'll be like yep that is way too easy okay set the glue worry about the cap on that glue later it's all about getting this in all right. And i'm gonna take my cut off piece of pipe use it as a spacer to hold it up done room to work. So this is one of these moments where i just get brutally honest with my audience  i screwed up this pipe is a little long. And the other pipe is way too short i don't know what i did wrong with my measuring. But if you follow my channel at all you know half the times i'm giving you measurements on in the video i've made a mistake i can't i thought that was simple measured the space i added thickness for the plate. And the drywall. And somehow i still ended up good two inches short. So there's a couple different ways you can fix it this is the best part. Now we get to watch how we fix it when you go too long you cut the pipe back that's the easy fix right. So here we go [applause] yep done when you go too short. Then you got to be creative here's one option that might work i haven't checked to see if i don't i think it's too short. But you can use instead of a short 90 you can use a long sweeping 90. And it tends to reach out yeah it's going to be just a little bit too short okay. So no big deal i can use it on this one that'll work what i'm going to use is a coupling okay. And couplings are simple they're just wider than the pipe. And they're just designed for pipe to go on each side. And then a put a pipe extension. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to install this onto the pipe that's sitting there. And then i'm going to measure to use this fitting to have this coming out over here so,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=869,"['What type of coupling is used for plumbing?', 'How does a reducer coupling work?', 'Why is it important to apply solvent to fittings and couplings?', 'What happens when you cut a pipe too long or too short?', 'Can you use a different type of fitting instead of a standard 90-degree elbow?']"

So step one is to get the coupling installed because you don't want to do too many of these joints at the same time you start measuring. And everything else things dry too fast we're just going to get up here do the pipe as well reach in. And slide that on there we go okay. And i want it to come. And what i'm doing is i'm drive measuring okay i'm just i'm sticking it up against the fitting all right to get an idea where this is. And then it'll go back three quarters of an inch when i'm done okay. So i'm gonna go to here let's cut this pipe your plumbing has to be as perfect as your solution for finishing okay if you're doing it yourself. And i've got a hole in the ceiling like i said i was going to put a box around this well i'm going to end up putting a box around this too. So probably have a box around the whole darn thing make one box that gives me a lot of flexibility i didn't want to have the trouble of cutting through the plate or drilling holes or lining things up to the millimeter bring it down cutting through the fire oh i've got plumbing down there too just put it on the surface make your life simple. And then we can all move on here we go on solvent on the pipe the solvent in the fitting okay reach. And stick it in. And twist there we go that's a good spot. Then i'll use a regular angle. And i'll get that on the pipe as well there we go get this one in here. And you want to make sure that you do install these 90 degrees. So the next pipe will fit nice right let's get this one glued on as well this one is going to be for the ejection. So we got to get rid of the burrs we don't want to have anything making contact there i know some guys use a special tool to deburr i just like to use my thumb okay set it nice set it nice i think everything here is lined up pretty darn good i'm just put a piece of pipe with a cap on it orange caps tell the inspector that it's rough in okay beautiful. Now i've got room to get inspected. And get my drywall up in behind everything close this wall off all we got to do. Now is bring electrical services to all of our machines. So we need electrical for the sanic flow pump electrical for the dryer. And electrical for the washer we're almost done. So you want to have a little bit of fun you're not going to believe this i  got in touch with the guys from santa flow they're going to bring the pump out for me. And i had a concern right about pumping it up through into the existing what we thought was a wet vent. And i wanted to know if he had a way to test that theory. And he didn't. And since we didn't know where it was going i said well can we put it in over here. And i was concerned because being under pressure maybe it would end up in the sink. And he told me this we're going to bring this wire over to this box. And hook up the pump. So all the water will come to it. And we're going to bring it up. And then once it takes a 90 degree it goes from under pressure to gravity. And now that it's a gravity line it acts like any other waistline. So all i have to do is add a 90 here. And then a ty on top of it add another 45 to get the nice long turn okay. And then i can bring it right across. And tie in to where my sink is problem solved. But what i've got to do here also is upgrade this if i touch this pipe i can't leave it. So now i'm going to extend this pipe up to the top which means i have to move the water line stick on a metal plate to protect it. And i'd have to lose my medicine cabinet because i don't have enough room for the pipe. And what i would do is i'd take this fitting with the male thread also the female thread. And this little cheater vent. And this becomes my fresh air for this sink okay. And it has to be installed higher than the flood plain of the sink. And so what i like to do in this situation is put in a fresh air return grill like a cold air returning vent in the ceiling. And then this is perfectly legal problem is is i have to take this wood off. And the medicine cabinet has to go. And all this work has to be done. So what i'm going to do instead is this i'm going to add furring on the wall two by two all my studs i'm going to build up the wall give myself a little more room to do the rest of this plumbing he also told me that they updated the code. Now i know right. Now it's really hard to get two inch p pbs okay every store in town is out there's like a mad brush for building materials. So if you're like me. And you need to find something. And home depot doesn't have it what you do is you go to the country stores contractors don't have the time to drive all the way out into the country to go find a piece of abs. So they still have plenty of stock. So don't be afraid to check it out i have to update this to a two inch okay not a big deal the only difference is is because i abs. And this is a pvc i have to use this transition cement okay because it'll bond the two different materials together. And then we're good. Now because all these water lines are tied in to go into the shower i don't have anything here for water hammer okay it's not needed i've had plumbers tell me over the years you don't need to worry about the water hammer arresters on pecks it still happens a little bit this plumber says you should still have them. But he says because they're built in with the laundry this will still give you a lot of protection. So i don't expect to have any problems other than that i have the second vent line i'm gonna just glue on a solid cap okay we're gonna treat it like it could have water one day. And we'll use glue we aren't just gonna stick it on there or use a test cap. And then that should be it for us okay  turns out the wire the pump that we're getting is just a 15 amp regular plug-in. So we're just going to wire this box for a plug that's a full update it's a little interesting listen you you never stop learning as you go in this business because the rules are always changing plumbers don't get emails from the building code people when they change the building code they have to constantly be researching. And a lot of research comes when the inspector shows up. And says by the way you're doing that wrong it's a crazy world we live in right. So as i grow. And i learn. And the rules change i'll continue to bring that information. But if you have different building code rules where you live. Then put them in the comments section for us okay guys there's a lot of guys watch this video if you're plumbers electricians or hvac guys or even carpenters. And the rules are different where you are let us know in the comment section help the community out all right huh. So now we got our exhaust done we've got a roughin water supply drain vent system hooked up. And we've got our pipe tied in for the removal of all of the shower water. And the laundry water that we're gonna pump through our santa flow we need electrical  we need three sources of electric i need a wire for the santa flo unit. And i need a plug for the washing machine. And i need a dryer outlet okay. So washing machine is gonna go over here we're gonna find a place where this box fits on the wall. And i'm using metal boxes that have teeth okay. And so that sets the depth on the front teeth for the same thickness as the drywall all right. And the rear teeth we just hammer in place once i have that set up. Then i can add screws top. And bottom to hold it in place forever important to note this is a welded box that means that's a welded joint there are a lot of boxes out there that have screws on the top. And the sides open up. And you can add it's called gang-able box okay they also come in plastic boxes that's an option as well in this case because it's welded i don't have to add any wood over here if it was gangable i'd have to add wood here as well. And add that to the drywall screw it all together okay that's part of the coat. So that it it doesn't disengage by accident all right a little tidbit no big deal. And then this this is our dryer box this is not a regular square this is a 4. And 9 16. Okay it's dryer box size. And there is these knockouts all right. So i'm going to find a side that has two holes. So that i can mount it dryer's over here somewhere i'm going to mount,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=1086,"['What type of joints are recommended for initial measurements in plumbing?', 'Why do plumbers need to install pipes and fittings before measuring other components?', 'How does the solvent work with the fitting in a plumbing system?', 'What is the purpose of using a fresh air return grill in plumbing installation?', 'What type of electrical connections are required for a Sanic flow pump, dryer, and washer?']"

So that i can mount it dryer's over here somewhere i'm going to mount the dryer box here that'll be good. And i want to have it sticking out just a little bit. Now this particular wood is a little bit crooked. So i'm going to set it back a little bit. So it doesn't stick out too much i'll screw it in my wire coming through from the top because we're going to follow all of our wiring is going to go up into the ceiling across. And then over to the mechanical room. So let's open up our knockout first there we go come on honey there we go that's one side that a smaller hole is for three quarter this is a one inch ring clamp let's try hammering this one loose [applause] there we go. Now mount these boxes with the screws on the outside okay. And then you put the ring on. And it's important to note that this has to be installed fairly tight this is the security of holding this wire in place. And in a lot of cases we're dealing with serious voltage. So take a screwdriver or your drill bit. And you you tighten it up like that in place. And you hit it a couple of times try to get another quarter turn out of it there we go. Now when it's on it's on it's not going anywhere ever again. Now we're ready to go. Now we can mount this bad boy we're gonna go with two screws we're gonna have a box all the way to here i'm gonna set this up a little lower in this case the dryer will be here right. And it comes up about this high. And then there will be a mechanical box covering all of the other panels want to have access to this without having it hidden in behind the box. So that's why i'm putting it lower you don't need to access this without pulling the dryer out. So this will be fine all right all we got to do is run our wiring piece of cake okay so,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=1565,"['What type of wood was used for mounting the dryer box?', 'Why did the installer set the wood back a little bit?', 'What is the purpose of using ring clamps in electrical installations?', 'How tightly should the ring clamp be tightened to ensure security?', 'Where will the mechanical box cover all other panels?']"

So before you run your wiring you need two things you got to make sure you you've tracked where you're going to go got to have the end from the beginning right. So we're going to be drilling through this plate running wire inside the wall we're going to. Then be drilling through this plate to run our wire up into the ceiling cavity. And then it will come down onto the surface. And we'll travel across it's going to go up into a floor joist cavity. And then go over to the mechanical room once we've got our path figured out. Then we'll run the wire. So i'll drill holes. And i'm going to bash some holes in the drywall. And i'm gonna expose i'm gonna rip off a good chunk of this drywall here. And expose the one by three because i have to have a nailing surface wire has to have a staple in it every five feet. So if i can't satisfy that. Then i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pass my inspection very important that you have your path laid out you've got at least a hole that the wire passes through or a staple every five feet once you've sorted out your path. Then you can run your wire yeah it's a little bigger than it needs to be. But it's all i could find. So if you're concerned at all about the depth of your wire you can always add a metal plate. And they just hammer on if you haven't seen that before  we'll link in the video description we moved the electrical receptacles for our kitchen. And in both of those cases we had to add those boxes. So there's some more information on there if you need it as well there we go. And because i'm going to be installing a box all the way along it doesn't really matter how much of this i'd cut out as long as i'm within the confines of what i think my box is going to look like. So [applause] [music] [applause] there's my nailing surface [applause] [music] [applause] hey [applause] [applause]. So here's a unique situation  we have rules about the staples in the holes there's a third option. And that is you can fish because there's no need for a hole or a staple if you're not going to be installing drywall over a location the holes. And staples are designed to keep the wire secured. So you don't penetrate it with a screw. But if you fish there's no screwing going on. So then that's another option. So i can effectively just fish it right up through this hole over here. And then i can feed it to the other side of this beam from here all right. And then we'll get we'll do another fishing location. And we'll just have a little patch to do instead of a whole box i think we will see we don't know what we're gonna find until we go there okay. Now remember for roughing all we gotta do is have the wire in the room. So the other side of this door. So we're going to punch a hole here [applause] what we see here is as long as i feed that on this side of the joist i can go underneath the joist. And into the room that is awesome oh there's already a hole there i'm just going to cut out a little bit of the drywall in the ceiling inside of here [applause] okay. Now i can get the wire in there [music] all right. Now we got our highway time to run the wire hey there it is okay the next hole is here. And the rest is staples. Now that's a staple right look at the size of that monster when you're in the store the  the wires all have gauge sizes. And staples are related to that. And they'll say on the package s1 is for normal s2 is for like a three wire okay  i think this is a four this is for dryer. So i got a hole i gotta have a staple here somewhere every five feet instead of using that surface i'm gonna use the floor joist [music]. And here's something very important the staple. And this little pin on the side okay that's a depth setter that tells you how much room you need to from the surface wood for the space you don't want the wire under too much compression okay that's perfect any more compression than that you can run yourself into trouble you can pinch the wire. And people see it all the time there hammer these staples till the wire is compressed that's a choke point. And it gets overheated when a wire gets old that's the kind of place where it's gonna start to fire okay one two three less than five feet. But i'm going to throw another staple on anyway just for good measure because it looks sloppy when inspector comes in. And he sees that you're going above code it usually is a good thing  the only thing we have left to do is to get that wire into the furnace room for full disclosure this is an old piece of wire that i had laying around i actually  had this for the farmhouse. But i mismeasured. So now i'm using here i've been dragging around with me forever because that bit of wire i think was 280 bucks i'm not much for throwing up money. So what i'm going to do. Now is i'm going to get it in here because it's in the room it passes. And then i'm going to put it in a box. And then buy the wire that i need to get to the panel okay. So this is for roughing we're going to put a bit of a curve on it. And fish it up. And over here it is all right mission accomplished the dryer stove is. Now up to code ready to pass inspection the only thing we got to do is we have to get it into the box don't forget the connection going into the box is not going to be visible after drywall goes on again that's what you're looking for what's going to be buried behind drywall versus what's visible. Now as long as you satisfy what's going to be buried everything else will be visible later can wait till later,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=1692,"['What are the two essential things to ensure before running wiring?', 'Why is it necessary to have a nailing surface for wire installation?', 'What is an alternative to drilling holes and using staples in drywall?', 'How often should staples be spaced when installing wire?', 'What happens if the staple is not installed correctly?']"

So for final inspection here's what they're going to do depending on how much trust they have. And what you've done they might do one of two things hey they might turn the dryer on to see if they the electrical connections are hooked up properly what you can't do is just stick the wire in here. And walk away you need to be very careful here not to cut your hand okay you have to expose the sheathing you want to leave about an inch inside the box okay because this compression has to be like that i want to get a staple just above the box just because there's a lot of things going on here i don't want him worried that this wire is going to get interrupted with drywall. And then i'm going to take this. And i'll put compression on the wire. So that it can't be yanked out they sometimes they'll do a yank test. And then you can take this onto here what you're looking at here is a situation where it might seem like there's enough wire here. But let me show you something when you go to finish you've got to have one of these. And you'll see the three the black white. And the red all go from one side. Now these are long. So that's that's good the ground comes off this side. So if this is a ground are you able to strip. And connect these three wires okay. And then peel it back. And then push it in if the answer is yes. Then you're fine. But if there's not enough ground wire here to go through this screw. And connect. And get into here. And then do all your connections. Then you're gonna have to tug a little more wire through okay loosen this off give myself a little more wire in my case i'm gonna be fine. So that's cool. But the inspector is gonna be looking for this is my screw tightened on that ground wire. So when they come they can visually they can see that they see there's lots of wire here i'm going to have all this tucked in because i'm going to be drywalling okay they give the tug test the check for staples they check every five feet yes yes yes staple staple good all right great wire. Now you're moving on right. So let's go through the same process with the regular wire it's just the same process exactly only with smaller,https://youtu.be/hJIh5ztaBHs?t=2146,"['What is the purpose of exposing the sheathing when working with electrical connections?', 'How do electricians ensure that wires are not cut or damaged during installation?', 'What is the significance of leaving a certain amount of space between the wire and the box?', 'Can you explain the process of performing a yank test on an electrical connection?', 'Why is it important to visually inspect the ground wire for staples and connections?']"

And the plate this is the fire blocking right this used to be a commercial building. So fire blocking is part of code. Now that we're making it residential it's not necessary. So i could knock it out. But might cause damage to the other side right let's get up here we need a hole those self-fed systems work really great right up to the very end [laughter]. And you got to push thing we're going to just run this wire the same path use the staples feed it through get it into the other room the difference is in this case is we'll run enough wire to get right over to the panel. And then all the way to the floor plus an extra few feet okay. And then all we're going to do is take out a black marker. And we're going to label on their washer that way we know what we're hooking up there we go sometimes when you're fishing between holes it gets a little difficult to reach. So the world invented fish tapes. And this works really great you hold the end. And you can just pull it out of the handle. And this travels over a lot easier there it is let's get it over there gotcha. So it's a very short run. So i don't really need to go through the whole process i could just tape it together. But for the sake of showing you something let's do the entire process we take off the sheathing we cut back the black. And the white we create a hook in the copper no [laughter] my kingdom for a bench that was tall enough for this room unfortunately it is a bloody 10-foot ceiling all right. So now we'll show you how to put it back in hold the inside. And you just run the handle around. And it pulls it all back be careful working with this stuff it is a thin metal band it likes to fly around it's got its own mind there it is there. And you hook it through. And we take our tape. Now and you just basically are trying to get rid of anything that can snag that's all you wanna have a smooth run through the ceiling. And we push. And pull at the same time don't just pretend you're fishing pulling a big tuna out of the out of the water okay push. And pull here we go there we go oh okay let's fish this through here. Now i've got enough to get to the ground. But as you can see my panel is way over there. But i don't want to go across the middle of the ceiling i'm going to go straight back that looks like about six feet another six feet over add a couple more we're gonna pull 14 more feet of wire we'll do that right here that's how much i needed the box. So i'm going to stretch it out four feet 12 feet 16 feet that's my run here we go. And now i'll pull that the rest of the way through. And we'll take enough here to finish that construction that's fine okay i just need to put a staple come to the back okay okay stove wire is a stove wire prima guy's going to know that this is the washer line that's for the final okay. Now we're going to take the tab bend it back flatten out we're going to take the wire. And location through the hole this here i'm going to cut the sheathing. And i'm going to twist my hand about one degree just. So that i'm running down the copper wire. Now there are other tools out there for stripping wire. But i grew up doing this. So i'm just i don't want to learn any new tricks here we go same thing you put the wire through there okay. And then you bend it. So when you push this wire back it sticks out through the front okay you bend it boom all right. And then it's all sitting right here bring it through the same rule okay have a little bit of sheathing showing on this side of the box tighten that up go like this get that ground wire screw connected all right there we go. Now we got lots of wire for our plug we're going to curl it all back in there. So they don't damage the wires when we install our drywall. Now my rotozip can drive around the box no problem at all. Now we need a few staples one you're going to want just on the outside of the box right here let's see all right there's those tabs again. And for good measure we're gonna throw a staple up here. Now the inspector's gonna say how are you closing that up i'm gonna tell them i'm gonna build a little box here okay. And that way i can use that strapping as a staple mount as well there we go that's done. Now there's one more thing i have to do i have to run a 14 gauge wire it's a two wire over to where the santa flow pump is gonna go it's the same process i'll just push it through. And i'll bring it down to the ground. And i'm gonna leave it coiled up at the ground out here. And here's the reason why is i don't know how the santa flo is hooked up. So by going with the two wire black. And white for the santa cube i'll go with the surface mounted box. So it can be expected after the fact. So he's gonna be cool with that. And i have the ability to put in a 15 amp breaker regular switch if that's all the power i need it'll carry 20 amps if i need that no problem it'll also give me a 240 voltage system where the black. And white can both carry power to the pump because i've installed a saniflow pump before that was big enough it needed that. So the the biggest pump they have takes 240 power that wire can handle all three of the spectrums. So we're just going to run it. And then i'll be like i'm not sure what i'm using i'm going to use the surface mounted box. And we'll get that hooked up later. And he'll be like cool hopefully fingers crossed that's the question am i going to pass the code inspection or not i don't know there's two different inspectors i'm pretty sure what i've got set up here is going to work it's unorthodox it's in a unique situation make sure you check out next week's video to see if i actually pass the inspection you know some of you might be asking why are you only getting occupancy jeff why aren't you going to finish the whole renovation it's a darn good question to be honest with you i've already lost a year. And a half owning this church because i wasn't unable to get trades to come in here. And give me a hand with the major aspects of this build because of covet. And two i'm at a point. Now where i would rather just be able to move on. And do something a little different than renovating a church. So you're gonna have to stay tuned to find out what that different is okay you know.

And today we are dealing with doors. And trim  i just finished trimming it out which basically means to hang the door add the casings. And so today's video is going to be all about how to finish from here like how to get the best finish possible one of the ways that you get good return on investment when you're doing your own diy projects is to know how to get a professional finish. So today's video i'm going to show you brush. And roll. And i'm going to show you believe it or not the 40 wagner power sprayer we're going to do both of these applications for finishing the doors. And the trim. So that you have options in your arsenal the preparation. And the process is different for both i'm going to teach you all my insider tricks i'm going to teach you which products i like to use for my caulking. And for filling nail holes all of this kind of information all right. So that you can get a professional finish when you're doing your project let's just jump right into this because step number one is all about the prep. And that means we've got to take the doors off of the hinges. Now i've got a process that i've developed over the years that works really effective for me what i'm going to do is i'm going to take this hinge off of here. And then pop the other two pins to remove the door. And then i'm going to finish removing all the hardware okay. And when you go to install it again you'll find that by installing it on the two the two hinges. And then screwing the third hinge on is going to save you a ton of time because even when they come from a supplier like i use you're a fan of my channel you know i like classic wood molding. And they do all these doors custom for me okay. So when they arrive they already got all the hinges in place. And you just stick them together there's always little variances. And it drives you nuts trying to put it together. So if you're only installing two instead of three hinges,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=0,"['What is the first step in finishing doors and trim?', 'How do you remove a door from its hinges?', 'Why is removing hardware important for finishing doors and trim?', 'What are some common variances that can occur when installing hinges?', 'What type of products does Jeff recommend using for caulking and filling nail holes?']"

But this is what we're gonna do all right. So you've gotta get organized have maybe a ziploc bag or something somewhere that you can put all of your screws. And hardware [applause] okay boom. Now we're just going to pop the other two off boom okay hold it from the top all right one down okay. Now when you're finishing your doors. And trim just get rid of the hinges don't try to be a superhero. And paint around them cover them all up in tape this only takes seconds. And it'll make sure your job finishes perfect every time the truth is it takes longer to put tape on than it does just to remove the hinge. Now you want to make sure that you're using here there's a lot of different companies make this stuff. But it's a siliconized acrylic caulking this isn't a painter's cocking this is for doors. And windows it's a 30-year product. And it goes on really awesome just cut the tip on the angle okay. And you want to do this first because this takes about an hour or. So to dry closer to two before you can paint all right. So you want to get all your prep work done get your caulking on as fast as possible. And with the hinges gone you can do this gap right here. And if that gap is cocked. Then your doors are going to look amazing at the end because you're not going to have that obvious gap behind every one of your hinges that everybody gets when they tape them on oh let me go. So now we're going to get into what separates the men from the boys when it comes to your finishing work everywhere you have wood contacting wood even if there's a nail in there. And it's got a nice tight joint most professional painters do not this joint here on the door trim okay. And i don't know why because they're all guaranteed to crack at some point in time there's always going to be expansion contraction house. And those joints will always crack. Now you don't want a lot of caulking in there because you've got a door closing right. But a good finisher will always install this trim just a millimeter away from the door. And then what you do you want to go with that cut tip almost flat to this piece you see there okay just on a bit of an angle. And you're gonna add just a little bit of material. So that it fills that gap without being a huge concave mess okay. But you're still going to want to have a little something there this is where less is more you're going to want to do every joint in that same manner every joint even these little ones around here don't expect the paint to solve all your problems there's a gap. Now there'll be a gap later. And if it's your house you can avoid the gap most track housing in north america is not built to look as good as it does the first day you buy it within a year okay they cut all kinds of corners. And this is one of the ones they cut the most takes a long time to do your finishing trim properly. But it is worth all the effort you put into it you also want to just put a tiny little drip right here on this corner even if you glue your joints if there's a joint here your best bet is to use the caulking to wipe that in okay just a bit of a rub. And then get rid of all the excess make sure you don't fill the nail holes with it either that's not what caulking is for never use your caulking to fill a nail hole because caulking shrinks a little bit when it dries. And you're gonna get a bad look if you want to finish this you're going to want to use this product i know it looks kind of like something like the nfl would put together. But the truth is it has a compound in here where it's  it's pink when it's wet. And then dries white. And that's how you know when to sand okay. So here's the system less is more take your finger do a little dab. And fill the hole okay that's it okay just a little bit of product because you don't want to have a whole lot of it sitting on here that you got to sand off the more control you use. Now the less work later you don't want it filling up all your contour okay. And creating bumps. And ridges. And just get a little bit in that hole. And then wipe it clean,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=102,"['What type of caulking is recommended for doors and windows?', 'Why is it important to remove hinges before finishing work?', 'How long does the caulking take to dry before painting?', 'What is the purpose of using a compound in caulking?', 'How much product should be used when filling nail holes with caulking?']"

And then wipe it clean. So when you're prepping your project remember caulking first one to two hours. Then you can do all your dry dex work right. Then you've got time while all that is setting up to finish off setting up your floor. So you want to vacuum it out we're going to show you how to tape it all off. So you don't have overspray on your flooring because remember the best way to do this kind of work is put the flooring down first. Then do all your carpentry on top of it one of the secrets to this process is paint your trim one coat before you install it you'll notice that when i do the drydex touch-ups. And the caulking the caulking is white it only needs one coat the dry decks only needs one coat really. So don't be too worried about this kind of thing if you paint it all first. And you see flashing you can always touch up the dry decks a little bit if you need to. But at least you're not going to be putting nails in that sort of thing within a couple inches of the floor right. So you don't have to go right to the edge of the floor with your paint brush when you're trimming it in you can leave a quarter of an inch no one's ever going to see if it's one coat or two coat at the floor that's not a concern all right okay. So now i got to clean up a little bit cut back some paper. And do some taping,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=405,"['What is the recommended time for caulking before starting other prep work?', 'Why should flooring be installed first in this process?', 'What is one of the secrets to this painting and carpentry process?', 'How many coats are typically needed for dry decks and trim?', 'Can you touch up flashing with dry decks if necessary?']"

And do some taping okay get that out of the way. So for the purpose of the demonstration today i'm going to be spraying this column. And i'm going to use the brush. And the roller on the other side. But i'm going to show you the different ways to tape off here we go what i'm doing is i'm following the line of the trim i'm trying to tape see that that last little eighth of an inch don't care about it for the purpose of a sprayer you're never going to make that perfect the point is this when we're working with acrylic paints you're going to want to have either some nail polish remover with acetone in it or you can just buy a little jug of acetone at the hardware store you're going to have that as a backup in case you get any overspray. And it's a good rule as a as a rule in general if you're painting your house have the acetone available surfaces like flooring. And windows. And that sort of thing you can clean the paint off real effectively using a q-tip. And acetone. And when we're here right we're creating an environment here where i'm not going to wreck my flooring okay i don't want to have to rely on the tarp alone for this well the only time i use painters tape is when i'm doing my trim bring the tarp up. And around okay like that. And only you're all asking what about this little space over here well we're going to cut a piece of baseboard we're going to install it with caulking only. And then we're just going to paint it all in i'll show you that in a second gotta make sure your paint's well shucked ah there we are lovely. So here is my suggestion for everybody out there who's working on their house if you're gonna install your trim on top of finished flooring at the very least paint the bottom of your trim okay when you install it you can nail on the higher surfaces you never have to have a brush come close to the floor if you paint your bottom of your base first if you paint the edge of your casings first it's just the easiest money. Now when you're painting you want to paint with just a little bit of paint this is not the time to try to slap it on. So thick that it covers in one coat the effective way to paint trim okay. So that you don't get too much texture you don't get those paint lines from the brush use less paint use three coats if you need to this stuff here is going to dry in about 10 minutes. And i can re-coat i'm just going to set it off to the side. And re-coat okay. And then i can cut it. And install it. And it's all finished don't have to worry about don't paint like this on your trim don't go like that okay look at look how horrible that looks looks like something painted from 1905 with lead in the oil you know it's disgusting there's. So much paint there all right don't do it no i'm just going to take me a week to dry this out. So we'll set this aside we'll let it dry. And then we're going to cut. And snap them in. And we'll move on to the next part of the prep work because. Now my drydex is all finished i'm going to sand it all in. And then i'm going to vacuum it all up because when you're painting dirt is your enemy gotta have a clean jobsite wash your brush between every use don't let it sit around because it'll be garbage in about 10 minutes. So this is the kind of sanding block i like to use guys all right you get these at the home depot they've got the angle. So i can do my drywall sanding. But the coolest thing about this is even if your sponge is worn out from prepping your room you've got to still have good corners on these sides you hardly ever let that touch the wall. Now you get to use the other half the sanding sponge. So don't throw them out if the front gets destroyed because what we're going to do is we're going to set these corners in every one of these grooves okay wherever we see there was dry decks recontour the trim all right. So now the hole is filled. But you can't even see the hole there's no material left on the trim. So these ones are gooped up really good just to make sure. And make the point of how this works right let's set that in the contour the next contour this little edge use the sponge to follow the contour you can you can press it right into the contour right. And then i got one more ridge here bam. Now the hole is filled. And the trim looks perfect you only get one chance to get this perfect okay. And perfect is what you want to start with because everything you do for finishing work is a lot easier if you're working with a perfect surface [music] there you go. So at the same time it took me to sand down my trims this is ready to go. Now we're going to cut. And install the sucker there we go one. And five eighths one in just under a half. So the secret here when you're doing this kind of work guys is the thickness of this trim is the same as the thickness of the casing depending on your wall you might need to set it off the wall a little bit. So you get that nice flush finish at the bottom. So let's stick this in here first that's mildly proud interesting all right. So i don't want to put a lot of adhesive on here or caulking all right i'll just put a few dabs i'll do. And the one across the top that'll squeeze out okay here we go watch this squeeze it out all right. Then we're just going to want to it in place one down. Now the reason you don't want to use nails is because with little pieces of wood if you see the profile a lot of times they're hollow on the back you don't want to nail down here because. Then you got to touch it up. And sand it right. And you're painting close to the floor again. And if you put your nail up here you run the risk of snapping it. And it could break in half okay. So don't use any nails in small pieces well that's lunch it's hot up here today my goodness  we're gonna just take a quick break let it all finish drying. Then we come back we're gonna do all the painting all right guys last thing in the prep list kills right. And the reason we want this is because whenever you're dealing with like a finger joint pine or any like wood that's not mdf you're going to have the occasional knot or stain area. So you're going to want to try to preemptively strike this right. So the trim that comes from my trim shop is all primed in advance if there was discoloration or staining that was going to come through i'd see it already. And so most of this wood looks pretty darn good. But there is this one stain right here that is a little bit of a knot imagine that that's all it takes mission accomplished. Now i got a bit of a drip here i don't want the drip. So i'll clean that up here's the deal on the can it says wait an hour to paint it's good advice they put it on there because that speaks to every condition you're working in right. But if it's warm. And it's dry this will be good in about 10 maybe 15 minutes. So you just want to double check as long as if it doesn't wipe off you can brush. And roll or spray. So no worries love this stuff all right. Now we're going to start with painting with the,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=473,"['What is the recommended method for taping off surfaces when working with acrylic paints?', 'Why is it important to have acetone available when painting a house?', 'How can you prevent paint from getting on flooring and windows during painting?', 'What is the best way to apply trim to finished flooring without damaging the floor?', 'What are some tips for achieving a smooth finish with acrylic paints?']"

Now we're going to start with painting with the brush okay if you're a fan of the channel you've maybe seen some of this information. But we're gonna go through it anyway angle brush three two. And a half whatever you're more comfortable with paint can get it empty to about here okay you want about an inch. And a half of paint. And you load up the brush. And then you clean off the outsides especially the trim okay the more you clean the more control you have. Now nothing's dripping there's no mess okay you can work in your good clothes. And when you're done your paint job you can go to sunday church not an issue all right start at the top. And work your way down okay. So you're gonna just set your brush. And then drag okay. And the goal here is not to get a perfect finish the first time the goal here is to get as little material as possible on there to get coverage okay. So you want to keep stretching it out if you're not stretching it out. Then you're leaving all the paint on the wood. And you're going to get ridges. And when you go do your second coat you'll do the same thing because that'll be your habit of painting. And you'll have too much paint hey you're going to waste a lot of money if you're not stretching it out. And really getting good coverage you're wasting your money gallon of paint nowadays good paint like this costs 60 70 bucks in the store. And you know it. So less is more okay you want to get some coverage out of this stuff. And then you work the top. And you drag okay. Now i've been using dulux for years i'm very familiar with their products. And i know which ones i love. And which ones i hate i also like some sherwin-williams stuff i like some stuff from benjamin moore i like stuff from ppg i like stuff from pittsburgh paint i like a company called c2 paint there's a lot of really good paints out there what separates them from everything that's holding the box store is quality if you go to the box store for your paint you're not going to find quality i it's just the way it is it's like every paint company out there has got their top of the line stuff right. And then they've got their decent stuff. And then their commercial. And all the garbage. And they brand all the garbage. And put it in the box store just being honest there's no way around it i don't care who you are if you have a problem with my opinion on that go ahead in the comments section blow it up let's have an argument or a conversation let's discuss the matter civilly. But the reality is my experience in the paint market there's a bunch of different paint companies just like there's a lot of different automotive makers okay. But in the paint world they make  everything from the introductory piece of crap all the way up to the lamborghini. And every paint company makes the same stuff high end all the way down to crap because they want to serve every market that they have walking through the door for whatever reason i think benjamin moore might. And c2 are the only stores that i'm really aware of that don't sell a real crap baseline right they don't sell a new home construction paint product line. But almost everybody else does. So you got to be careful when you go to the store you get what you pay for all right you can buy a 30 gallon of semi gloss trim paint. And you need two gallons to do the same work as one gallon of this because it covers. So much better one brush line three four feet of trim. And i cleaned it off think about it there really is you get what you pay for in the paint world. So don't be afraid to spend good money. But if you're gonna spend money have good technique. So you're not wasting your time because if you can paint in in one or two coats. But it would take three or four of a cheap paint all right you're buying extra material thinking you're saving on the gallon price. But using half the material with a good paint just saying that's also half the time brushing. So you save a lot of time as well all right. Now here we go. And then we pull all right here we are the reason i like to pull instead of go like this because we're not curling right we're just putting paint on. And we're just running it down all right getting even distribution the less of that slapping back. And forth of the brush the less paint is flying around the room the less cleanup afterwards you're going to thank me for that. So that's how we do this all right we do every part of the trim that we see all right there we go we get it on get control. And then we pull. And you stretch it as far as you can. Now this is latex paint. So we start the top work down if for any reason you're working with an oil start at the bottom. And pull it up okay it just performs better. Now you don't have to paint in the hinges. But you don't have to be careful not to paint the hinges either it's not going to affect your day okay just make sure you don't leave paint sitting in that crease you don't have issues closing your door pull pull pull this is the rule just keep on pulling all right. Now you can go up like that. And leave all kinds of paint in that corner right. And then you can just pull from it see that that guarantees you fill all that crack up with the paint when in doubt you got a texture or something that's causing a problem go across grain. And then you can pull it down whenever you find yourself having to go back the other way in order to get coverage it means you're running out of paint all right just keep on pulling. Now my brush is nice. And dry i'm going to go back. And clean up all the extra paint that i had sitting there okay. Now even with the good paint. And this technique of stretching it out. And pulling it you're trying to use as little amount of paint as possible to get your coverage all right. And that's how you avoid all the brush lines too much paint leaves brush lines it's like a snow plow driving down the street all the extra just gets pushed to the side same with the brush okay. So if you have too much paint. And you see lines when you see ridges like this it means somebody use way too much material okay there's enough paint here to paint the rest of this trim way too much material. And people who paint like that are throwing their money in the garbage. And getting a poor result okay there's still too much material here i'm just gonna just keep on dragging this down until i get it where i want it wow i really put a lot of paint on there you get an idea how much coverage you can get from just a little bit of paint right okay let's talk about the bottom,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=966,"['What type of paint is being used in this tutorial?', 'Why is it important to clean off the brush and trim before painting?', 'How does the technique of stretching and pulling work?', 'What happens if you use too much paint on a surface?', 'Why is it recommended to start at the top and work down when painting?']"

Now to paint the bottom you want to pretend you're painting a ceiling. So invert yourself. And paint the same way you get upside down. And now you start from the top. And you pull the paint away okay you don't even need to have tape here you just use the tip of the brush to push it towards the edge of the wood. And then you pull it away you're in control set the heel of the brush. And then pull it up same thing down here you're going to want to get right underneath the bottom with the tip all right. So when you set the brush. And then you apply pressure you push the bristles down you don't want to try to start at the edge okay get close push the bristles down. And then paint it okay that's it. And you can paint with incredible accuracy. And not even have to spend all your time taping everything up some people are going to argue that this is faster than using the sprayer. But next we're going to show you why i use the sprayer instead of a brush because whenever you're painting trim you're also painting doors that's where having the sprayer makes the biggest difference. So give me another two minutes i'll finish this up. And move on to the sprayer. And how that works all right. So real quick a lot of people are going to be asking in the comments section what kind of brush you use jeff because like you know i want to use a brush that jeff uses. And i'm like i use every kind of brush i see every time i see a brush for sale i've never used i buy it. And i try it here's what i've learned over all my years whether it's eight dollars or fifty dollars like the caroma i'm working with here they all do exactly the same job sorry to break anybody's bubble  i know a lot of painters get really under the color about this oh you gotta have a party if you're not using purdy purdy's not the best thing in the world okay. But it is a lexus it's a nice brush. But they also sell a purdy brush at the local building store that's not the same quality as the professional purdy brush. So how does a consumer how are you going to know do you hear a party is the best. And so you go to go to your local building store. And they're selling a purdy. And you buy it same company different product level different quality level don't spend 30 bucks on a brush at a local building store you're buying a 10 brush okay you're buying their name on a 10 brush i pretty may not be happy about that. But maybe if they weren't trying to deceive everybody with their name on a piece of crap i wouldn't have to tell everybody. So anyway feel free to buy a 10 brush go to your local sherwin-williams or dulux or benjamin moore say hey you got a 10 or 12 brush that's what i'm gonna buy i like a three inch angle that's my favorite i know lots of people who like a two. And a half that's fine too. But if you can carry a lot of paint. And you paint with this technique three makes everything. So much faster. And you can almost get one at the local dollar store the value of the brush really comes down to how often you're going to use it. And how long you want it to last. And how many times you can clean it without it falling apart okay as a homeowner if you're just doing a couple of rooms. And you want to buy a three dollar brush at the dollar store that's fine. But the hairs are going to come falling out while you're painting. So just pay attention to that. And wipe them off as you go. And you can do a three dollar brush if you're going to be painting or you know a lot for the rest of your life. Then invest in a brush that you can wash. And let dry. And it'll have it in perfect condition day after day after day after day. And you can have a brush like this last for a couple of years just saying it's worth the investment if you're going to be using it to make money all right. So the same can that i had here right i added just a touch of water i want about 10 water. And i'm just giving it a bit of a stir. Now you can't spray a  semi-gloss 100 acrylic paint without adding a little bit of water you got to thin it out just a touch okay it's going to look like junk as it hits the trim all right here we go wagner power,https://youtu.be/diBvKzJHjM0?t=1360,"['What type of brush does Jeff use for painting?', 'How does Jeff choose the best brush for his needs?', 'Why is Jeff not a fan of using Purdy brushes?', 'Can you buy a good quality brush at a local building store?', 'How often should you replace your paintbrush?']"

Now remember how much we got done with just a few brush fulls imagine that's actually a lot of paint right there when you think about it compared to a couple of brush fulls let's see how far this goes okay. So here we go we got our paint. And we're going to turn it on it's going to make a little bit of noise. And then i'm going to show you how this works the key here is to make sure that your flooring is all covered. So you don't have overspray we okay okay ah. So here's what we're learning here guys. And this is where experience comes in handy that's coming out too thick there's obviously not enough water in that mix to get a nice even spray. So i got to brush this in. Now real quick before i have a mess on my hands. And we're going to modify that. So that we don't have a problem. And we can we're starting on the frame for a reason because this is where you find out how your mix is working okay if it's too thick you can brush it in that's not a problem. But you want to get this fixed up before you go. And attack your doors all right here we go. Now that's just like any other brush. And roll day yeah not bad here we go okay let's thin it out a little bit more. And we'll try again okay. So first i'm going to clean out the line with the old stuff here let's give this a try. So we started with 10. Now i'm at 20 water all right [laughter] all right there we go that's pretty much the secret. And you don't want to spray until you see full coverage spray until you see about 80 coverage. And let the paint melt into each other okay it will do that you're seeing it. Now the streak the bubbly is all going melting into each other. Now that's brilliant all right.

Now that's brilliant all right. Now it's time for the doors we'll show you why i love having a spray gun for a door. And so for this demonstration what we're going to do is i'm going to spray the top half all right actually i'll spray the bottom half because it's easier i don't have to bend over. So much when i'm painting. And then i'm going to brush. And roll the top half. And you can get an idea of the difference in the work.

And using a mini roller little four inch with a microfiber roll okay i know a lot of people like to use a sponge roller when they're working with smooth surfaces. But i like to just buy a good quality paint. And then let the texture melt itself out. And in this situation with the brush. And the roller less is more with the sprayer you're going to find a little bit more is better. Now obviously if you're using a sprayer. And you're going to resort to the wagner power sprayer on a door what you're going to find is that because it's blowing air with the paint there's going to be a texture there's going to be a little more eggshell to it. And that's fine if that's the look you're going for just make sure you're consistent. But if you want to have a nice smooth finish. Then using a roller. And stretching out your paint. And going that less is more concept is going to give you a better look personally i'm not a big fan of that. So i'm going to roll that in. But all i'm doing is working out the texture okay. So you can spray the whole door. And then come back. And roll this all in nothing wrong with doing that at all all right. Now with the ruler with finish paint  a lot of doors out there are what we call six panel. So you're gonna have all these different squares you have a lot more brushing. And rolling the bigger the flat area the smoother you want this finished texture okay that means the less material you want on your paint roller all right you'll also get a benefit if you set up a couple saw horses. And laid that lay the slab flat. So that the gravity is melting the paint together in this situation because it's standing up it's all sagging. So you got to be really careful not to use too much paint it's always easier to do a second or a third coat if you need to. And use less paint okay there's just never anything wrong with that. And if you find after your first or second coat you've got little bits of junk okay grab the sanding sponge if there's too much texture in your paint grab the sanding sponge okay it's always your best interest between coats to make sure that you are completely happy all right. And try to do three or four three or four sides every time okay a door has six sides. So the first time you roll do both of the sides. And across the top next time you turn it around flip it upside down. And roll the bottom if you seal all the sides of the door your doors are less likely to warp especially if they're subject to the different levels of humidity throughout the year okay that'll help to keep your doors functioning properly year-round okay well that's it right just remember sand in between coats clean your surfaces get every part of it done. And then when you screw it all back together your hinges will be clean. And everything will be perfect that's money in the bank okay.

So just to recap in most cases when you're painting doors. And trim less is more right always sand always prep there's more work that goes into a quality paint job when you're not holding the brush than when you are right remember when you're painting the inside of your house the average home  20 to 40 gallons of paint ceilings walls trims. And doors do the whole inside of your house get five percent increase in the value of your whole house okay that's a lot of money. And it's not a huge investment because in a lot of cases the the paint for a whole house you know the the ceiling paint the wall paint it's a lot less money than it is for the doors. And trim it's affordable it's a diy project you can afford to do yourself dress up your house make it beautiful. And earn some money while you're at it. And if you want to see that wagner power sprayer in action we actually used it on another project where we painted. And stained the brick at the new location of the church check out the video here if you haven't seen it it's amazing because when you're spraying something with texture a cheap sprayer like that goes a long long way.

And as you can see this tiles look plain nasty ron please come help us decide exactly what we want to do with this kitchen ceiling i need your help run i can't do this myself please you sure it does you know i just couldn't refuse in a feel like that. So i hopped in my truck. And drove over to visit the language at their home in danbury connecticut see what we've got you guys fresh muffins well ron here it is wow what happened up there oh it's just major plumbing leak you know this is what water does to the ceilings a little repair over here you try it yeah i try to patch it up. And it it just didn't take. So what are you thinking for replacement something that's a no more in keeping with the character of the house something not drywall i'm not really interested in that. But i'm really not sure where we're gonna go with this something with a pattern or a texture or something like that yeah yeah i think i think have you guys thought about stamped metal ceiling you know they actually still make them really that that sounds very nice have you got a computer absolutely okay show you something online. Now this is a company that still makes those stands middle ceilings i've been doing this for a hundred years wow look at all those yeah that's incredible these are all metal huh these are all metal all stamped metals. So why don't you look through there just see anything catch your eye here i like this one right there i do like this number 209 right there that's fantastic just spent some time look through here when you've picked out the one you want once you go ahead. And order it okay. And when the material gets here i'll come back. And we'll put it up that looks great absolutely it's gonna look really good. And i have a feeling because it's about 2 by 4 foot panels this is gonna go up fairly quickly i hope. So yeah ii do know before we start on this though we got to take the old ceiling down okay. And that's gonna get a little bit messy.

Then fiona makes a final check with a voltage tester before the two of them disconnect the wiring. And remove the fixture [music]. So these first these are the ones that you took down before right. Now the first tiles to come down are the ones richard put up with screws when he repaired the water damage the remaining tiles are nailed in place. And all that's required to bring them down is a good tug within minutes that tiles are off exposing the furring strips.

And ceiling joists next we begin removing the crown molding first we score along the edge to keep from chipping the paint. And then tap in wide putty knives to protect the wall finally we use pry bars to work the trim loose the last part of our demolition has us taking down the old furring strips to which the original tiles were attached. Now we thought about trying to reuse these they weren't located in the right places for our new panels [music] well i'd say you've got the lodge look. Now huh maybe we should just leave it this way you know you gain a little ceiling height just a little too rustic i think these the panels are gonna go up there that we saw earlier. Now in order for this seems to really work out nicely on this to stay straight. And flat we've got to put an on flat surface. So the next thing i want to do is just check the bottom of these ceiling joists to see if in fact there's any kind of bow in them. So rich airs my four foot level of the fuel tank on the end turns into my 8 foot level very nice okay in this case we're gonna use it enough. So much as a level. But a straight edge okay. So put it on the bottom of this joist right here -huh. Now you see we've got a gap in there at the end yeah i do see it yeah how much is it like 3/4 of an inch about that yeah we'll compensate for this variation later on when we put up the new furring strips our first furry strips will be sent around the perimeter of the room a couple of inches from the wall a chalk line gives us our reference point lock it in [music] all right well the perimeter is done. Now we can start to put these furring strips in the center [music]. Now we've got our fern strips up next thing is to make sure that they're perfectly flat. So to do that we're gonna use believe it or not a piece of string if you would go down to that corner down there you'll find a nail down there. And just slip the loop over the nail see right here the board. And the string or even. But if you come down this way there's a gap that opens up between the string. And the board the board is actually almost a quarter of an inch higher right here. So we have to do is bring the furring strip down. So that it's at the same level with the string how are we going to do that right we're going to do that using shims or wedge-shaped pieces of wood wherever we need to lower the furring strips we loosen the screw. And tap in the shim the further the shim goes in the more the furring strip moves downward our furring strips are up. And flat.

And slipped into place the second section is cut on an angle the angle section simply slips over the first this is often called a coping joint each straight corner section is overlapped with the next.

Now just. So that you're all aware of what's going on here i'm doing a complete bathroom remodel i'm doing seven videos on this. So this is one of the series of that seven if you want to watch the rest of those video check out the video description you get the links to watch this whole series don't forget to give us a thumbs up if you like learning how to do things that make your house worth more money that you can do yourself just to make this interesting i've chosen the most difficult situation in the home. And you'll be able to watch this. And go wow that wasn't that tricky i'm using engineered hardwood it's a floating floor okay no fasteners no adhesives it just sits by the miracle of gravity. Now you've got to use the right products. And procedures. So we're going to go through that the reason this is tricky is because this floor is heated that's right this is a heated floor. And i've got a system to install floating floor over top of the heated floor that actually works for any kind of surface step number one you're going to want to cut. And remove all your baseboards that's simple grab yourself an olen knife if you don't have an olen knife go to the store. And buy one or just use our amazon links in the video description. And grab one of these okay these are amazing. And what you're doing here is you're cutting the cocking. But even more than that you're cutting the paper okay. So that if you if you tear it when you're taking off the baseboard it doesn't go above the knife line okay that's what you're just cutting right through into the paper one thing you want to make sure you do when you're taking baseboards off is don't increase your scope of work this is a 5-in baseboard we're going to go back with a 5. And 1/2 the idea is if i cut through the paper instead of that  i eliminate the risk of the cocking pulling the drywall paper off the surface i don't have to patch. And prime. And repair all right i just stick the new baseboard on. And i'm good to go going to grab my trusty red bar all right see how that works you're never going to increase your damage the cocking grabbed the paper here. But only went down because i cut through the drywall had i not cut through that drywall paper it would have peeled all the way up the walls. And pulled it off that just add would have added hours of work to the day step one done all right step two is sweep. And scrape cuz you don't know the condition of your house you might have chunks of mud or cement there could be just about anything attached to your flooring. So you want to try to create as completely smooth. And clean surface as you can. And you just kind of go along here like you're raking your yard after the leaves. And the fall fall down inspecting every square inch one of the biggest mistakes people make is they they don't clean enough before they start. And then while they're working they've got to stop. And find the tools again. And then bend down. And scrape again. And then they got to get the vacuum to clean it up properly it can really slow you down. So really go over the whole work area i'm going to be installing flooring up to here. And then i'm going to transition i'm going move the saw to the other side of the room here we go step three is vacuum okay it's not good enough to sweep dirt is your enemy whenever you're doing a flooring job you really want to get into all all those nooks. And crannies where you remove the baseboard. And make sure all that debris is gone you'd be surprised how much dirt is going to be moving around the room as you're dropping the boards. And moving around. So you want to just try to suck it all clean as much as you can before you start laying your flooring are you going to get dirt caught underneath your floor. And it's going to make noise every time you walk on it [music] here's a quick tip when you have a big groove like this okay. And you've got your vacuum up against it if it's not sucking up the debris just take a finger on each side. And close off the ability for the air to increase the vacuum pressure. And that'll suck up just about anything okay step three is underlayment all right especially with the heated floor you got to be careful which under layment you choose there's plenty of them on the market. Now this one is the one that i chose. And believe it or not i know i'm always giving home depot a hard time for the some of the quality of the products they carry. But this particular product was actually available at home depot in the united states. And if you want to know what it is. And the benefits of it it's actually quite simple i'm going to throw a link in the video description we're going to do a video specifically on this product. And answer on all these questions okay. But this product here has got a lot of different properties you're going to want to check that video out understand is it the right product for you because i've given other recommendations in the past about using 3mm evm. But you can't use that over top of a heated floor. So there's a lot of information in that video going to suggest you check it out. But with all kinds of hard surface over another floor i suggest using an underlayment because it makes it quieter as a first first benefit. And if you buy the right product you get a lot more value out of the installation than you do by spending a lot more money on high quality flooring. So installing most floating floors are as simple as having a tape measure. And a pencil okay you really just want to make sure you follow the next couple rules rule number one leave a/ quarter inch gap around the whole room for expansion contraction all right rule number two make sure that all your finishing trims are going to finish on top of your flooring. So over here coming out of the bedroom i actually scribed it earlier. So i can slide my first piece underneath. And that is a a perfect finish. Now remember when you're cutting around things just marking by eye works really well. But then use a square to draw your lines to cut with okay okay. Now you know that's the piece i'm cutting out if you're working with somebody who's helping you. And you got both follow the same process it's easy to mark. And then identify what the cut off is. So step number five of course installing the flooring means you need to have some cutting tools depending on the material you're going to have a variation. So you could have a chop saw like this a sliding miter saw you can have a jiga a lot of the vinyl floors out there you can cut with a utility knife. But only these straight lines when in doubt if you're not sure. And you don't want to spend a fortune in tools if you buy one jigs you can cut any kind of hard surface floor laminate engineered hardwood or vinyl. And you can do every single cut with one tool. And this is like about 50 or 60 bucks of course you're going to sacrifice a little bit of quality with your cuts okay. And most materials respond the same the solution is we install the the baseboard at the end. And it'll cover all that damage. But if you can get your hands on a saw like this it's much faster [music] work just use a knife to clean out the corners ready to go there we go almost all of these products install the same put in an angle. And then they click lock together there we go when you hear that sound you know you've got it right here we are the product invariably especially with wood comes in different sizes right. So you're going to want to sort through it make sure. So you're being creative with your joints if you had the same joint every second board all the way through the room it's going to look very interesting one of the reasons you use wood is because wood comes in different lengths. So you can take your off cuts keep them handy. And always use them to finish off the rows [music] here we are it's a good example of just mixing up where the locations are if you have 6 in from one joint to the next you're always going to be fine. And happy with the way it looks when you're measuring for the remainder just take the board the direction it's facing turn it around. Now that's your finished edge that goes right here press it up against the wall. And then subtract the/ quinch gap that you want here we go mark. And cut it save the piece to start another row later on or take a few inches off. So you can move your your joint to a different location i'm going to save this one for later you can see there's not a lot of skill involved in doing this the only thing you really got to be concerned about is making sure your joints are staggered okay as long as you're staggering your joints you're going to be really happy with your end result all right. So i'm going to just race through the rest of this room. And get this all done give this video a thumbs up if you like the idea of learning how to do remodeling projects in your home that you can do yourself with just minimal tools. And really increase the value of your property that is the secret. And it's money in the bank in this video i'm going to teach,https://youtu.be/WQI6ZTrfq4Q?t=81,"['What type of flooring can be installed over a heated floor?', 'Why is it important to remove baseboards before installing new flooring?', 'How does one create a smooth and clean surface for installing flooring?', 'What are some benefits of using an underlayment with a heated floor?', 'How do you stagger joints when installing floating hardwood flooring?']"
706.0,2317.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,How to Remodel A Bathroom on a Budget | A to Z,WQI6ZTrfq4Q,How to Remodel A Bathroom on a Budget | A to Z: Install A Toilet,61c16400-61f4-1ac7-cc83-566f4c00d593,It's money in the bank in this video i'm going to teach you everything you need to know. So that you can change your toilet. And install a new one even if you're changing the height of your floor stay tuned all right guys one of the most important things you need to learn about managing your house is managing the water specifically with your toilet there are at least well there's at least one toilet for every person living in north america right we're toilet crazy we got them at home we got them at work we got them where we eat we got them where we play got them in the park bottom line is there's a about a billion toilets floating around north america. And on a regular basis they need to be removed. And changed the sizes change styles change used to have like huge tanks right be enough water in there to fill a swimming pool. But now we're getting really low flow. And trying to conserve. So everybody's updating toilets we're going to go through the process for doing this first thing you got to do is shut off the water supply in the back i am lucky because i have a 90° turn shut off valve. And then remove these things these things are brutal a lot of times people try to move their toilet. And then they want to reinstall it later cuz they're doing a renovation. And if you don't manage this it breaks really easily. So you got to put it somewhere safe thanks matt yeah. Now that the water's off you got to empty the sucker all right empty out the back. Now this is called the tank. And this is a one piece toilet. So we don't have any risk of leakage here. But if it's a two-piece especially make sure that you've emptied out the back. And you check to make sure that the two screws. And bolts that are there are tight. And nothing's wiggling around okay managing your water here is really the key if you don't manage the water that's in the toilet when you move it because it is a pe trap if you look at an old toilet you'll see the pipe come down. And up okay there's a big snake here. And the water actually sits in the bowl all the way down. And all the way back up again until it spills over the top to go down to the through the floor. So that's the p trap here just like underneath the sink if you leave all that water in there as you move it splashes over the top wall okay. And it ends up all over your floor. So what i got a system here to help you do this. So you're not going to run in trouble first of all get a pil of water because it's a p trap if i pour a large volume of water down at a quick time creates a vacuum. And it'll suck all the water out of that pet trap almost to the very end check this out. So the water level used to be here. Now it's down here. So that means on the back side of that p trap that's in here i've got a few inches to play with that's enough for me to manage you no need to go grab a vacuum. And shove your vacum in a toilet. And get it full of bacteria god just do that. And and. Then follow the following process you want to disengage your water supply from your shut off valve couple of turns it should be just fingertight. Now you're going to get a dribble here don't panic it's just a little bit of water in that hose okay secondly all toilets have some sort of connection system to the floor in this case there's this little cap. And a screw. And there's something on the floor that's attached to the floor inside the the back of the toilet that that screws into okay there's all kinds of systems out there. Now be careful. And pay attention to which one you have if you have a traditional toilet it's just going to be the white caps with toilet bolts you might even need a hacksaw to cut those bolts off depending on the condition of the toilet this toilet looks to be grouted. And silicone to the floor if you've never seen that before consider it because the grout offers you a lot of stability. And the silicone gives you a great seal look at that there we go what do you mean it was grouted to the floor that mean well the toilet was installed. And then grout was pushed into the groove into the right. And then what it does is it gives it stability. So it doesn't rock it's very common when you're working on uneven surfaces mhm because instead of using  silicone shims you can just grout it in oh yeah big deal come back the next day a little bit of silicone off you go all right. Now she's ready to be released okay. So what we're going to do is we're going to lift this up matthew is going to bag it behind me. And take it out of the way i' like putting something like this straight into a shower pan unfortunately today because we're using lights we can't get to the shower pan. So we'll set it behind us the reason for the bags in case there's any water pouring dripping out we keep it contained okay. Now we're also going to get a chance to see the condition of the seal on this toilet. And we'll talk about that. And we'll discuss option to make this work we haven't done this in a little while yeah this one's a difficult one cuz there nothing to grab here you're getting it up in the air i have nothing to grab here yeah. So i'm going to grab the back corner. And the front edge right here. And i'm just going to wrap it okay ready all right i'm trying to lift it up level there we go okay this right down yeah all right. Now at this point if you can just get more bag towards the back okay. And then rock it forward rock it forward a little bit there we go okay that's good. Now slide that right over easy easy easy in case you yeah okay well that one worked really well i like that system. So this particular toilet came with a whole flange nut. And bolt system look at that who installed that look at that not even a drip of water no wax there's a lot of options out here for doing this kind of work. So what i'm going to do. Now is let's take this apart. And we'll show you different options. So this is actually a pretty advanced toilet it's  going to be rather expensive to buy these about 4 or 500 bucks here's the deal traditional toilets don't come with a system like this okay for connection that's where the screws went into isn't that amazing let's get something back to what it looks like a little bit more traditional okay. So this particular toilet comes with installation instructions for this unit right here. And this one sits on the wax all right. And it's just a really traditional wax ring. But the toilet itself is designed differently okay. So here we go this is all special installation for that particular unit this is traditionally what you're going to find. So here's the wax ring that you would buy that i used in this situation all right. And it is 1 in thick okay. And it gets compressed. And it makes a really good seal. And you can see it is no longer 1 in thick all right. Now the reason that it fits. So well. And it didn't leak anywhere is because the height of this flange versus the the to the tile here i'm a big believer in the idea of this the top of your flange needs to be at bare minimum flush with your finished floor or a/ quart of an inch higher. And anywhere in that range okay. Now on this particular floor it has a slight slope look at this almost flush at the back okay full quarter of an inch higher than the floor in the front all right. And that's why this works cuz i use a regular wax if it was lower i would have want to bought this okay this is the large version of the wax same product one. And a half times as thick okay. So if you have a toilet that's really flush with the floor i wouldn't suggest going with the regular wax get the jumbo reinforced flange g wax okay get the jumbo. And that'll help make sure that you get good compression into the wax. Now let me just go through a couple of things here when you pull this one out of the package okay the jumbo wax there is a possibility that you can screw this up if you have  good gap here if you have a nice gap here. And you get the jumbo wax you have the potential of doing something like this you're going to go like this you're going to drop your wax in place right you're going to line up your bolts you're going to go to set the toilet in if when you go to set the toilet in you're not all the way where you want to be. So you're going straight down on it okay you're not going to get good compression what possibly could happen is you could start here. And then you might start moving backwards okay. And you get in position you think oh great i got a good seal what you've done is you've collapsed your hole okay. And you end up just going to do the demonstration here i've seen this before many times we'll get a call from a customer they're like this is back in the days when i worked warranty for a renovation company. And it open open up the toilet. And i'd see something like this all right instead of a nice big 3-in hole they got this all right that looks like the size of a drain for the sink you're going to run into trouble. So you don't want to be forcing the wax back or sliding it left. And right when you drop your toilet on you want to be over top foot go straight down if that means you need two or three people to help you. Then get them okay. But you've got to make sure you go straight down on your wax to avoid that trouble all right garbage okay here we go. So i'm going to set this aside cuz i'm going to use this one later to reinstall this toilet let me just go through a couple of other options you all might have seen this before. And i used this on a toilet in my did a a bathroom video max in my my fors downstairs yeah. And downstairs we had  oh this this place the floor downstairs is over a crawl space. And the crawl space is really short. And it's old school 1880 construction. So the flooor has a lot of movement. And so what we did down there to solve our toilet problem is i had the toilet flange sitting on the plywood. And then we had flooring. And because of the height of the flooring i had to add some beef to it we put in this rubber gasket here okay. And goes over the holes. And this rubber gasket replaces the need for wax okay. So then what happens is the toilet sits on this. And as the house moves. And breathes. So does the gasket see that. So if the toilet is moving around in position all year round with different seasons the gasket maintains contact with the toilet. And have a good seal wax doesn't do that once wax is pushed. And collapsed it does not spring back in place. So if you have an older house or you're on a crawl space. And you get weird weather having a foam gasket like this might be a good solution for you this was available at home depot if you want to search it out we'll put the   i'll put a link i think i might be available on amazon closet flange extension okay. And it also comes with a flange extender. Now this ring is going to be for a good for this situation here check this out we are adding new flooring. Now look what happens all of a sudden the flange is lower than my finished floor okay you don't want that cuz if i put this on here with that lower than that my toilet is not even going to make contact with that flange okay okay that's a serious problem make sure you've always got that at least flush or/ qu inch higher. So what they do is they sell this little extension kit okay boom boom boom here we go always set this up. So your bolts are when you're looking at it like a clock face you're at 3:00. And 9:00 nice. And square. And level don't go like this or the toilet might have a potential to to pop right out of the holes okay. Now you're high enough that might even be a little bit too high okay. But what you want to do is you want to screw these four corners right into the existing abs drain system okay. So i have abs drain you might be on a cpvc if it's on cast you can't use this you can't use this extender on cast okay they have a different one. And that's a whole new world most people in the world were not on cast plumbing anymore because extended toilet bolt kits as well because when you start building up your toilet kit you might not have bolts long enough to get above the new toilet when you start stacking all this together all right. So all three of these things work together to get an extension. And a seal let me get these out of the damn way okay there we go extension seal. And in between this is a gasket under compression. And it seals everything okay that's why we're screwing it down to create compression don't use silicone i've seen. So many plumbers use silicone. And throw on a teflon ring it's lazy it's wrong it always leaks anywhere where you have water sitting silicone will give out. And eventually cuz a toilet should sit there for the lifetime of the of the room we don't reinstall them every year to get a fresh seal. But if you have any silicone in that assembly water will get underneath between that silicone. And it'll start working its way out onto your subfloor rot out your subfloor. And when your subfloor starts to rot rot around your toilet all your screws are in rotting wood. And so the wood swells. And then everything starts to get loose. And then your toilet starts to wiggle. And as your toilet wiggles the wax starts to open up worse. And worse. And worse next thing you know the wax is broken the water's all around the toilet this is what happens it can take 5 or 10 years. But so don't let somebody install a toilet incorrectly in your house because the warranty they're going to give you on that installation is 30 days to a year tops right. But the damage they can cause by doing it wrong will bite you in the butt years down the road you'll be sitting there going jeez honey there's a really weird dark stain on the ceiling what's up with that somebody use silicone on your toilet all right. Now the next option is this product here okay it's very similar. Now this one comes this one has two different thicknesses. And rings okay. So this is my go-to anytime that i know i need an extension. But i'm not sure how big it's going to be cu i haven't pulled the toilet off yet i buy one of these okay there's two gaskets that come with it there's an adhesive backing on it okay the adhesive backing is to apply to the underside of the ring you going to set that up bam right. Now you're ready to go extension right. Now the reason i like this particular system is like i said it's it's got the screws. So i can screw in four corners the other thing it has is this bolt system doesn't allow it to slide out okay. So you can put these in the right location. And then you stack it like this. Then you would screw it in okay. Now when you're going to go install your toilet they have these clips check this out little plastic washers it's kind of like a zip tie okay. And you can get your bolt standing straight up by using that zip tie remember what i said about setting your toilet straight down if you use this system here you can line this up perfectly. And as an individual you can set that on if you don't have those these bolts can be all over the place making contact with the toilet. And you got to lean. And slide. And try to you need two people. But with this it's a one person installation very common out there is the existing floor if you're adding tile. Then you you know you have to get 1. And a/4 inch thick on your subf flor. So what we do is we don't move the flange we add the plywood around it we got a great video that we added the subfloor okay if you're doing a project like that. And you need to add subfloor thickness we'll put a video link in the description or you can check the card if you get cards on your notification the other thing is when you go that thick on your tile you take the the seal okay boom double stack this bad boy okay good to go. Now when you do your screws you screw through here they they're already lined up boom boom boom all the way down into the abs. Now you've got enough height difference here to add plywood. And tile. And still have a little bit sitting above your floor okay guaranteed every time if you're doing a tile job. And you're going from  just regular subf floor because you had vinyl sheet floor go back to the original 58 get that little quar inch plywood out of there grab one of these kits. And double stack it all right. And then you can install your toilet knowing that you're going to have a great seal. And depending on the thickness like i said you can go with a regular wax if you are a little bit above your floor when you're finished or you can go with the large wax when you're done all right one more thing when you're doing your toilet day make sure you pop by your local coffee shop grab yourself a coffee these are like wax lined cups perfect every time that'll stop the sewer gas from coming into the house while you're working this information is really good for anybody who has cpvc or or abs plumbing all right  if you have cast you can actually buy brass rings if sometimes the cast you still have lead the lead is a soft metal that's sticking up. And you can actually just take a torch to it really lightly. And then you can hammer it flat okay i know it's crazy. And then you can put your adhesive right over top of that. And then bolt your toilet to the floor there's a few other varying situations. But they also make a  flange insert that goes into that pipe. And it's called twist. And seal all right it's a white pvc has a big 3-in black gasket on it. And the sides are tapered the idea is you set it in place. And you start spinning it. And the the contact that the the gasket has with the side of the pipe slowly starts to get compressed tighter. And tighter. And tighter as you thread it down. So if you have an old pipe. And you don't have a flange. And you've got nothing attached to that twist. And seal will save your bacon okay. So it is on the market all of these things are available your local building store you don't have to go to specialty supply store for this that's the best part when in doubt if you have an issue take a picture of what you're you're dealing with get a measurement of whatever your finish is from your floor know your flooring assembly you're going to be using you can go to the hardware store. And they'll help you get the right stuff okay they're at least competent enough to help you with that most plumbing departments at these stores you've got someone who has enough confidence to help you with your toilets h. And if you have other questions. And you just can't seem to solve your problem consider becoming a member on our channel we've got a forum you can send pictures. And ask questions there. And we can help you out ourselves okay. So in summary let's just go through the the major points here one don't ever use silicone if you have to rely on silicone to seal your water you're just delaying the damage that's inevitable number two try to get flush to a quarter inch up okay if you're a/ quarter in high it's perfect regular wax is good. And if you need to build it up use the system that's that's designed for building it up don't get creative in your home. And experiment all right. And number three always install your toilet straight down when you're finished. And you'll be just fine remember one of the most common causes of water damage in the home is a leaking toilet it's unbelievable i've probably replaced in 500 toilets on my career. And i'll tell you right. Now about 430 of them were installed wrong. So if you're watching this video chances are yours is too the way you can tell is if it moves side to side or front to back you got a 95% chance that there's a leak going on right. Now you might want to take it up. And have a good look okay if you like that information. And you think it saved your bacon give this video a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to this channel because we are in the middle of a massive bathroom remodel project we're doing everything bought from the local building store. So that you guys can do this project at home on your own okay it's going to be totally doable yes you can remodel your bathroom. And you can make a ton of money doing it. So now that we got our fling installed let's take a look at the actual implementation of the solution here we'll start off by going with a thick ring. Now you're going to see that maybe that's allowable on the back because i have a slope floor. And a level fixture  i'm way too thick at the front. So that's not going to be acceptable remember this is going to be sitting on the floor. So i can't have something that's causing this to be sitting too high off the ground or that's just going to be a serious problem for me here we go this is the thinner piece okay i'm just above flush here maybe an eighth. And i'm a quarter in front i like that we're going to go with it you know it's funny because you know most toilets don't have an elaborate system like this this has an integrated rubber gasket here that the toilet actually is going to stretch. And have its own self-seal. And i'm using wax to seal this to my my fl majority of toilet toilets that are on the market today are basically they're cheap they don't have you know expensive flange options there's a lot of different companies out there who sell four six $800 toilets. And they have really complex systems to manage the fact that it'll never leak. But the average person is getting a builder grade toilet or they're going to a box store to find a toilet to replace what they have. Now and they just don't sell quality there. So you have to contend with the fact that your installation has to be bloody perfect to protect yourself here there's just no mercy for you wow that'd be nice if they weren't quite. So aggressive if when you put your flange on. And you're over gaps or screws. And you can't use the pre-drilled holes don't worry about it all right just reposition i know this ain't sexy. But it's going to get [music] done okay yeah just cuz it works doesn't mean it's easy h all right. Now this is just nasty dealing with these wax rings if you want you can wear latex gloves if you can get to even find them due to co it's hard to get a hold of products like that at the hardware store nowadays. So wear some clothes that you can rub your hands on. And get rid of the wax all right. Now that's in position next couple of steps got to happen pretty darn quick here all right we do not want to be smelling our sewer system thank you timmy for your help it's just wax. But you don't want to have too much buildup on the inside. And make your hole smaller right all right. Now here we go it's amazing. Now with most conventional toilets all you do is is you put the wax down attach your screws. And drop your toilet right over top with this system i have to go grab a wrench. Now but i got to install this coupling i got to install this system over top. And then tighten my [music] screws. So you can see that the nut sits on top of these brass washers when the washers start to bend you're putting more pressure on that toy than the you need to okay that's your key you don't know when to stop you want to know how much pressure as soon as this nut starts to bend that washer. And so folding into the hole just stop you've got enough pressure you're not doing any more favor to yourself by going any tighter all right well. Now i'm just going to drop the toilet in place. And connect the water supply again cutting the bolts down because i don't want to have any interruption with setting that new one on top boom this particular toilet what's that for that's where this goes okay that's where the screw the screw to set this in goes. So when you're going to go set the toilet down put the hole right in the middle of that tape. And then set it down i'll bend to the left you go to the right i know it's seems silly. But straight over okay okay i'm good me too there you go it just sits right in [music] place put a little decorative cap on there that looks pretty connect our water supply shut up valves always start with fingertight. And when it gets stiff you know you've made contact with the gasket that's in there okay. Then you can take app pliers give it another full turn maybe a fourth turn. And a half really gets good compression okay check for leaks we're good. And remember whenever you're doing a remodeling project. And you're adding new flooring if your plumm is coming through the floor you don't have to cut it off. And put on a new shut off valve just work your flooring around that hole get yourself one of these this is called a split pipe flange okay this will cover up the pipe. And it snaps in place. And you just set it there good to go perfect every time here we go guys. Now listen very careful when you put the you don't want to at the last moment when you have a full tank of water crack the darn tank in this video today guys we,https://youtu.be/WQI6ZTrfq4Q?t=706,"['What is the most common cause of water damage in a home?', 'How do I choose the right flange for my toilet installation?', 'Can I use silicone as a sealant for my toilet?', 'Why is it important to install toilets straight down?', 'What are some options for managing water in a toilet during installation?']"

And we're going to take it from this to this i know it's not much to look at right. Now but the tub is actually fantastic jetted tub we're just going to peel off all the trims get some proper substrate in behind it get some tile on the walls. And then we're also going to remove this here. And build a new half half wall i'm going to have the  tub faucet for this coming out of the wall it's a beautiful new fixture we'll show you all about that later. And how to install it we'll do the plumbing. And everything. But right. Now what i got to do is peel this onion apart. And find out right back to the original integrated tile flange of the tub. So then i can rebuild properly all right i've already got the water off downstairs. So we're going to open up the line. And all we're going to get is air. So there's a little bit of water coming out of the line. But generally i'm just allowing air in here i opened up a faucet on the main floor. So now the lines are all busy being drained that's what we want because we're going to get this removed off the floor too. So while that's draining we're going to just peel this open looks like just brad nails nose adhesives that's great news for me oh yes love trusting in silicones. And ceilings you know if they're sitting in water they never hold this is the problem with most of the showers. And tub systems in the world today 95% of the system systems that are out there that they're selling you require silicone to be the waterproofing. And it never never holds you know you're going to have a temporary shower if you buy something that needs silicone to keep it from getting wet let see how much mold we're going to get back here not bad wow that's surprising actually let's have a look at this. Now should just lift out. And lay down i'm not sure how in the hell i can't remember how i did that i must have had a hole open from the ceiling down beneath okay well it looks like i'm going to cut a hole in the ceiling. Then what to do what to do what to do like there we go okay it was just wedged in. And that is what i need right there okay. Now i can cut that line. And cap them. And then it'll be a little freer to work around here down getting plumbing materials i figured might as well enough supplies to sink a ship maybe we'll get lucky. And be able to rroo it right up into this wall cavity while we're at it. Now this is one of these situations you want to have paper towels with you if we can avoid having to cut open the ceiling downstairs that'll save me another four or five hours or to work. So we're going to just be slow. And gentle here there's two things we have to avoid if that line drops out below beneath the floor here. Then i'm not going to be able to  have access to it all right this weighs a couple of pounds all right that ought to keep it where it is we'll get the copper ring on it if we can all right. So even if that falls down. Now it's not going to be a problem okay step one all right at least we can put it finish the flooring. Now now i've got to figure out if i have enough flexibility to get enough of that line into this cavity well this is going to get messy i'm taking my watch off all right. So here's the plan yeah i need to be able to reach in. And hold the pipe cut it. And then cap it with my thumb right away drop the cutters. And then pull the old line out. So they don't get water everywhere cuz there's water sitting in that line from here it goes down. And then back up. So that's like a p trap for water. Now i don't want that water going into anywhere else yeah we are going to have water ladies. And gentlemen there's just no way around it. So what i'm going to do i'm going to create a spill catcher and i'm going to lay this on this drywall for the ceiling these absorbent towels ought to catch whatever drippy mess i make i'm going to get that in here even if the drywall gets a little wet it'll still dry there just not enough room in here for two hands okay okay i got most of it yeah i'll be able to put an elbow on that. And crimp it okay okay on this cutter it's starting to get old it's been ding dinged up in my toolbox too much. So it doesn't cut very nice without crushing the pipe which is why i'm having trouble. Now and i should answer this question while i'm here get this question a lot about  these rings versus the pinch cl s. So this system was out a long time ago all right. And basically it's just a ring. And and there's a tool that pinches this they work great if it's pinched properly okay. And if it fails it's going to fail right away. So you got to pressurize your lines before you move forward because you just don't know there's  it's an overlap system right here. So the bridge. So it's if it doesn't pinch right. And and it. And it comes off this little nub here that's sticking through is just it'll blow right off that's why i like the solid rings the solid rings never fail unless you forget to crimp them. So if you're doing plumbing in your own home. And you want to know which system is better solid rings by a mile used to be that these tools are $1 $150. But now you can get them for 30 bucks two more. And we'll get on with the demo knowing our plumbing is taken care of we're going to just put our c in here cool thing about these caps you see the tabs on the side it's like a depth stopper okay. So you can ring bring the ring right up to make contact with it where's he going here we go here we go that's where you install it that pushed all the way down. And lift it up to contact perfect every time you don't even have to think about it okay. And it's the same gap for every other crimp that you're going to do about 1/4 in from the end of the pipe all right okay. So this is all silicone let's just grabbing the dirt all right make sure your blade is nice. And clean you got to remove it  new silicone will not bond to old silicone got to always remove it. And not just the bulk of it i mean if there's a skim that thin little layer here that's all it takes for the notot to be a bond okay it's got to come off. And then even at that there's still a little bit of something there right. Now they make silicone removers. And you paint them on. And you brush them on. And then you let it sit there for a while. And you rub it off. But if you've got a ton of silicone sitting there it'll take you weeks to do that process. So get a good blade get it nice. And make sure it's sharp make sure it's flat okay make sure you're nice. And low. And get underneath all that old stuff. And a lot of cases like this when i'm doing a re a resurfacing. And i'm changing the silicone out i'm also having the tub glazed again. So i'm not concerned about if i put a little hair scratch in it or something right. And i'm also taking it off where i'm planning on putting silicone again. So even the smaller scratches are going to get covered by the new bead of silicone yeah it's the same process same glazing no matter what kind of tub you have steel acrylic porcelain doesn't matter be good. So once we're done all the tile if you want to do a a reglazing program call up the lo local reglazing okay or tub glazing people. And they'll just tell you over the phone. And say just don't put any silicone on until after we've glazed okay cuz whatever they're using bonds to old silicone residue okay. And then you're going to have a new surface. And then you can you can  all of your tub to the tile right. So just do it in the right order you'll be just fine this is a great tool i think it's a husky brand is it yeah it's a brad nail remover when you're doing a demolition the best time to remove nails is right away okay don't leave it. And be really thorough if you leave one nail inevitably someone comes along do mutter cocking. And hits the nail it can damage your tool it can slice your fingers open. So make sure you have your electrical tape handy not easy what it be possible all right well here's the solution to our problems cardi board right/ inch it's the same thickness as your drywall  i'm going to put it on the back down the side all across the front i'm going to replace this. And i'm going to take the first 4 in of drywall out of here. And i'm going to install the schutter cie board along the back side as well okay. And then when i build this frame we'll wrap that in cie board as well it's nice. And simple  i'm probably going to waterproof the board to the tub surface we'll have to show you that in just a few minutes we're going to want it definitely waterproof with the ctie tape to the tub surface okay if i use the ctie tape to about maybe half an inch on the tub surface. And then up. Then i'll be able to have a waterproof seal to the tub. And avoid water sitting underneath that gap. And i think that's what i'm going to have to do the other solution is i'm going to take the ctie fix  or the sealing bond cuz it's easier to get a hold of okay up here in can we have leage sealing b bond down in the states you guys have a loctite corporation. And they make all the same stuff. So they have a loctite seal. And bond product. And you can actually throw a thick bead okay. And then set the board in the bead problem solved you fill that gap with something that's going to seal it up forever. And it be waterproof. Then that that's a lot easier. And probably a lot more cost effective than buying a roll a c tape. So now i have a plan i got to go shopping i need a little bit more of this board wasn't sure what was going to be found here. But this is just a thin plywood okay. So this particular tub comes with these wooden blocks already an adhesive attached to the tub. And it's it's got a quarter inch gap. So it's great for facade you put a quarter inch plywood on there or something. And you paint it in trim it up like i did  cuz that's not doing anything to help okay this board was installed to be the back or the same depth as this. So i'm going to just save that. And then we'll move on all right well. Now it's time for me to prep for my tile. And in order to do that i want to get rid of this drywall surface because of the fact that this could hold water. And i'm not going to get rid of a lot i'm just going to cut out like about 4 in or something. And i'm going to replace it with the schutter board  or the d shield that i just bought because i went to the store to get enough schutter board. And they were out of stock loving it. So i picked up d shield because in a tub environment i don't need to worry about having a waterproofing system i just need to make sure that i have a good quality tile backer that isn't going to be deteriorated if it gets you know in contact with some water which will be temporary. So dent shield is a perfect solution for that situation it's a fiberglass based board don't recommend it in showers personally. But that's because it requires silicone in order to have good joints or you're using schutter ctie membrane if you're going to go through all that hassle you might as well just buy the cie board right out of the gate because it's the same price as those two products put together. And a hell of a lot easier to work with if you can get your hands on it. So here we are today being creative. And bobbing. And weaving with the co supply chain issue this is my tile you might have seen this before we're using it in the bathroom in the shower. And we're going to just bring it over here cuz it's going to look lovely. Now what i want to do i'm just going to walk through my process from way my brain thinks. So it's a little scary you can see that this is the leftover of that other wall that was here. But i'm putting in a 2x6 wall here. And that only comes to this point 2x6 plus the the d shield plus the tile is going to come down. And cover my floor i'm really hoping. So i just dropped a laser level on the edge of the tub. And i'm going to find out where my 6. And 1/2 comes to here like really just to the edge of my floor boring. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to build my 2x6 box. And i'm going to shim. And then attach the tub to the box with the added part of a shim. And that'll give me an extra eighth to 3/16. And that'll give me positive contact on there okay it's not a real big deal just going to be a little bit creative. And that will be fine. So basically what i'm doing is i'm going to put a leg here a leg there something like a 2x4 across on the bottom just to give it some stability  a 2x6 across here. So that i can attach my tub to the structure. And that leaves nothing. But space. So that when my plumbing comes tomorrow. Then i can put in a proper backer piece. And all that sort of stuff okay. Now the other challenge here of course is the floor has a slope. So i need to use a laser level to draw my line to build my box remember just because just because your floor is not level doesn't mean you want to build everything else not level okay your your counter is level the tub is level i want the box level the tile should be level. And you want it have a finished spot. And then everything. Then grow to make make contact with the floor. So i want to just take a measurement here. And we're going to just remind us that this is 11. And 5/8 let's do some tub math 11. And 5/8 okay. Now right here i'm also going to want to leave room i want to build in the a gap of about a about an eighth of an inch that i can silicone the finish okay. So i got an eighth there i'm going to use a 1/8 grout line there all right. And that is good. So that's grout line grout line tile. And what i want to do is i want to build this two tiles tall. So we'll do that again all right. So that's 22. And 10 11 128 which is 20 3. And 48 or a half that's the he of the finished tile off my deck all right. So what i'm going to do. So i'm just going to mark that right here 23. And a half this is where the science gets really crazy if that's where my tile finishes okay. Then i want my box here to be built. So that the tile that's on top of the box finishes at this height as well all right i know that sounds a little bit wonky. But that's what we're going to do. So i'm going to drop my laser level on this line right here. So i can measure at this point. And measure at this point to that line in space to create the perfect height box. So that when i'm done i can take my wood dimension add my tile backer. And my tile to have this tile line come all the way across little preparation goes a long way in this environment. And you also can cheat a little bit. And take a hair off okay we have the ability to  modify the finished height cuz i'm going to put the back on i'm going to put the top on. And then i'm going to build down the sides right cuz i need this gr line to come across. And then whatever the gap is is what i'm going to use what i'll do is i'll do first tile second tile full tile we're going to cap this surface with the plastic edging. And this surface with the plastic edging. And then push the other tile up to the plastic edging. So that it's consistent boom are you a superhero that one is 40. And 5/8 is our total height. And then over [music] here 41. And 7/16 well at least the bottom will look good like we'll have full tile full tile full tile. And then like you don't know a half tile or something on the bottom that'll be fine you see how this is built out past the tub i'm going to do the same thing with the other box i'm going to build it to the end. And then add another piece to get over top of the hardwood good. Now i can take a measurement cuz the outside wall is going to be sloped too. So 34 34. And a quarter we'll call it all right. So just to summarize because our wall isn't level or plum. And our floor isn't level you have to find an imaginary point out here. And then this becomes your square all right that's why i use a laser line because i can draw a line off the existing. And then i can use that as a mark. And then i can draw another line. And i can create an an imaginary square point out here okay that's what i'm doing you got to think backwards because this has to be plum. And give the illusion that everything is square. And level. So if this point in your imaginary point here is out you're done you can't even start that's why we drew a line here. So that the tile comes across that's why this is set to this height. And then that's why we brought it out with a laser line across the front just to give everything the perfect illusion. And then with that using that point i can measure back in every other direction okay. So if you can just imagine it it's almost like somebody was sitting here going here's your spot there's the outside corner. And then you can have somebody else measure from that corner. And over direction it's the same idea. But because i'm standing here alone i'm using laser level all right hopefully that helps. Now i got my cut list let me go run my lumber. And we'll screw this together some decking screws. And mount the tub. And get everything square. And level yay woohoo. So off camera i just  made an adjustment because the outside wall is tilted out when i screwed it together it screwed it wanting to stick this way. So what i did is i took out the middle piece. And i cut a 2° angle on this from here on this angle here all right. And then i attached that to this board first. And then over on this end i simply just raised it up. And as i raised it the the structure started to shift. So i found a sweet spot it's almost an inch higher on this side. And that's what caused it to lean. So now it's installed it's perfect let's see if this looks decent oo that's close feel like i got my measurement wrong here just eye a hair there's an easy solution to that problem one of the benefits of building with screws is if something's screwed up you can fix it you know i was working with an imaginary corner after all right there that's close enough to fix with the tile. Now we're square like it's important because when you walk in a room you're line of sight you're going to see this line you're going to judge it based on the window trim. And these types of things you know make sure you just take that extra moment. And double check if you got to make a repair make it you're building with screws it means you can take it apart. And do it again this isn't that key of furniture if you take a screw out the wall panel doesn't disintegrate it's just lumber right. So let's just make sure we do that right  the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to attach my tub to this cross section here. So i'm going to add a/4 inch to my distance always pre-drill this hole this is fiberglass it's not going to stretch for you. And not going to secure anything long term unless you put a screw through a hole [music] [music]. Then once i've got this in i'll be able to move the base until it's leveled this direction or plum sorry god why is it as a canadian i'm always saying level instead of plum or is it just me because i'm from cambridge nice. Now we got a situation where everything is attached i've got structure to the tub again i got my hot. And cold lots of flexibility here to hook up the tub. And i got a nice deep cavity. So that when i have my tub spout sitting here the shower there's like a w shower extension that actually mounts inside the housing. And the  the hoses inside the interior of the wall. So that's why i just kind of went with a simple box. And i left lots of room for that hose to dangle don't want to getting caught inside there later i'm feeling good okay. And like most of the times when i'm working out of the top of my head i make changes as i go which is good because it's good to know how to make changes  here's my rough in fitting for my faucet for the tub it  it weighs about 6 or 7 lbs solid brass. So if you want to know where to buy quality like this. And not plastic. Then we'll put the information in the video description okay what i'm going to do is my back is going to be two tiles tall we already established that. But i'm not a big fan of how tall this is relative to the counter. And i don't need the extra privacy. And i don't need the extra space either cuz this is going to be easy to connect the fittings are going to go here my lines will connect. And i can mount this as low as or high as i want. So i'm actually going to make this section one tile high cuz i don't want to make the room feel claustrophobic. So here's my tile here's my line that's my cutting point. Now the only thing you need to know. Now is that if that's where my finish is that needs to be the finish after my d shield right. So i got to take a half an inch off okay. And make it a healthy half an inch for pete's sake you can always pack on a little bit extra mud because when i'm tiling this i'll tile all the walls first. And then i'll put the c tap on last with the edging all right that makes it. So much easier to do. Then that way i've got the ability to add the extra cement if i need it in order to create that buildup. But the tile will finish at this line cut here add the dent shield tile on top i'm ready to go. So now. Now it's time to set the blade there we go. Now i'm going to resize it. And get moving forward all right guys when you're going to install the plumbing fixtures you always get paperwork. Now the information that you really want to know here is a the center of this fixture matches up with the center of the tub that's what that c is down here okay. And then this is the tub surface. And they recommend 7 in from the deck all right that's easy enough to do. And then here's your depth setting you see here there's a a finished wall that means after you're done the tile. So this measurement here here this thickness is lumber plus st shield plus tile all right don't get confused with that. And the maximum depth from the finish to the back is three. And is  3. And 7/8 or 3 in. And the minimum is 2. And a qu. So what i'm going to do is take those two numbers. Now so my minimum is 1. And a4 for my back plate because i get another inch of den shield. And tile okay. So i'm going to measured off inch. And a quarter that's my minimum that's as close as i can be forward which makes this stick out as far as it'll allow me. And i don't like that because i have zero mercy. Now so i'm going to move it back a little bit more okay. And i was up to three. So i can go to 2 in. Now look it this here this zone this is the safety zone for the install if it's back too far. Then the handle assembly is going to not go on properly it's might run into rubbing. And grinding issues. So when i'm installing what i want to do is i want to measure my bracing right in the middle that's my safety zone okay. So i'm going to put in a horizontal piece. Now it's at that point here it's just a little bit behind this plate. Now the trouble with my situation more than i'm dealing with is i don't have the plumbing cut yet well that's fine i'll just leave it out of the way i'll cut that later let's get that horizontal piece in first. And on the other side is. And the good thing here is it's just about a/ quar inch behind this right. So i know it's right about there is where i want to go. And my 2x6 go something like this okay perfect. Now that's just. So that that end doesn't fall down while i'm screwing this [music] in i'm just going to use this cocking line as my line. And replace drywall with d shield cuz it's just a tub i just want to make sure that this area here if there's any water setting it's not soaking it up into the wall from behind. So being a little paranoid. But this is a great time to be a little [music] paranoid. Now you remember in another video i was talking about i was going to review these black blades i don't know i mean they work great i just don't know if they're worth paying extra money they seem to do the same thing the other ones do as far as i'm concerned there it is easiest way to describe this it's made by a drywall company. But it's made out of fiberglass okay. So if you think fiberglass pink or fiberglass yellow from 40 50 years ago was hard to work with this is nasty all right do not use any kind of power tool to cut with this okay that that'll get in your lungs. So fast. And you'll have to go to the hospital they drive you crazy. But if you're careful handling it. And you cut it. And you install it. And then you just go. And wash your hands. And arms under cold water you're going to be fine. So just a warning there i hate to see somebody do something stupid. And get sick i'm going to do from corner to the middle. And then from middle to the other side here just. So that we have something to screw it to okay you can scratch the front. And then break it just like commercial drywall what makes it commercial the 5/8 stuff. And fire rated is it's got the glass fiber in it well this is the same kind of thing only it's just it's like glass fiber on steroids right i mean it's just crazy there we go as little dust as possible that's it you don't even have to cut the backside right i'm going to make sure i got a factory edge down. And i'm going to set it in my adhesive when i install this we've got to have a tile backer cuz we don't want to have our any of our a tile actually attached to wood right expansion contraction you got to have something that you can tile on this is a guaranteed tile backer system it resists absorbing moisture if you leave it outside for weeks in the rain it's still relatively dry you know take it inside for an hour or two. And it's good to go it is guaranteed as a tile backer for life residential installation. And if you have ever seen that yellow panel on the outside of commercial buildings this is what they're using this is their weatherproofing system for us up here okay they just stick all this stuff cover the whole outside of the house there's no building material on the outdoor on outside of commercial anymore that absorb the moisture. So you got this outside of rockwall it's a great little system right nothing soaking up the water. And then you've got steel stud. So generally speaking any water that gets past the facade really has nothing to cling to it just drains to the bottom. And runs out all right. Now i need my cocking gun here we go sealing bond okay  this is in canada down in the states it'll say loc tap all right pretty sure they're the same company. But some of these products have to have different names in different countries not exactly sure what the rules of rags are for all that. But okay. Now we're going to just set a nice thick bead here all right there's no better seal than just not having a gap available right walk right up to it. Now we are going to absolutely fill this spas here with cealing bind which is going to absolutely waterproof this joint okay. So that no water that comes on the tub edge it's going to have anywhere to pull. So then after we put our tile in we can finish with silicone. And we're going to be just fine just going to tul it in with another piece of leftover acrylic tubs you can't really get a good bond with silicone right. And in this situation because my tub goes down if i don't feel that space water's going to sit there. And whatever silicone i have on the surface is going to be rendered useless i miss that all together you can't you can't have water sitting in the silicone it lifts it up. And it goes right behind anyway like as if it was never there this stuff is nasty to work with. But it works right like that that really does work i know you're going to be looking at that going wow that is the weirdest thing i've ever seen. And you're probably right. But the point is is i can't have the water sitting there cuz no matter what i use if the water gets in behind. And sits there it's going to fail this will at least give whatever silicone i have a fighting chance because it's going to keep the water out all right well let's get the rest of this tub covered. And we can get it tiled  of course we're going to show the plumbing installation in just a minute. And then i'll show you the finishing touches cuz i have to have a trap door at the end here as well because it's a a jetted tub. So you have to have access to the motor. So the last panel that goes on over here we're going to show you how to get that mounted. So that you can have that removable. And then other than that you know we'll put on the finishing trims. And we get this sucker all cleaned up we'll be good to go this product i chose rebel pro. And if you're not sure where to find this product i'll put a link in the video description. But it has a tub spout. And it has a removable shower wand. So you can rinse down your tub. And then it has a a handle that's a thermostatic valve. So you can adjust. And pret your temperatures okay all you got to do is turn it on. And you'll always get the same heat in the tub as you're used to. So it's really simple you don't have to guess. And add water. And add cold add hot you just set it the where you want it set it. And forget it right it's really sleek this is the the plate okay that goes on the wall i mean doesn't get any better than that right that's going to be just. So sexy okay let's get this going got all the functionality here i got this. And here's the riel pro thermostatic valve system this is where you go to open this up or close it okay nice. And simple what we want to do today is we want to get this mounted right here with this on the center line okay. And then in order to do that i've got to make some room for my water lines right here. And i'm just going to use my sawall instead of setting this up i bent my water lines out of the way. So i'm not going to run into issues. And i'm going to just be aggressive. And get it done battery's already dead probably not a big surprise i got one on the charger i'll be right back it's a funny thing about older tools or sorry older batteries because this is a brand new tool it was an older battery it just doesn't have the same oomph anymore. So if you find your tools just underwhelming you don't throw out the tool go get new batteries you'd be surprised how much more life you can put into your tool i'm going to move that it's going to vibrate off. And [music] kill yeah that's close enough okay all right i just wish these came packs ready. But you know there's only. So much demand for this kind of product they make it copper ready or whatever disappointing okay. Now let's focus on this this is a half in npt thread. And that's half in pecs ready since the beginning of  water supply in the history of north america we've been using half2 in. And pt thread first on steel. And galvanized pipes. And now it's in brass. And copper brand new fittings are still using the same thread size is plumbing that's in your house that's 140 years old. So feel free to never have to be wondering what that fitting is going to be it's always the same darn thing all you need to know is if it's a male thread like this fitting or the female thread. And you can do as much piping like this as you want to. But you're going to want to use the teflon tape. And you hold it with your thumb. And you stretch it around the threads okay. And there's a lot of thought. And conjecture on this. But bottom line is you put it on the same direction counter sorry you put it on contrary to the direction you thread it in. So it stays wrapped tight otherwise here i don't know if this is going to happen. But it'll all come loose you see when you're putting it in. And then you don't have waterproof here we go. Now nice. And tight okay cuz once this is in the wall you don't get a chance to go. And torque it again to fix it without taking your tile off. So it's important when you're done this have your sh shut off valve horizontal. So it's closed all right turn the water back on pressure test it let it sit 4 6 hours overnight is even better because if it develops just a drip of water depending where you are like i'm on a really high quality water softener system i don't have any  contaminants zero parts per million of my water. So it won't self-seal you know with all the little crud that's in the line if you're on city water. And you don't have a filter even a small drip will end up sealing itself. Now there's no rule as to how tight to put this on. But i will tell you this if you got anything left in your use it okay that's the only guarantee you got that it won't leak remember most of these threads. And fittings  have at least one component coming from an international supplier that may not have the highest quality standard of manufacturing. So you don't really know what you're buying right i know that my my fitting here is actually manufactured in quebec. So i don't have a problem that's canada folks we get great plumbing fixtures out of quebec if it's twisted up on you fix it you don't want to have a big knot on your threads here we go. And i like three runs maybe four  cu it's not just a sealant it's a lubricator. And a sealant okay it fills in all the gaps. So the water can't escape. But it also lubricates brass on brass. So that you can tighten it up more. So that's fingertight okay. And that's with the wrench. And one of the ways you can tell if if it's good is if they both have the same depth another quarter let's see yeah okay let's work. Now that might just be me being paranoid. But i'd rather be paranoid than have a leak okay if you're not sure if you're strong enough to make that work get a a longer wrench okay or even get this. And put it in a vice grip on a table or something the longer the wrench the more torque you have okay. So if you're small. And tiny. And you're doing your own plumbing just buy a wrench  like a crescent wrench with an adjustable end. So it can't slip off. And get it with like a like a foot. And a half long you can even take a big piece of pipe this isn't the greatest example. But you can put that over the end. And then you can really torque it from here oldfashioned science right the further away you are from the point the more power you have. So that can make up for the difference there's a center line for you okay it's close enough ah sometimes you don't need a laser level. Now this right here cuz i read the instructions this goes on the center line that makes life really simple doesn't it okay. And in order to have lots of flexibility the pipe i'm going to go just a little bit higher here. And confirm with my wall plate that that's going to work okay remember end from the beginning. Now even to go all the way up to the top of this wood i still have enough room for this plate it's going to look a little silly. So i'll bring it down a couple inches all right. So let's try this out yeah i'm really comfortable there i think we're going to be fine okay. So i want my water line to go to there. And that tells me where to cut the pipes okay let's do this turned off the water i've drained the taps there should be nothing. But air in here if i'm wrong max is going to drop the camera. And go running downstairs just joking max you don't have to drop the camera hear the air rushing. Now the line's really draining if i was wrong i'd be having water all over the place. Now you can see i can push down a little bit to about here or i can lift it up to about here that's my mercy okay it's good to know what your mercy is when you're doing plumbing it's best to go with pushing it down from it contact. And then if you have a problem or your crimping doesn't work or there's a leak or something you can. Then just yank it up. And cut to the new line. And reinstall okay don't have to run a brand new line. And i'm going to put pressure while i turn. So that it cuts through clean without collapsing the pipe because if all i do see how round that is right here's the other side if all i do is crush it ends up going oval on me okay that's a lousy example here let me just see how oval it can get all right before you cut it. So depending on the condition of your cutter you don't want that you can't operate with the o-rings with that. So twist while you're cutting. So then when you go to put put the o-ring on okay look how easy that is here the oval side got to reform the pipe it'll drive you crazy okay. So twist. And cut makes the installation easy here we go slide it right on there. Now give it a bit of a pinch. So it doesn't slide down on you okay same thing i'm going to go like this find my mercy woohoo well that was rude are you done okay always exceptions to every rule isn't there it wants to slip just give it a bit of a squeeze. So then it won't slip okay. Now put the hot in. And the way you know this is in north america generally speaking hot's on the left if you are from quebec hot is usually on the right fascinating is it not sure why. But that's okay just got to know the rules of the of engagement for where you live. And okay. Now that that's done we're going to go turn the water back on i have no idea if this is off isn't that fun. So what i'm going to do i'm going to put a set screw into this mount. So when i turn the water on if it needs to be adjusted at least it's  going in the right space right in the tub okay. So the water can only come out here or here at least at least that way we're protected in case eh might seem ridiculous. But that's not a test cap that's the actual val. And if it wasn't installed in the closed position from the factory you know i have a ton of water firing out right. Now so good oh yeah okay nice let's get this in a place where we're all comfortable i think that's going to be good. Now the way that we're going to find out if this is installed level is i'm going to put the plate on again okay because this is level when we're done if i can't get that in the right spot there's no sense installing it right beauty okay what a great time to add backups to the system. Now this is great because they've got top m top. And bottom mount screws if your wood is twisted you can leave a little bit of pressure on on the bottom let's say. And then tighten the top. And you cuz you really want this perpendicular off the wall we don't know yet do we the only way to check that out just go back into the box here we are this will be the one that tells the truth knowing the end from the beginning folks it's what light is all about great time to check out how this system works too okay all right 2 in two. And a 16th doesn't sound like much. But i'm telling you right. Now in my experience that 16th is all the difference in the world because when you tile you're going to have a gap at the top. And not in the bottom. So there we go all right perfect every time all right. So we're roughed in we know we're not leaking the only thing left to do. Now is take all of these fancy little doodads put them over top of your fixture there we go that's obviously for here this one's for here. And what these do is they give you exact dimensions of where your holes go when you're doing your tile work. And your wallboard okay. So you don't necessarily need it here for the wallboard. But it helps right you have something to mark too you can even get these lines top. And bottom look at that these are 12 3 6. And 9. So that you can identify. And measure to these grooves get your holes perfectly situated awesome. Now before i go further i still needed to put the 4in screws on the back of this to mount it to the floor we're going to take care of that i'm going to close the back of this wall up we have a treat in the shower we use a a relatively inexpensive cement there's like 15 or 20 bucks a bag over here we're going to use a $45 sm because in this situation i'm going to put the back two tiles on. And then the rest of this tub i'm going to tile from the top part. And then go down. And i'm using a cement that will hold the tiles in place. So that i can build in the opposite direction that way because i have a slope on the floor i can have perfectly horizontal level lines all around the top. And then build down. And measure to the floor from each point. And cut everything perfect this is good to know for an extra 25 bucks a bag you can get an ultra light white cement. And i bought it at lowe's. But it's not called ultra light it's just called lightweight mortar they changed the package okay. So we'll show you that we'll get through all that process  i'm just going to go put the back on. Now and show you how this is all done wrap it up. And then i'm going to show you how to drop a center line. So that you can balance this out okay there's no sense doing it yourself if you're going to do yourself in is right it's diy not dyi if you can't make it look professional when you're finished you shouldn't even start because you're going to devalue the project. And devalue your home right all these little steps making sure everything's square. And level. And working from the center out. And working from the top down these are the things that separate professional jobs from homeowners who are just experimenting on their home. And you don't want to be one of those okay you want to do a really nice job. So that when you go to sell people go wow the finishes in here are awesome okay first thing you're going to notice here guys is this hot. And cold they're making contact if you're filling a tub that's a lot of hot water mixed with a little bit of cold water it's right over the hole. So if it drips it's going to drip on the ceiling. So let's  keep them from making contact that's a great place to use a scrap piece of lumber problem solved all right. Now i have got some leftover structural screws from my deck which are 4 in long. And they are going to be perfect i couldn't install the other day because i lost the bit that goes with them. So now that i have that i'm going to drop this in there we go we're going to use den shield on wrapping the whole thing. And for the purpose of speeding up. So we can get this filming done today before max in holidays i'm just going to put the back on show you how to drop your center line show you how to work from the top down. And then we'll be able to kick him out of here. And let him get on with this vacation okay he needs a break first of all the height of this thing is a little bit more than 16 inch on center ooh 28 ooh. So evil in a perfect world we could put an extra piece of wood on here. But i don't really care because i'm using a fiberglass wallboard panel that's incredibly rigid. And then once i have cement on this. And then porcelain tile on this the fact that there's no wood in the middle isn't going to mean nothing all right you'd have to drive a car into this to make a dent. So we're not going to get too worked up over the minor details here okay remember i'm not in a shower here this is considered a dry area. So we don't have those annoying rules that wet areas have to worry about we can be a little bit more free. And creative okay. Now i could take the time to scribe the board. But remember what i said about this it's fiberglass board it's not nice to work with. And so in order to make my life a little more simplistic i'm going to split the gap. And just install the darn thing. And if that bothers you it's okay there's different personality types in this world some people get worked up over the little things. So if it bothers you. Then don't do that take the time scribe it wear a mask i am more of a get things done kind of fella. So if it slows me down. And there's a way to get around it. Then i will speed things up every time remember i'm covering this with one tile. And then one tile right i is there's not a lot of grout. And deflection happening there after that cement is geared in 30 days. Now i'm just going to come by. And trim it all off right try to cut straight every time you never know when an off cut be something you can use somewhere else try to cut measure you could try to measure. And cut this ahead of time instead just cut it like it's drywall in drywall we always just install it. And then we trim it back all right. And the only thing we have to worry about here. Now is making sure that it's not higher than the surface. So the next piece of board goes on okay. And you can use a rasp or you can just use your knife on the side all right here we go guys. So i got this all wrapped. Now remember our premise here from the very beginning was to have two tiles high i got a couple of c offs here to show you that plus gr line okay which takes me to this height. Now my back wall will be two tiles all right. And then this wall i want it to come right to here mak sense see that. And then when i lay it one on here that's fine. But i have to start at the top get the top row in the back wall is key. And then everything i build off both ends if i'm always working from this gr line. And working down that all wraps around. And all the lines will line up all the way across cuz we're also tiling the skirt on the front of the tub. So i have no mercy i can't be different here than i at the other end. So this is where laser levels. And end from the beginning. And really planning out. And having a proper process makes a big difference i'm going to have to even level this here. And then scribe the tile on the other end till i get that perfect angle. And then i can mark the cut for this end there's going to be a lot of work involved with this. But if you want something. And sexy it's going to take time. And energy you can't just get sexy. And cheap. And easy right i mean there we go. Now the other thing i want to do is i want to get this front tile done because the back wall is on a bit of a slope out okay i want to be able to have that cut stone. And angle up against the back. And then cap it with something that's square i'll get a much better gr line there than if i put this on first. And then try to scribe the line up to it anyway. Now i know that the back wall is going to be perfect i can actually start building this side wall based on this g line right here one thing i should mention before you're doing a tile job the larger the stone  especially with porcelain the more prone to chipping. And cracking the are in the corners okay handling this material is very difficult a lot of warehouses screw up on a regular basis when you get your boxes open up the ends double check okay set aside stuff that's damaged like this cuz it's really easy to use that in a place like this right nothing wrong with that ha okay. So one of the benefits of having an alex in your neighborhood is always cut in the grass when you're trying to make a video okay. Now this might seem crazy. But what i'm doing here right. Now is creating temporary support for this tile. So that i can scribe this end i got to get this angle right first. So the just double check it okay make sure that this is good yeah this side needs to come up a little bit this side's nice. And flush have an accident here this is going to blow your mind. But the the head on the screw is a pan head. So i'm going to lift the tile a [music] bit set it on the pan there is my 16th of an inch that i needed bam perfect i've got the ability to scribe this line. And it is as simple is taking my tile setting it beside it flat to the wall. And drawing my line okay. Now i can run that through the wet saw bring it back up here. And then mark where i want it to finish it's a little up. And down the stairs. But like i said if you want it perfect do what you got to do. And make it perfect i had the angle wrong at the very beginning. So i had to make an adjustment no worries that's what grou for all right. Now i'm just going to use my square mark my spot here. Now i like to cut on the black mark because my tile cutter on the wet saww cuts square. And then this is all square. And plum i don't have to draw a whole line just to mark to get started like i mentioned this is a ultra light white okay this is a lot easier to work with than the cheaper cement it's expensive i know. But look how easy it is to put that on it doesn't just drop off. And land all over your feet right sometimes it's just worth it to pay the extra money. Now in this situation i need it specifically for the fact that i'm going to be mounting this tile on this this wall. And i need it to stick okay. So we're going to show you a demonstration of how well this stuff works going to get all the lines going the same direction we don't need to back butter because it's a dry space it's not a wet area here. But if you want to take full advantage of the suction capacity. And the holding power of the cement back butter your tile okay it helps to create the vacuum just fill in all these grooves okay here we go the way you do this is you want to set it quarter to half an inch higher than you want it all right. And then collapse the ridges with pressure here we go. Now i'm going to use these screws just to make sure that it's not moving while it sits okay we're going to work on the next one. And in about 5 or 6 minutes this will set up enough that i can pull the screws out it won't move it's a little ridiculous. But that is the case i'm also going to want to set in my leveling clips at this point okay the rating on this tile for carrying 40 lbs is actually for on a ceiling okay it it holds really well on a ceiling on a wall because it's a heavy stone still a little bit of sag you got to give it some setup time. But this is going to work just fine okay. Now have to do the same thing with the next tile to bring it over get it scribed cut it. And then we'll just build down knowing that. Now we've got a level plum perfectly spaced. And everything in this entire bathroom can be built off of that back wall gr line all there is to do. Now is go to the time lapse. And then we'll show you about grouting. And finishing. And sealing this up when you're done. So you're not going to get mold developed later oh. But before the time lapse let's just talk about dropping the center line. And how to set up your marks. So that you're always working from the middle. And then left. And then right from that center line this will make it perfect all right. So what we're going to do instead of measuring the totality of this structure we have two options we can go center of the tub or center of the structure i'm going to let you decide what you want to do in that on here i have a 2x6 wall here i have a 2x8 wall the line is going to be. So close it won't be funny if i'm out an inch. And a half here on the tub it's going to look really out of balance from here to here versus here to here. So i'm going to go with the interior of the tub i always found that's the best way to go about it. And that is 65 in on the inside right cuz this is an extra size. So 652 it's 32. And 1/2 let's get something here that i can make a measure with okay. Now i'm just going to drop a laser line on it there we go this represents my g line. So there you go. Now i've got a line to measure okay. So i can measure from here to this point right in the middle of that tile remember over here i'm going to be putting a plastic edging. So i got to leave room for that plastic edge cuz i'm going to finish at that point. And then the top tile will also sit flush at that point. And it'll be about there. And then there'll be a plastic edging on it as well. So this is how we figure it out right in this middle of this tile is my line okay okay. So now i can take this measurement. And i can install that tile. And then i can take this measurement to the wall. And i can install that tile nice. And simple okay. So we've got our our faucet fixture finishing here. And all laid out  generally you want to go through all the instructions first. And then double check that you've got all the right little tools. And gizmos okay the little allen key for the set screws comes in the package. And so we're just going to go through the assembly system here there is a little ring here that is going to be used as a locking pin for the plate okay. So this is actually going to get connected by three different functions. And all three of them have a different way of putting pressure on the plate to hold it tight to the wall. So it's going to look really amazing when it's done. But here we go let's just step one this is brilliant there's going to be a little hole in the tube that always le at the front just in case any water finds its way in here that's all that's for okay nice. And simple. Now there's also this ring here. And this one threads on go backwards until it sits nice okay that is going to give you a nice look. And it maintains a gap. So you don't have rubbing okay. Now there is part of this locking system for here is this little piece really peculiar okay. And it has it's a set screw that's the functioning side. And it faces down. And it actually gets set into the trim. And then after it gets done you can push on the plate. And set the screw into this okay because this is pulled forward forward against this locking nut okay. So you can create pressure. Now we're going to slide this all into place okay great we'll get to that later first we're going to take this piece stick it back on. And this is the to create the pressure here right okay there we go. Now it's in place. But it's not creating pressure. So i'm going to use my screwdriver to turn this threaded piece into the valve body until i get my pressure that i'm looking for right there's no more movement there we go awesome don't use pliers because these two little washers on the top here they need to be in perfect condition you got to protect them that's why we had the covers on while we were tiling got to protect these washers. So that all of these little nuances actually end up working for you. Now here's our fitting piece you can see there's a washer in here that's good that's what we're going to need because the hose has threaded in. So we have a washer means we don't use tape or or goo okay it keeps it nice. And clean we slide this on all right. And then there is a set screw. And generally it take a few turns when you feel it getting tight that's good when one more turn. Now what i want to do is make sure this is nice. And level okay good that one's done this is the tub filler amazing it actually has two set screws not one that's some that's intense okay again it just slips right on on. And then we're going to tighten up those screws good it's almost too easy is it okay. Now this particular handle the rebell pro line that we're working with this smooth part of the valve body is actually the handle the part that turns to turn the water water on or off oh boy i did it didn't i yep i forgot to turn the water on whoops. So i forgot  i have to open up the hot. And cold water lines as as part of the valve body first i'm doing this out of order i almost forgot i've done this before right in here both of those set screws have to be pointed vertical instead of horizontal you don't have any water coming up new modern valves have got got accessibility like that built into the design. So be really careful about that okay. And we're back. So now i'm caught up to where i should be. Now we can put the handle on as i was saying you've got two set screws here. So make life easier put it in position. And then slide it on okay. And then you turn the bottom until you make contact not too tight okay. And then you can go sideways like this. And get some good torque ability okay really want to dent that set screw into the brass okay. Now we got control good okay. Now this is for our thermostatic valve okay this one here just slides right on. And again it has a set screw this sets your temperature what you want to do is in this scenario you can take this alleny. And you can release the set screw okay. And you can change your temperature all the way hot. And all the way cold look at the look at the variation there right. So if you like a really hot tub you can just kind of dial it back a little bit. And then reset it. So it always is up. And down at the temperature you like okay. So you don't have this you know sitting weird looking. So we're going to just dial that back just like that a little bit. And we're just going to set the screw in here for. Now and. Then when we're all done we'll get the water running. And then we'll check to see where we'd like to have it sitting. Now let's de with the hose hopefully watching this video you guys all realize that plumbing is not all that tricky you should feel empowered to be able to do this on your own this is the end that goes in here remember there's a washer in that we'll just thread that in. Now i'm going to do a water test to see if doing this fingertight makes enough compression with that gasket or if i have to get a wrench i'm set it on there i'm pretty sure that that's going to be enough the washer that came with the kit goes in here. And we're going to simply connect up here. Now now the the secret here is to adjust this hose okay. So that it's comfortable hold it with your fingers hold the top with your other fingers. And now tighten. So you're not twisting the hose into a kink okay i'm going to have to run this a couple of times until you get it where you want it yeah that's pretty nice i like that okay. Now before we put all of our caps on okay i've got two here one for the top. And bottom here we're going to get out of the way a little bit we're going to test this out okay here goes everything okay okay well here we go we have got a problem houston you know might be something really simple. But it might be something not. So simple we'll find out okay. So let's just make sure we got water coming through yep that one's working mhm. So that goes to the middle that's off. And then that goes to that tub. So that's all the water i got it's just a dribble that's supposed to be the hot side i guess. So that's about the highest flow rate that i'm going to get to fill a [music] tub. So my problem here is i didn't i didn't have my cold line open all the way. And this thermostatic valve works different than the showers i've worked with the the functionality here is the handle turn this way turns on the middle which is the wand the handle turn this way turns on the tub faucet okay. And this is your temperature setting all the way to the left was cold water. And it's only designed to mix a little bit of cold water in. So with the valve being half open. And all cold there was no water coming through. So once i open the valve properly. And then i adjusted this to the hot okay. So now it's under full pressure it's working great. So now i've got where i want. Now i can close this up it kind of makes sense you know to make sure that your water. And temperature. And everything is perfect before you move forward kind of put cart before the horse there all right yeah there we go that's working that's really nice. And then beautiful. Now the only thing left to do here is get my almond silicone out dry up my areas. And do all my joints okay. Now i'm using the almond all right it's a silicone product we're going to do it anywhere i have tile intersecting tile or tile intersecting the tub. And it just going to work this easy. Now i'm just going to put a small bead everywhere smooth. And wipe as i go this is going to be beautiful actually before i go any further i got to install the trap door all right the beautiful thing about velcro guys this is basically what i'm doing. And just going to kind of guesstimate as long as i'm anywhere close when i put these on we're going to have great contact right of course the way that you take that out when it's time is to grab one of those cute little yellow suction cups that they sell at the home depot you just stick it on close the handle pop it out when you need to that one's done out of sight out of mind all right. Now that the trap door is done let's just get back to finishing all the silicone work guys if you like the these kind of videos give us a video a thumbs up.

And we're doing about a six or seven part video series on remodeling a bathroom. So make sure you subscribe to the channel hit the like button if you like learning how to do this kind of stuff yourself. So you can take make a ton of money. Now what i just marked here is my 4t line okay cuz i'm going to be cutting out 4t of dry wall. And the reason i'm cutting out 4t of drywall well that's the size of drywall at the store. So i'm going to make my life simple by cutting the hole the same size as the sheet that i need to buy to cover up the hole when i'm done makes sense. So that's going to be my hole. And i'm going to make it almost the entire 6 ft okay. And i'll tell you why because right. Now i've got my plumbing stack here. And the vent goes up when i change the plumbing. And i have two drains i also need those vents to go up. And then travel across. And reconnect with this venting higher than this sink if it was full of water to guarantee them i'm always going to have fresh air coming to that drain if i connect too low i can eventually fill up the fresh air venting system with water. And then i'm in a whole heap trouble. So this is why i'm going all the way up to 4t it makes no difference if you patch a big hole or a small hole it's the same amount of work all right. So just give yourself lots of room to work. And you'll save yourself time in the end. Now i'm going to show you two different techniques for cutting if you have a drywall cutout tool it's a lot faster. But most people don't buy tools specific like that for their diy home projects this is a saw this is like 12 bucks okay. And you can cut dry w with it the secret here is you can also cut your electrical. And your plumbing supply with it. So you want to be really careful you're only cutting with about inch. And a quart inch. And a half all right one of the tips you can do is you can take a black marker. And just mark the blade. So when i'm cutting. And when that black disappears i know i'm going too deep. And then you'll get a fuel for it plumbing electrical code requires it everything is recessed in the wall an inch. And a half okay. So you're not going to accidentally cut things this way or if you don't want to waste all day long with the saw you can buy yourself an ofa knife follow our link in the amazon in the video description. And you can just set this to an inch. And a quarter. Now most drywall is only half an inch thick. And you can just pull line through it usually by the second pass you've gone completely through. And don't worry if it takes you three or four it's just experience [music] talking all right this isn't about being perfect this is about getting most of it the first time you notice that when you get near the end when you start pulling the drywall apart there's always going to be areas that you don't get cut right because there's screws to the wall just bumped into wall stud there. And it's not going to slow you [music] down. And the other side. Now i catch my breath a bit round your electrical take a pair of pliers or a hammer disengage the drywall around the box. So that everything comes clean all right. And then get the first corner out of the way this is not something where we're trying to save this material okay that'll drive you nut just want to reach in here shake it. So all the drywall screws pop through the paper paper. And then they just rip out the other side okay be gentle around your plumbing there we are. So now that i've got the wall open it's time for me to make my material list a i'm going to change these fittings on the pecks these are old crimp rings i'm we're going to go to the solid ring it's a lot better plumbing. And i'm going to need teas. So i can run the hot water in two different directions tease for the cold water run that in two directions i don't have a lot of room to do that. So for whatever reason this is a 2-in pipe i'm going to cut this out big section of it i'm going to change it to inch. And a half that'll give me room to run my my plumbing line through the wall to the other side i'm going to put a t up here okay. And we'll find the location later i'll bring it down. And then to the drain same thing okay over to here. And so we'll end up cutting this out. And putting in a a te that goes in two different directions bring it out to this way. And then bring venting up. And off. And reconnecting venting up top piece of cake really the secret isn't having enough space to know exactly what's going on. So that you can make one trip to the store buy all your supplies. And not be surprised as the job progresses this will be a piece of cake. Now that i got my measurements i know exactly what i'm going to be doing here let's just go over the changes to my plan originally my plan was to take the drain. And vent system here. And tea off in both directions. And install the vanity basically where the hole is cut out. Now now that we've worked on the tub. And got that other thing out the water out of the way the room feels. So much bigger it just seems wrong to not center this on the wall. So instead of using this okay. And converting one here here. So that we can bring our drain left. And right. And one up here to reconnect the venting i'm going to maintain this system right. Now and i'm going to just cut it here. And bring another drain over to this location all right. And i'm going to be making this the center of my my wall. And the center of my vanity okay. So that means i've got to bring hot. And cold to within 3 in of the drain on each side to fit the back of the vanity. And i've got to run all everything over tee it all off to do it again over there. So i got to open up a little drywall i'm going to unscrew these boxes get them up out of the way because i'm going to do this really simple i'm not going to drill a bunch of holes for the wood simply going to take out my skill saw. And cut my lumber. And notch it out. And put on some great big steel plates afterwards to protect the wall cuz this is not structural this is the benefit of of interior walls you can cut them back to almost nothing. And then just slide your plumbing in it's an easy diy system i think you're going to like what i'm going to do all right. So first thing let's dis engage the electrical there we go. And then we'll mount these up. And out of the way. And that looks like there yeah there's wood there there we go. Now now this is out of the way right it's perfectly safe everything's still screwed together. But i don't have to worry about anything because remember when you're renovating you start with the things that are the least flexible like duct work. Then you move on to your your drain. And your venting. Then you do your electrical okay. So if any of that's in your way get it out of your way same thing with the water lines i'm going to do the drain. And the venting first. And then the water supply always make sure that you've got the ability to be flexible right you don't want to be committed to doing something stupid all right. So before i go. And cut the water line. And i have no recourse. But to hold my thumb on it. And scream for help i'm going to just try this slow. And see if there's any water pressure left this line pretty sure i turned it off. And opened up the faucets i got busy talking to max let's find out of course that's just be silly wouldn't it here we go we're going to cut back here because we don't want to have nothing to do with this old style of plumbing we're upgrading okay. Now these are shark bites. So i'll be able to save them for later we're not using them again after the fact we're going to put  pex caps on everything. So we'll just reuse these later some other day for an emergency. Now here we go this is perfect i love this height this one comes through the stud it's going to be really awkward for me to try to make any changes. So i'll have to tea off from here. And that will be all right according to my measurements from my center line which is. Now here. And 202 is a perfect location for my drain i'm really really close here. So we're going to just call that perfect cuz that i can do that okay. And then 20. And a2 from here. So i got to get to just the other side of that brown mark all right. So if i go to 2 feet let's see yes one sheet of dryw will fill this hole perfect okay. So let's just get on with [music] it. And the way i draw that line is i'm actually lifting with my knees. And holding my arm straight. And just standing straight up usually works pretty darn good okay okay 20. And a half oh that's to the center i didn't go over far enough all right we're going to go add another few inches i'm going to cut this pipe at about 3/4 of an inch. So i can set this over top okay that's a female end. And i need to cut my pipe here. And here all right. And then because it's a drain i've got to go that's level. And i'm going to go little bit off level 1° it's almost 2 in wide cuz the inch. And a half refers the interior dimension okay that's the diameter of the inside of the pipe inch. And a half exterior is almost 2 in. So i can make my life simple. And just put this on that existing line. And make a mark here we go. And then when i cut i'm going to cut on the inside of each of these lines okay that way my pipe will fit in that groove. And the plate that i buy will be big enough to go over top of the hole. Now we also have venting we're going to tie in for venting up here somewhere yeah let's do this nice. And tall. And mark that pipe here same thing only different only this one we're going to have a downward slope. And the reason for that is when you put this pipe on. And you've got this curl there is rain water. And that sort of thing that can work its way into the pipe okay. So if i have an a slope this way it'll actually get trapped in here. And i don't want water sitting in here. So we're going to slope it this way cuz it can come down. And then it can follow this drain. And then go down there again that made any sense i hope it did. So we're going to go level. And then downward slow okay there we go that was the math not too tricky at all once you see it coming together right okay. So the secret to cutting a pipe is a small reci ator i would prefer to have a smaller blade even okay what you want to do is you want to hold steady. And then you want to through like crazy. But this close to the stud i've got all kinds of issues i don't want to cut backwards upside down i don't want to go in the other wall. So what am i going to do i'm going to go get my multi-tool i know every six months i pull it out for just a minute. And a half okay. So now i got my multitool. And because i'm a genius my power is still engaged whoops genius can't fit in a plug. Now you know i should show you cuz honestly these are a couple hundred bucks right. And if you're doing a diy project at home. And you're not you don't have tools like this there's another option i'll show you one you go to the hardware store. And you can ask them for a  abs or pvc pipe saw it's a wire saw kind of works like this the wire goes around behind okay. And it's got rings on it it's kind of like from an old movie where someone's sitting in the back seat. But they don't check the back seat when they get in the car. And then the guy leans over. And and he chokes you to death right well the wire saw works like this. And you just hold those rings. And go back. And forth you can slice through a pipe in any situation for six bucks all right. So there's a great diy solution there i used to have one god only knows what happened to it most of my tools end up in the garbage because well my kids work with me. And now we can go some [music] fun yeah that pipe's got a little bit of flexibility out there nice i got a trick for you there's  a lot of play here. And i don't know why. So what i'm going to do do an old trick that a plumber told me one time when he was doing a  ganize replacement pipe situation okay. So what he did is he took this the all round strapping that you can buy at the plumbing store okay. And he went like this. And he wrapped the pipe. And he threw a screw into a stud. And what it does is when you cut the next piece of pipe it holds it where it is. So it's not moving around because you don't want to do your plumbing cut your pipe. And have whatever sitting up top let's say it's a it's teed up. And it goes across the room right it's not supported properly. And then it comes down. And then you go. And do your measurement. Now you've got potentially you've screwed up the slope. And what's going on in the attic you don't want to do that. So strap your pipe connect it to the wall. And then you can [music] go it's like giving a kid a hair cut around as near as in there we go. So when you're done this it makes a mess okay. So you're going to want to just take a knife. And cut all of these burs off cuz really a vibration tool like that it doesn't cut as much as it melts. So it's like a bunch of candle wax all around the pipe okay. So cut back all these burrs inside the pipe as well because this is going to be a drain okay. So we don't want to have that rough stuff sitting there it'll catch all the hair up top it's only vent. So it doesn't really matter be careful with this right pay attention of where the knife's going to go if it slips. Now what i'm about to do should not be possible because i can't find 1. And 1/2 in abs anywhere in ontario don't know why stores are out all my suppliers are out can't find it. But through the power of me being a hoarder i still had a couple of lanks sitting in my shed. And you're damn right i kept that shed locked all all year  building materials if you have something rare they're a real commodity. So i've got this. And i've got a couple of six-footers. So i'm going to be okay to just do all this an inch. And a half which is great if you're stuck. And you want to do this project right. Now and you can't find one. And a half you're allowed to use 2in pipe. And fittings okay what you need to do is do this at some point you're going to have to go to inch. And a half in order to do your p traps. And everything else. So you're going to have to scr up a couple inches of this stuff if you open up your wall you might already have 1. And 1/2 in from here going up cut it out switch to two. And use this pipe. So that you can put your stems on for your new p traps okay because you can use a conversion like this from 2 to one. And a half or you can get a 2-in coupler okay. And this is called a bushing. And it's 2in insert. And then one. And half goes inside of that those are your options okay. So you can convert from 1. And a half to two anywhere you need i am using this which is very common in in the building store it's a 2-in drain inch. And a half here. And an inch. And a half here. And the reason for that is is very very common that the drain coming off of a sink is also the vent for other things in the room. So a lot of times this is what we'll see okay boom right like this. And this is actually the vent for the shower or a tub or a toilet or something else in the room. So that's why if it's going to be a drain. And event it needs to be a 2in pipe that's why we have it. So if you have to do everything in 2in pipe. And then just convert. So you can have inch. And a half stems that way you've got the right plumbing you can do that let's call thor. And have them open up the damn plumbing cap if you don't have a cheap pair of $4 wrench you're not getting these open you know i i don't care who you are this this is just tough. Now we're putting in a new floor. So i don't care if i get this all over the place i'm going to try to be careful. But i'm ahead of myself i haven't cut my hole yet slow down jeffrey slow down let's check our battery power no worries let's check our depth remember my pipe is 2 ines i'm not not enough yet let's try that two inches two. And a quarter i like that two. And a qu is good okay. So we're going to cut everything at two. And a quar hopefully this all works yeah let's see how that works okay. Now on my saw i took my my cut line the zero line. And i put a black marker on it all right it helps make make it really easy to identify when you're cutting cuz i got black marker on the wall i got black marker here my life just got really simple i put the black mark on the black [music] mark perfect every time [music]  this is how we release the stud of the burden of that chunk of wood nice. And easy. And now we got a nice place to run our pipes yep yep perfect time for the glue no mask required all right you want to glue the fitting. And the pipe okay this is not really glue we call it glue it's a solvent. And as such you want to actually melt both the fitting. And the pipe. So then when they meet they meld [music] together did i actually get that just a hair off e dang nab it okay we're going to connect this first okay well we have the luxury of being able to move everything up. And down. And this is going to be a 19in piece of pipe what i generally do when i'm dealing with this pipe is i'll measure. And cut to a place where i know i'm going to see the printing 19 in is right right between the 28 you haven't seen any of our plumbing videos before this is just  it's a pipe cutter it's only for inch. And a half abs. And has a little bit of a tooth on here. So you're going to want to set the middle of the the middle of the fixture where your 19 mark is. And that's right between the two. And the eight twist. And pull. And then that's that easy all right the other advantage of this is it doesn't cause burrs it's no melting it actually cuts the pipe. So we got to be a little quick with this again you want to melt the pipe on both ends okay set it time is of the essence. And forget it step one complete we want to come across here to 20 and2 from my center mark that's where i want my drain. So that's going to be long enough that's good okay. So the first thing i want to do is take a marker. And mark the center line on the back of that wall. So 20 1/2 this is 17. So i got to go three. And a2 okay. So this is my center line all right. So now i got a piece that's going to be long enough i got a center line i have to get my fitting. Now what i'm using is a te okay it's okay to use a te in a wall coming off the off the faucet make sure that the water is flowing in the right direction all right. And it's going to go here it's not just going to go there the center of this pipe is going to go on that center line okay let me just go. And check w that's that's basically right off the wood that makes it easy to measure. So i need because i'm going to be here i want to have 3/4 of pipes for inside the fitting 3/4 plus to the inside of this fitting 362 okay 36/2 is between the f. And the six here's my tool here's my line. And when you cut it you're better to cut it just a hair short all right these fittings if it's in that far. And it's it's it's square it's still going to work it's better to work until it's right all the way in to get it all the way in actually requires a fair amount of glue once the adhesive is on there or the solvent. Then it works together much better. Now what i'm going to connect here to save a fitting this is called a street 90 okay because this end is big enough for an inch. And a half pipe to go in. And this end is inch. And a half pipe. And so it's a fitting that goes right in the end okay. So i'm going to put these two together before i get started if it's on the floor. So much easier to get that 90° angle right we're going to put that in first okay the thing is is that it's tendency to want to sit low. So now i'm going to take some of this all around strap i'm going to glue that end i'm going to take some strapping. And tie this up nice. And tight to maintain my drain if you're doing a plumbing job go. And buy a coil of this stuff it's five or six bucks  there's. So many uses it's just crazy right you're going to you're going to just thank me cuz sooner or later you're going to run into a situation like oh i wish i had the all round just get it. Now here's how you cut all around electrical side cutters okay right there that's it done okay. So now we're ready with that i've got a screw here because we're doing that one under pressure we'll do this joint first mm. Now while it's still setting up that's the time to do this okay put the screw through one piece through another piece don't even worry about it cuz what we're going to do is we're going to screw this on an angle okay see that. And that's just going to keep on pulling until we get it set right where we have maximum torque done everything's out of the way okay yers we're good to go okay make sure you got angle straight up if you're not sure stick a piece of pipe in it make sure it's not sticking out like this before the before your solvent sets okay you got a little bit of mercy here you got a few minutes all right. Now we're in the right direction next thing we're going to need 6 in no solvent here just push it in make sure while you're at the store you buy one of these they come in blue as well okay  different plumbers use them for different things for me orange means that it's attached. And blue means that it's not attached. But i have a free one. So i'm going to use it okay it's up to me to remember that that's not glued when i come back later what if i need this to come out just a little bit further for the sink you don't know until you know. So leave it alone test cap it always when you're removing a test cap check to see if the pipe is attached it's just really good habit all right in case you didn't do that joint you'll get everything installed. And and be like oh look at that there's a little bit of water in the bottom of the vandy you'll think it's a water supply or the taps or something it's just a little drip coming out of here because it's just not quite snug enough without the adhesive i keep calling it adhesive. And if you're in the comments going it's solvent man it's solvent that's fine i guess you know you wouldn't be surprised how many times people have yelled at me in the comments because it's plum not level well i'm canadian okay we're a little weird let's just make sure that this is right you know the old expression everybody says a jack of all trades eh well that's not the expression the expression is a jack of all trades is better than the master of one cuz he's more confident on the job site right let stick a piece of pipe here. And mark the center line boom all right draw the line up great that was easy this pipe's going to come across right probably around there there we go okay. So here is my intersection okay. So boom there's the inside corner all right. So this is the mark that i'm going to measure to make sense. So now i'm going to measure from here to here. And that comes out to be 17. And 3/4 always write down to measurement. And then i'm going to go from here boom looks like about 40. Now when i'm doing this i don't have a lot of flexibility here right. So if i put this pipe in. And i glue it there. And then i glue this here see. Now i'm limited i don't really have enough room here to stick them on. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this pipe in. And i'm going to put this pipe in. And then slam it over okay just always think about your installation. And pick the easiest connection to be the last one okay it's not always just come all the way back to here maybe there's not a lot of flexibility just look for the opportunity to say that's the easiest connection yeah there's a best device i can give you you're on your own you got to figure it out because this is venting we can use these  sharp 990s okay cuz it's mostly air if this was a drain pipe cuz we only have drain from here down this is drain. But a sweeping tea is okay you're supposed to go with really big 90s. Now world has changed really big 90. So if you're getting your plumbing inspected make sure you put in big sweeping 90s or 245s or they will give you some serious heck. And make you do it all over again it's kind of funny you know cuz back when plumbing first started there was code there was rules. And then  the rule was inch. And a quarter pipe for a drain galvanized yeah crazy. Then they found out after i don't know you know 30 40 50 years wow this really doesn't work anymore the drain stopped functioning because of all the corrosion. And the fact that the water supply in people's homes was cast iron water supply. So then they changed everything they got new building materials. And they changed the code. And then since. Then they've changed the code. And made. So many modifications bottom line is when it comes to plumbing  the longer it sits in a wall the less it'll work for you there's no escape you're going to run into problems. So if you're still following  1970 or 1980 building code. And you're not getting inspected that's between you. And god. But truth is most of the latest upgrades unless you're getting inspected aren't necessar to even follow you didn't hear that from me here we go 17 3/4. And a double check looks good to me i'm going to go to 18 do i got a piece that's still 18 in there we go folks the last piece of abs pipe left in the city of ottawa i'm taking 18 ines of it's almost painful to watch it's like eating an endangered species for dinner there we go call me if you want them [laughter] okay can the world just go back to work please again we're going to be quick here before everything sets up [music] all right. And snug is a bug. And a rug hurah okay there's our waist. And our venting finished. And tied in we're. Now done with the good stuff okay don't do that at home kids all right here we go. Now remember earlier i mentioned if you need to you can go with 2in pipe everywhere the danger of that is is that 2in pipe is actually 2. And 1/2 in. So you lose a lot of space. So you got to really pick your battles as to where you're going to put your water lines  the challenge with notching in the front is. Now my water lines got to go on the back side. But i can't put metal plates back there. So i really got to be careful not to go too deep. And here we go check this out slow speed middle speed. And high speeded pretty cool huh i showed you that in case you only have   the finances to buy one drill right. Now that's the one to get we did a video where i showed the differences. And the flexibility of the impact driver. So i link that  it was in our subfloor series i think right max video description or check the [music] cards the reason i want to maintain this 3-in rule is because the cabinet has already got a cutout in the back of it. And i don't want to have to add the drilling holes in the cabinet cuz just look looks cheesy right rather have all the holes coming through the drywall nice. And clean come through that little slice that they've got built out. So take the time to always measure off your cabinet don't just assume yeah we'll set it at 18 or 20. And then within a few inches take your time this is important. Now to tea off. And this is why you always open it up on day one make a list of everything you're going to need. And then go shopping. And buy a couple of extra of everything cuz you can always take them back right  when you're doing plumbing feel free buy couplings get a couple couplings of every pipe size you're working with all right if you mess up a measurement. And you don't have enough pipe to finish you can always use a couple couplings to cut a pipe stick it on stretch it out a little bit all right or make an adjustment. And you can add two small pieces together with a coupling to make it work. So these are like these are gold because they're like 69 cents they can save you an hourong trip back. And around to the store. And that'll cost you like 10 bucks in gas. So while you're at the store spend the 69 cents. And have it on hand. Now going to get our solid copper rings. And then our want to te this way here i'm going to feed this through from the backside with the pipe already crimped on. And then i'm going to roll it. And then i'm going to cut it. And then i'm going to attach it. And then i'm going to grab a  a stub out here again we're going to go find my tools about 8 in 8 in just seems to be the perfect depth never you're doing a a stubo guys all right. Now with pecs of course leave your quarter inch while we're at it as well put on our cap okay this is going to be the biggest challenge of the day getting this pipe in that hole there we go down over. And out okay step one i it's nice to have a rule if you're going to put the fitting in. Then crimp it right don't start moving forward until you've dealt with cuz there's really visually it's very difficult to identify a crimped ring or a non- crimped ring until the water's on that's the wrong time to find out. So if you put it on crimp it 8 in stub out here we'll stick that on okay there we have it water supply for our first sink within 3 in of the center line no problem right if you're worried about the location of it  you can always grab a little bit of string. And just tie them closer together okay. And then when we come along with our drywall we'll have it locked in place. So then you can rotozip all three holes slide it over nice. And clean. Now this this is going to be the tricky one all right. So it turns out the best thing for me to do is actually drill new holes. And then just bring it across up. And out. And i'm going to use this special fitting here to bend the pipe if you got to make a turn you want it supported for the pipe will break okay. So let me demonstrate you just bend it across the metal. And it locks in. And this piece here this bridge keeps it from crimping it won't bend in half. And kill your water supply okay they're like 89 cents if you're going to do plumbing get them all right worth their weight. And gold. So in this scenario i'm just going to connect it. And then i'm just going to drill new holes that's the easiest way for me to just move forward anything else is just going to be a thousand fittings. And i'm not in the mood for a thousand fittings fantastic all right. Now just going to let you know i'm finished my running through i'm going to do a water pressure test. Now because you want to make sure you test your line before you close it up there is a special tool it's a gauge you can buy. And you can go around. And set it on every one of these crimps. And make sure that it's been crimped that's how you tell the difference i don't have the tool on me i got it with the package i've never used it like i said i got a rule if i touch it i crimp it right. So i know some guys will do the whole thing. And put it all together. And then they'll come by. And they'll crimp it all. But that's not me  i'm happy just to do water test i'm feeling pretty confident about this. And it's a lot more exhilarating to do a water pressure test if you're not sure if you got it all crimped all right there we go let's just run through this again i got a drain hot. And cold within 3 in okay that drain is higher. But this one is actually a couple inches lower than normal it's 20 in as normal this one is at 21 which is a little above normal. So what i do is this the p trap for this drain i'm going to use this color attachment all right. So this is a 1. And a qu interior for sinks. And this fitting sits right in the bottom of that p trap all right that is a perfect way to get  drain assembled if you're a little bit high if you're a little bit low same thing over here okay. But this one is an exterior pipe dimension. So then you cut the piece of pipe to fit there you go that's all we need to know. So you can buy the male or the female version of that same fitting. And then when you thread it on the pipe it gets nice. And snug. And water tighten pressure test all right here we go okay max are there any drips forming anywhere nope no any hissing nope okay i'm going to go full blast we're good perfect every time. And we're back okay. So for everybody who  wants to see me do a pressure test well it's pressurized what i want to do is i just give max a call on my phone. And he just visually inspects this while i turn on the water we wait about 10 to 15 seconds to pressurize the lines in the house we're good to go. And like i said with this kind of crimp if it's not leaking. Now it never will okay there's no question there's only one kind of pressure full on. So now we don't have any concern because there's no degradation in that seal you can even freeze that. And it'll maintain its seal it's a miracle. So i love this stuff all right guys there we go okay. So now that i got the drywall on just want to mention real quick if you you want to learn tips. And tricks for doing drywall in weird situations. And creative solutions to problems we'll put a link in the video description. And the card over here  it's one of our top videos guys okay millions of people have viewed it. And love it. And there's lots of great information there. So if you haven't seen it check it out will you're just going to move ahead. Now it's time to grab the vanity. And get it in place okay we want to actually set it in position. And then from there we're going to be able to get perfect measurements for where all of our lights. And our mirrors are going to go. And we can sort out all of that information with the stud finder come up with a plan. And then i got to drill some holes fix the wiring over here shouldn't be too big a deal cool okay good. And and set it down this went by a lot easier than i thought nice okay. Now we're going to bunny hop it over about a foot. And a half. Now you see the holes in the plumbing for the walls looks dead center already what's say 71 35. And a2 if anything i'm a 16th off yeah done all right the only thing we're going to have a problem here matt is  there's a really bad slope on the floor mhm. So let's get the level in here we'll see how much of a slope we have overall okay can you lift that end about that much a little bit more keep going until this levels out look at that we're looking an inch. And a quarter we'll set it right on the right on the head okay [applause] [music] i wish life was always this this simple okay all right [laughter] mahala okay can you drop the  foot pedal on that corner i'm just trying to figure out which way is the right way that is the right way okay there we go we're back to level again okay that's one i wanted. Now we got to go get the sink countertop set that in place because if you're like me your visual person. And it's a lot easier for me to map out what to do here with my mirrors. And my lights. And what how i'm going to fix the wiring tomorrow once i've got the countertop in place right besides i have somewhere to put my tools yep. And then. Then we'll worry about rolling it down afterwards okay mhm all right we're going to use the shims to help us set it down. And then manipulate it okay. So up into the more of the middle that's good watch your hand it's in a lousy spot get the shim on the outside corner can you hold the  tilt well here if you move the shim i'll lift it okay. Now this thing should roll pretty good even if we're just off the front okay if you know what i mean. So there is about a/ an inch overhang on each side we can lift a little bit come yeah okay okay. Now you you can see that yeah. Now come right flush to the front yep okay. Now we should be able to just roll it in no put your hand inside the sink. And then fingertips on the outside corner yeah i got it yeah i'm here on the on the right side yeah not on the back okay oh you know what hold on lift it back up i'm going you can hold it like this yeah okay there's a lip inside the sink yeah i'm right. And it's going to squeeze out nice. And easy. Now take the shim in the middle please sh mine take the shim on your in okay. So i am4 to 3/16 y that's perfect. Now it's perfect okay this is a 72in countertop 36 nice what do you think i think we did a good job i think it works i think there's room to stand here. And open the drawers i got three drawers downstairs let's just get them in okay  less things land around on the floor the better okay. So once you bring your vanity up guys the before you put your countertop on make sure you level it all off right. So corner to corner back front going in three different directions where the shoulder level this way there's a lot of different ways you can balance this in. And depending on your floor. And your conditions in your home you might even have to cut the feet like i did all right. So that's fine do what you got to do. But make sure that the the the place that people see the most prominent corner looks the best. And then make all your adjustments everywhere else if you need to leveling feet cutting the legs whatever you got to do. But you want this to be level. And you want it to be flushed to the wall you don't want to have a gap opening up okay. And then we're in a great position. Now i can get my laser line out. And i can draw a laser line off my sink faucets. And draw my center lines for my mirrors. And then i have a line that i can measure from to open up the wall. And move my electrical around going to be a piece of cake all right guys. So what i'm doing is i'm drawing a laser line here i want to have it going through the center of the hole. And through the center of the drain because this is 8 in off the wall if it's center on these two points it's going up this wall center i'm not going to have any issues right. So i'm just going to go like this. And like this turn this off before i go want for the purpose of helping you all out i'm going to be left-handed for two seconds okay we're going to put a big c on that that's your mark. So you can measure off this line left to right in every direction draw laser lines anywhere you need this is going to be the center of the mirror right. And while we're at it i'll show you the fixtures okay. Now you can see this mirror has got these clips. And so i need to have two positions for the screws right it's going to be interesting okay guys. So because not everybody's going to be interested in mirrors. And lights. And all that sort of stuff we're going to make that a separate video okay we're going to add that in you can watch all that next week right. Now let's go get into the  connecting of all the plumbing we'll drop in the faucets. And the sinks. And we'll get all that hooked up. And check the water do that last water test. So then you know that at least you got your water taken care of. And you're not going to have any leaks. And then next week we'll show you how we finish all of the rest this w cheers when it comes time to do your plumbing on your vanity there's a lot of people who say oh you should attached the taps first before you put the countertop in. But if you saw us put that in can you imagine having two sets of taps. And foss it'ss in water supply lines on a 6ft vanity that's already a couple hundred lb. And try not to screw that up really difficult right. So it's i always prefer to be  uncomfortable when i'm doing my plumbing. Then take a risk of damaging everything while i'm trying to save a step anyway  turn off the water drain the lines we're going to do the water supply first. Then we're going to attach all the faucets. And then when that's done. Then we're going to connect all the drain okay you don't want to have the drain installed. And then be crawling up there upside down trying to tighten the faucet connections that'll drive you crazy. So do this in the right order. And it makes it simple first thing of course is we've drained the lines for a few minutes. Now we are going to squeeze. And turn. And there's always a little bit of water god help us all the more patient you are with draining your lines the less pressure will be in the system yeah that one's had more time to drain well. Now that that's out of the way i'm going to show you the easiest diy plumbing shut off valve system on the market i love this for a couple of reasons one it's just push connect shark bite shut off two it's just a 90° turn that's open when it's in line. And that's closed we don't need this cap. And i'm going to go answer the phone. And be right back these shut off valves also come in 90. So you can have it come out the water supply comes up. And then shut off valves on the front where i went shopping they were out of inventory i'll tell you right. Now ever since the storms in texas last year companies like sharkbite have had a horrible time keeping their stuff in inventory starting to get a little closer to normal. But sometimes you're just going to have to be flexible you're going to find the water supply r the water supply lines on the reell pro faucet that i buy are like 20 to 24 in. So they'll have no problem coming down. And looping back in a later date if i get a chance i might change it to ' 90s. But for. Now it's just nice to get it finished. So we're going to start off with these things in the closed position get rid of the decorative caps. And we simply are going to press. And twist all right you want to get about 1 in on this pipe back. So do yourself a favor. And set your thumb about an inch or. So back. So you know when you're almost there cuz that's not on okay this is on there you go all right. Now i know i'm installed that pipe got collapsed a little bit when i cut it it's a little oval you don't want to try to force the sh shark pipe on there like that make sure it's nice. And round if you want to make sure grab one of your solid copper rings. And slide it on that. And if it goes on without any difficulty. Then you're okay okay if you're fighting with it to get it on you're going to fight with the shark b. And you might cause damage to the fitting. And then it won't work get that on there here we go okay. So for ease of operation i'm right-handed i'm going to leave the shut off valves on the right okay there we go that's set up woohoo. Now we get to go. And assemble the faucets all right guys. So here's an 8 in faucet set give you an idea how it works you're going to have a water supply line. And then a redirect back to the the tap that comes out okay all right. And these are all deck mounted just a note when when my wife bought this vanity it was kind of like a hey honey i need this big this dimension two sn whatever i forgot to say if you can find one that has a countertop that has single hole all right. Then the faucets are really affordable when she went on the way for a site majority of these countertops had three holes drilled in it i don't know why the cabinet en counter people are in cahoots with the plumbing industry. But it takes three times as much effort to drill three holes as it does to do one okay. And guaranteed any faucet you buy you can put on this counter because they do make single hole faucets that have a huge plate right. But who wants a huge plate if it was only one hole you could get a single hole faucet as it is this is three times the price. And i had two of them i'm. So blessed. So words to the wise when you're shopping if you're worried about your budget get a single hole for your sink anyway this is a great demonstration how to hook up a sink because you get a whole lot more knowledge there's a lot of parts a lot of assembly okay most of it is actually a lot simpler than it looks all right  we're just going to go through this we don't need these i've done these faucets a thousand times i've been using reell pro for 15 years maybe 12 god it feels like forever max it feels like forever. So let's just go through all the parts we'll just kind of like  install them from the top first okay that's your water supply line i was talking about right that's going to have no problem connecting to that shut off valve down there. Now before we can drop it in the hole we need something to keep it from falling all the way through just a word of warning when you're undoing your pack packaging see these little here these little chrome stoppers they're in a separate bag it's not garbage don't throw that out they go in here afterwards okay what you're going to do is you're going to take each one of these water supplies we're going to throw this over top okay. And it's going to thread go backwards there you go till it makes a click noise spin it down a little bit get out of the way. Now on this you're going to see the little flat section okay that goes on the top all right. And you're going to thread that down until it doesn't thread anymore just finger tight nice. And easy okay that's your stop. Now you can adjust this over time. But you want to have contact here. And i'll show you why okay here's your handle. And it just sits right on right in that boom okay this space here is what guarantees no rubbing all right if you don't sink it down far enough. And then you install it you actually make contact with the ring. And you're going to get grinding. And noises you don't want that okay. So fingertight all until it stops. And then back this plate up to it. Now you're ready to install it okay make sure this gasket is in its rightful position. And is there anything on this about left. And right or hot. And cold yes these are marked okay. So this is hot line okay. And the reason you want to have this all marked is because these faucets will open. And close counter like in different directions if you put them on the wrong side they'll still function. But then your taps will look weird okay get these. And that sits here boom well that's pretty much installed same thing from over here. Now let's put the bottom on the reason the flat section you want it top. So if you ever have to do maintenance on this or replace it you can put your pliers. And grab the flat spot. And you can loosen off that connection after it's been there for a while trust me you're going to need the pliers okay it only works great out of the box there we go. Now that one's ready to go in that's the cold supply. Now the next stage is we do from underneath the rubber gasket it's like a hat it's got a ridge on the top all right that's designed to go into this hole that's it's a universal hole okay. So it goes into the hole in the granite. And sits flush this is perfect all the countertop people are making the same size hole out there okay. So we take that it goes underneath the counter this gets up. And then we thread this on from underneath. And when you do this you want to back off the screws here a little bit okay this will thread up from underneath. And then you'll have this connection here. Then you take a drill with a drill bit. And you can tighten this. And it creates compression against the thread on here. And the countertop. And that's what keeps the handle from moving around okay. So make sure you get the right screwdriver bit. And make sure you give yourself lots of room here to create that compression. Now i got to crawl underneath. And get this done. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to install it upside down in the counter. So you can see easily all right you take your washer with the with the top of the hat pointing the counter top okay. Now there we go that just starts to make a lot more sense. Now doesn't it if you don't see the assembly it's going to be difficult. Now the same thing where that sticker should is in the way h okay same thing go backwards until it sits in the in the groove you don't want to risk cross threading this because if it's cross threaded you're done right. Now you've made good contact i could tighten it up a little bit more. But i want to have the screws on each side because that's really easy for me to get a hold of with my drill grab yourself a 6in drill bit okay cuz when you're underneath the it's really easy to just go like this okay you see how much of that moved it's a fine thread it's like an 832 make you good torque or two on there okay. Now that's not going anywhere. Now that's exactly what i'm going to do put from underneath on my bag. Now that we've got that set up just to recap this is a quick connect okay. So this just pops in there. And then the two shorter lines just pop in here. Now your water supply is connected to your faucet that's the easy part we have this lovely little fitting here as well. And this is set up. So that it could swivel if you want or you can set it up with the washer nut system from underneath all right. And set it in place which is what i'm going to do should just sit there going to crawl down one more time. And i'm going to take my tiny little wrench with me  they make little plastic wrenches for plumbers right sometimes you can buy it has a kit. And it'll just be a little plastic gray thing that comes in there. And you can just throw a screwdriver make a wrench out of it it's not really needed i'm going to crawl under here. And connect that. And then connect the water supply  yeah i'm getting too old for this scrap max here we go just right on the shoulder blades is nice because if this was particle board i'd probably destroy it cuz i'm a little bit overweight if you didn't notice okay here we go just like the other one rubber gasket first. Then the brass plate. Now i can look up through the drain hole. And see the faucet. And kind of guess what square is this is a great time to have somebody working with you you can have them up there holding the faucet while you tighten the ring ring on you can see why you don't want to have your p trap. And everything installed right. Now right cuz everything will be in the way. So very important to do this in the right order all right one of the benefits if you're working [applause] alone intentionally have it out i've squared just a little bit when i'm done tightening this on. And i go back up. And i i i straighten that out it'll be enough force to scra straighten that out that i'll be comfortable it's not ever moving again okay i think i'm good with that all of the water supplies okay. So cold line in one side just snap it in as far as it goes hot the other you see everything moves freely okay. Now we're just going to go press it up right into the old there we go woohoo the secret here is make sure everything's nice. And looped. And not kink next thing of course before we do the p trap let's get these water supply lines on these are standard 3/8 water supply it's the same everywhere you go whenever you buy  shut offs they come in 3/8 threaded or they come in quarter inch threaded okay. And qu in is for fridge lines 3/8 is for anything to do with your faucet in the bathroom. So make sure you get the right one once you finger tightened it always take a little wrench with you okay grab it. And give it at least another good quarter turn fingertight means you've engaged the little washer in here. And it is little okay. Now if you've got lots of line. And you want it to go like this what you can do is you can actually loop it in some cases like this. And then add a twist tie to it keep it out of the way okay i'm not going to worry about that for. Now i think in this particular situation i'm more likely to go out. And get the different shut off valves later. But i'm going to deal with it for. Now because well it ain't no big deal to change a shut off valve there we go. So see that i can i can kind of twist everything out of the way i can put a twist tie on that if i need to to get it out of the way no big deal for. Now okay okay. But right. Now we're going to deal with this remember when we did the drain we said we're not going to glue that this is why next step is the drain assembly. Now you'll see this it's the same thing everything has a nut in a washer right here we go this is all for down here this is all to be assembled after the fact. And this is how it works this goes into the bottom of the sink like that this this is a teflon ring that goes in between the metal. And the rubber because these these the thread on the pipe is not level it's on an angle. And so when you put all this together when you're tightening this up really hard you'll have one point of contact that has the most pressure. And then it's reduced on both sides okay it's on an angle. And if i just go without that teflon right up against the rubber what happens it'll grab it. And it'll go. And it'll pinch. And then you'll have a leak. So this is just to help make sure that there's no no grab it's. So slippery that you can put incredible amount of tension that even though it's on an angle it'll be tight all the way around okay. And it won't kink on you. So make sure you put that assembly properly one. Then two. Then three all right  one of the reasons i love reel pro is because they always have a gasket on their drains you don't have to make your own out of plumbers putty okay this is set up for a typical sink that has an overflow on it right. So that the the drain is the drain is going to connect it about this level. And there's a huge gap here for the overflow in the sink to to operate drop that in place. And the plumbing up top is finished. And we'll just slide all three of these components on till we get to the brass ring. And then we just crank it over there. Now i've already got a good seal here. But it's still wiggling around right that's what i was talking about that whole one point of contact. So i'm going to just use my crescent wrench you bugger it's not going to get big enough seriously stupid all right sorry crescent i can't give you compliments on that wrench all right i'm going to just take my little wrench here. And we're going to just work this around a little bit you can see how it's really almost closed here. But bigger on the gap on this side we're just going to keep on doing this until we have solid contact all the way around okay. Now my gaskets got solid contact with both sides of the sink i know i'm going to be good we our plumbing we have an abs system here okay here's our p trap it's standard for a sink because it has a drain on it okay. So if you ever lose a ring or something you can just open the drain put a bucket underneath to grab it. And you can drain it all out okay. And it has this release as well. Now it sits in here like this if you ever get leaks where you get rotted out stem here on your old sink  if you get hair clogs it'll cause the metal to rust out real prematurely you can actually disconnect. And then just get a new p trap. And then reconnect it okay just a little something there to help people out all right wrap the threads again plumbing on plumbing plastic on plastic you run the risk okay of a bad joint. And so this is less of a a lubrication. And this more of a sealant take the time to add it okay we're going straight front. And back. So we'll set it up like that really lightly at this point okay there nothing worse than when you do new plumbing to have a customer call you back i was in that warranty department for that renovation company for a while couldn't believe how many times get warranty for plumbing plumbing plumbing plumbing i think the plumber they were using was just really big contract company they're always just cutting corners to get things done because they only gave a 30-day warranty of course the renovation company had a 2-year warranty. So we did nothing. But plumbing repairs all the time all right. Now when not i'm going to check the back here where that pipe is you see the height that that's sitting at okay if i bring that out. And i add this right. Now i'm still too low. So now we're just going to walk through real quick the assembly that you're going to need to connect these drains if you do it in the right order it makes it really simple first thing you want to do put your your p trap here okay where the bottom is. And imagine this is glued to the very bottom of it all right if i go like this because i want to have this stem somewhere in closer to the bottom here okay i don't want to have it just barely making contact with the top if i go where i want it the back of the p trap is higher than the drain okay it's higher than that connection. So now i know that i'm going to have a piece of pipe added in here the only way that we can measure that is really simple we'll just start from the front. And we'll work our way to the back this has a washer ring okay. And then this part threads over top. And creates compression. And when it's loose it can't grab the pipe okay. But when you tighten it on it creates really good seal. So it's not moving that is what we want. So we're going to rough toate here just going to use the existing pipe stick it in the back dry fit no glue. And i'm going to go i would like this seal up here somewhere this is really nice for me. So now i'm going to measure down to my. And i'm going to cut the pipe that goes about 3/4 of the way inside each fitting okay. So we'll go like this. And i think 3. And 1/2 is plenty okay. And you know me when i'm measuring pipe i always go on the printed side 3. And 1/2 is at the u to the d on there we go okay remember this fitting this pipe cutter here the melt the join line here this here that's my that's where it's going to cut. So i put it right on that u to the d. And then i stab it. And then i twist it i got a perfect cut nice. And clean okay. So that gives me that assembly. And now we'll take this out of the wall get rid of this temporary loosen this off. Now we're going to glue all of this together okay. So you want to glue the fitting. And the pipe. And i'll tell you why we use the word glue here. But this is a solvent. So basically it's melting the two pieces right. Now and when i stick them together. Then they will when the solvent stops acting. And and reacting it takes about 30 seconds it'll just be an instant sealed bond okay. And it's guaranteed never to leak as long as you're working with everything clean. And new. And you put the solvent on both pieces i know lots of guys out there who only put solvent on one side there we go little bit of a twist just to make sure everything's activated good to go. Now that's ready okay. Now now we can put this back on okay. And now we can measure from inside the back fitting right from there okay up to this point right here okay about about 3/4 again all right. Now this is going to get a little awkward. And the fitting to there is 4. And a2 all right let's see if maybe that'll work well that one's five that's just too close to be able to do that 4. And 1/2 just to the d line it up stab. And twist. Now the reason i didn't cut it on that piece is i'm only taking a/ an inch off it's really hard for this thing to do a good job with half an inch okay just experience. So that's why i grabbed the new piece okay. Now this is where this gets interesting because we're going to glue this fitting that fitting both both ends of this pipe at the same time. And connect it all. And the way we do that is you just loosen this collar up a little bit okay. So there's flexibility all right there we go okay i'm going start in the back give that a run give this a run get a little more both ends of the pipe oh got my finger that's nasty okay i'm going to stick it in here. And then i'm going to go like this going to lift it up into position exactly where i want it. And then i'm going to just give it a bit of a lift. And then i'm going to twist this tight. Now i'm going to tighten this collar hand tight again okay don't want to go grabbing a wrench or anything remember what i said if you put too much torque on a plastic thread you cause it to go from round to oval. And that's when they leak here we go. So now that i have the drain connected i'm going to up my cold water line i have no idea knowing if the taps are open or closed at this point. And good for them they shipped it closed. Now i can just okay. So now we know these taps are going to get installed that way okay. And then to turn them on you forward there's going to be a lot of water in this all right. Now there's two stages to testing your drain assembly one is just run in cold water all right by itself with the sink open. And you just go both 30 seconds get a good flow going basically what we're doing is we're filling up the p trap causing water. And if there's any gaps or leaks the water will work its way through all the cracks. And then it'll start to drip. So this can take a couple of minutes all right. And that'll test this joint this joint the glued joints here all right. But it won't test the collar because this is higher than the rest of the drain. So okay the way you test the collar is you have to fill the sink up with water all right. So i plug the sink. And then once your sink is full. Then you can just unplug it. And it be such a large volume of water right away if this is not tight. Then it'll. Then it'll leak oh. And that's just running really smooth. Now when you're doing your own plumbing at home the amount of time i just did the leak test is no good it's not acceptable for abs plumbing okay because we have threaded fittings. And compressions what i suggest is leave the cold water running on this bad boy grab a couple paper towels stick it underneath. And if anything drips it'll show up real easy let it go 10 or 15 minutes all right give it a good test because if there's just a little hairline where the water can work through it can take quite a while before it shows up. And in most cases a little leak like that will you just got to give it a little bit of little bit of a twist to tighten it up okay or it'll seal itself just because of all the debris in the water supply system okay there we go that's done. Now let's finish off the handles up top all right i'm going to show you a little secret here watch this handle that's where you want it right down near the bottom okay this one it's not going all the way down it's because i haven't adjusted the set screw in here yet. Now i've got my precision tool kit here i know that it's a 2 and2 mm or is it there it is you have to open the set screw up. So you can see the blue till you see that blue there okay. And that's like a thread sealer. And then you know. Now it drops all the way down okay. And then you stick your precision tool in there. And you tighten up that thread once you have it in place okay. Now this handle is just a little bit off i want it here. So now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back underneath the sink i'm going to use the long drill bit i'm going to loosen those two screws. And i'm going to turn the tower just a little hair. And then tighten them up again that'll square it all off that's exactly where i want it. And then tighten them back up again. And that is why it's made that way okay you can have it perfect every time all right there we go only thing left of course if you found the package. And you didn't throw it out decorative caps okay. And they just slide in underneath. And it goes in like this guys. Now it's just like under compression right. Now if you need to get access to this handle in the future you grab your al knife okay you get underneath here. And you can go like this. And just pry it out of there okay there we go tada. Now you just got to do,https://youtu.be/WQI6ZTrfq4Q?t=6752,[]

And just pry it out of there okay there we go tada. Now you just got to do that twice hey guys in this video we're going to deal with how to finish off your renovations specifically in a bathroom  we should have enough skill sets by the time i'm done this video that you can hang just about anything or install just about anything anywhere in your house we're going to deal with some electricals some gfi some plugs light fixtures we're going to deal with mirrors we're going to deal with faucets we're going to deal with anything you have to attach to the wall really okay. So we're going to have a bunch of different processes we're going through drywall we're going through tile we're going to do just about everything you can ever need to do we're going to show you how to use the basic hand tools to get all this done all right. And then you can be competent. And install anything moving forward this should be a lot of help it'll be pretty condensed hopefully you going to learn something new for the first time here. So let's just jump right in this  generally speaking i like to work from the top down which means lighting. And that is easy because if i do the lighting. Then i can turn the lights on all right. So because we have the camera here today we have artificial lighting we have our own lights i'm not going to worry too much about that. So i'm going to install one of these light fixtures. And i'm also going to install a mirror. And i'm going to use a laser line for this okay because we are looking for perfection here whenever you're doing a project you want to use the center of your faucet to be exactly the distance middle distance between your light fixtures all these kinds of things you really want to think end from the beginning frame everything put your boxes in with the end goal in mind okay. So right. Now we've got this all set up. So it's double snc two oval mirrors. And the gap between the light fixture. And each mirror edge is exactly the same all along this wall. So i think we're going to get a great finish this is my center line i've lined it up on the sink here. And what we're going to do is well what's easier for the camera i'll get on this side of the line how's that. So i've already measured this off to be exactly center of between the two light boxes. And it's right on my tap which is what it should have been  if you're not sure how i came to that conclusion you can watch the previous video on how to go from a single to a double sink okay pretty sure we cover all the information about how to line up your boxes going to put a reference mark here just in case i end up kicking the light as i go along okay. So this is our mirror it's nice oval see that's why i put that pencil on there i'm going to want to have that for reference. So we will put that back. And straddle that okay what i'm doing. Now is i'm just going to go. And look for what looks the best right i don't need to see the ceiling. And i'm  510. And a 12 5'11 in my dad's shoes all right. So i'm going to bring it down just a bit this is good my thumbs are actually about 2 in below where the the electrical box is i like that i can see everything i'm wearing i can see right to the countertop i think that's going to work out well. So we're going to keep that in mind. And we're going to take a look at the light fixture that hole mounts right in the middle of the box. And the light centers a little bit below this. So that means the center line in this mirror should be about an inch. And a half below the box. So that's a good spot right okay. Now what i can do with my laser is i can raise this bad boy up. And the reason i love to use this is because i'm doing more than one mirror if you're only doing one mirror you can do all kinds of cheating here. But when you're doing two you got to have a system that you can duplicate cuz you can see the hooks on the back here these are designed to put in two screw plugs in the wall. And you hang it on the screw there's not a lot of mercy here. So you got to get this pretty dead on. Now there's my laser line about 2 in below the box we're going to call that the center okay. So now i'm going to find the center of my mirror about there okay i'm going to put a line all right here we go from that line i'm going to go 9 in. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to measure up 9 in from here this is going to be the height of my hooks. And this is my center line right here we go. And my hooks my screw heads are going to be seven. And 3/4 in apart well that's just brilliant. So let's change this again bathrooms are always. So much fun because there's never enough room in here to really function okay 7. And 5/8 if you're not good with math you take your 7. And 5/8. And you just fold your tape over okay. And then you can read right there is 3. And 7/8 okay. So i'm going to put 3. And 7/8 on my red line make a mark 7. And 5/8 make my other mark there we go. Now all i got to do is make sure that that line is level. And i don't need a laser for that there we go there. And there. Now the only other thing you need to know. Now is if there's a stud there. And if we don't have a stud. Then we know we need a wall plug. So you put your stud finder fl against the wall. And then you press the button. And when it says ready which is the green light you start sliding there's a stud there. So i'm right on the edge of a stud that's going to be tricky. And wow i have another stud here very unique huh. So whether it's a stud or some other obstruction i'm not exactly sure i know my plumbing is in the center of the wall. And it's horizontal here for the vents. And i'm not sure what's going on there. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to do an exploratory hole with i'm going to use my my robertson bit this is a safe way to check there's nothing here that's sharp enough to penetrate a plumbing line or electrical line. And do damage. So since we're not sure we're just going to start like this yeah right off the edge okay. And then this if i'm putting in a screw there it's going to go. And it's going to be be very very unique here i actually have stud in this case i don't need w pl what i do need to do is just put a plug here. And leave about  3/16 of space between the head of that screw. And the wall. So that that hook can go on. And over here i'm going to cheat i'm going to drill in an angle. So i get positive contact with that stud. And the goal is to have that screw head line up where i want it when i'm done bam loving that all right. Now there are two ways to mount these mirrors right you can take a airline wire. And you can buy a little mirror hanging kit at the store. And you wrap it around each end. And then you only put one screw in the middle. And then you can set your mirror on. And you can level it off. And that works great. But when you have two you can't do that because they'll never be level. So this is why we've got to do it the oldfashioned hard way what you want to do is get your fingers on here if it's stiff enough you can set them like that. And forget it great stand to the side just line them up there we go boom. But that's going to work great. But the the secret here is taking this information. And transferring it over there. So what we have to do before we move forward okay is get this horizontal line on again. And we want to take this information. And we were 9 in above yes. And i want to come over here off the center mark i want to mark my 9 in above okay. And then i'm going to want to bring my laser level over off the center hole mark this get a center line measure both directions again. And do the same thing okay. Now let's move on to the light fixture i already know because this is my house. And i wied this that the power goes with that box. Then that box. Then over here. So i'm starting at the end i'll work my way back over there. And when i'm doing the the first light in this series i'll double check make sure the switch is off. So i don't have any power in it right. Now i don't know. But because it's not connected i know there's no power in this. So just as a precursor. So you know i'm not working crazy with the power on not that that makes me nervous. But for today's video we'll assume i'm saying all right here we go this particular fixture comes with a few elements always open up your packaging before you go install you'll never find light bulbs in a light fixt your box in most cases okay. So we've got lens we've got the mount with the wiring. And we've got a mounting bracket okay. And then this little ring here is what's used to tie all these together. And once it's connected. Then you add the bulb afterwards. So let's just go through the process first of all we're going to need a roberts. And screw bit which we have because these screws are the mounting screws for this plate. And what we want to do is bring the wi through the middle nice. And easy there we go. And because we're mounting through the middle off this bracket anywhere where we can set this where it's going to install easily we're going to go with okay you don't have to go with one of the little holes you can use one of the big ones. And adjust it over time doesn't really matter these brackets are designed to be incredibly functional. And and actually incredibly versatile you can even mount this round box on an old rectangular box. And turn that into a light if you get if you need to all right because it has all these different options for mounting here we go. So i got my neutral i got my power. And i got my ground. And for good measure we're going to back out the ground screw. And then tighten it on if you wire clockwise. And you tighten clockwise everything tightens when you use the drill if you put it on the wrong side it'll all just fire right out of it okay you're going to run into all kinds of trouble look at this this is cute eh like i was saying earlier you don't want to be doing all your fixtures. And stuff until your paint has been drying for a couple of days it needs to harden every time something bumps into it it'll make a dent or a scratch or mark. And you can't wash it off remember you can't wash your washable paint on your walls until 30 days after you paint cuz that's how long it takes it to cure before you can wash oh jeez careful jeff careful here we go. So you can see how i'm wrapping it around that wire a lot trying to guarantee positive contact long term after this install is over hey that's enough of that there boy all right here we go. Now going to take this wire. And i'm going to do that as well i know this is overkill because these screws make this plate grounded to the box. But you know going a little overkill isn't going to hurt anybody in this situation. Now you really want to figure out where your wires are going to go here okay. And you want to kind of connect everything around free from obstruction. And this is only 1 qu inch thick. And i've got almost an inch of this threaded rod sticking out. So we're going to tighten it back up. And i'm going to stick this on why is that only going in there we go almost cross threaded that max that would really sucked okay. So i have another problem here that i'm going to have to deal with. Now can you imagine can you guess anybody guess in the comment section that's right i used a pan box. And for whatever reason they decided to give us a 3in bolt for mounting this box like that's the bolt needs to be an inch long here looks like it's making contact with the ground wire in there let's move that out of the way there we go. Now we should be able to get enough of that thread it in there to make enough room all right sometimes the thickness of the ground wire is all that it takes i'm liking my odds here yes sir how was it. Now we're going to polish this up this is a great time to check for stickers by the way the sticker is actually on the ring sometimes it's on the light fixture. And it'll have a sticker is telling you information about the light bulbs you can use you want to remove that sticker as soon as possible in the old days we used to have incandescent light bulbs. And got really warm. And those stickers would always leave a nasty residue if you turn the lights on before removing them electricians are famous for not removing stickers off of light fixture. So be careful about that all right as it turns out i bought some led light fixtures light bulbs holy crap are these every very huge that's a lot of bulb just wanted 60 watts i didn't realize i had to get something as big as my car there we go that's the light fixture installed yay  i would show you at work. But we'll show you in the end of the video okay we we make sure that we do an aftershot of the whole room. So you get the whole idea here we go on the next fixture we don't want to waste any of your time. So regular well plug  we got a lot of wire here okay going to grab the end. And all you do is turn it it creates a nice hook okay it's easy to work with this okay you set it on one side of that box. And you can pinch the wire shut. And then you just tighten it on okay piece of cake. Now generally on almost every fixture you get the screws on the side with the ground are always the whites all right. And brass. And black okay white. And the silver. So the way you remember this is the brass brass. And the black o together i think i did a video of this before. And i got that wiring combination screwed up i wasn't always incredibly comfortable on camera my brains would scramble here we go. So we're going to have this is part of a circuit. So this power's coming in. And going out all right. So generally what i like to do is do the whites first okay again you pinch the end. And you curl a hook into it all right. Now i not a master electrician by any stretch. But let's just be honest you don't need to have a master electrician to wire a receptacle any more than you need an engineer to drive a car down the street this stuff is not that tricky. And anybody who's doing their wiring wrapping the wire around the screws is already miles ahead as far as integrity is concerned cuz on the back they have these little holes push. And play like you can just push the wire in there i'm telling you right. Now if you want to do a nice wiring job at your house don't use those holes yes they're convenient wow that's really long yes the holes are convenient. But they are known to fail get a loose connection. And then you can't ever pull them back out you have to cut them off which means you have a live piece of wire sticking out of the back when you go in the box next time. And you increase the risk of problems. And starting fires. And all that business just put a wire on a screw all right. And stop being lazy if you spend your whole career. And you stop one fire from happening as an electrician because you do this versus the plug-and play it was worth the time you took okay let's do this  talk to me are you the  oh my god light upside down or are you more like this kind of look which do you prefer i like to make them look like a face for whatever reason the  the human brain recognizes that. And it finds it more aesthetically pleasing if you think i'm wrong let me know. But i've had long conversations with people about this before there is no actual right way. And wrong way here all right the secret is you push it to the wall. And then you tighten it up okay [music] don't overtighten because you'll push this too far inside. And then the wall plate won't cover nice speaking of wall plates if you do a decent job with your drywall. Then you won't need to use oversized plates you can get the normal size if however you have too big of a hole because of your remodel okay you don't like that you can always push him around just a little bit there we go got to love a good alin knife as long as you got a knife knife on you you never need a screwdriver. And again the screws go vertical okay aesthetically pleasing okay. Now we can jump on to the faucet before we do we'll talk real quick about the gfi all right okay gfi all right they have a few different versions out here the idea is  if something horrible goes wrong it turns itself off that's all you need to know as a homeowner on the back again you got brass. And you got silver you got a ground screw. And you have this little tape on section okay if you're only bringing a single pair of wires a black. And a white you wire it right here. And if you want the circuit to continue from here you remove the yellow tape. And you put the black. And the white here. And that carries on to the next fixture wow that was complicated huh listen the technology is all in the switch you don't have to know anything different  that plug down there cost $1.95. And this one cost $28 you got to trust the technology don't wire it backwards or you most likely will kill it. And then you have to spend another 30 bucks for a new one they're a little bit sensitive let's just set these wires up. Now this is contrary to common sense this one's actually live  i'm just not in the mood to go downstairs. And do this right. Now we are going to wire the whole switch right up to the last live wire. And we'll do that one at the end all right again we'll do the ground first oh neat all right my bad these don't need hooks see that max these have got a  a big brass plate. And the screw released makes hold to slide the the wire straight in cut them all back again. And we're just going to go with whatever the recommended distance is for this nice not too long you don't want to have exposed wires sticking out of the back of the box well this is actually going to be a lot more entertaining than i thought. So you have to hold it upside down in order to release the plate. And then you can turn it over tighten the screw good. Now we're going to do the two whes. Now this is the one with the power okay. And this is the one where the power comes in okay. And we interesting system they got here all right. Now both of these screws are all the way through to the other side of the brass all right flip it over okay. Now it's time for some safety precautions because we're going to deal with a live circuit i'm going to wrap all of the screws in electrical tape okay perfect loving it. And here's the reason why if you touch a live wire you don't electrocute yourself cuz there's no circuit until it connects to the neutral. So if i can't come in contact with the neutral wire i can't complete the circuit loving it eh. So now we're going to take the live power off. And we're going to cut it back a little bit cuz it's a little long we're going to treat it with a healthy amount of respect here if anything goes wrong here it's on me. So what i want to do is get rid of this i'm going open that gate up okay i'm holding the tab at the end cuz these two are always safe even in a live situation okay good all right. Now let's hit the reset button. And a little light should turn on oh i guess the power wasn't on after all right on okay i'll have to go down. And turn the breaker on always better to treat it like the power's on. Then you'll never have to worry about someone like let's say a one of your sons going downstairs. So they go downstairs. And they go oh that one's not working that must be mine yeah that happens. So the other thing you can do is have a little proximity tester little green stick on you or something all right. So i just threw my laser level on the the mouth of that plug. And it's on the mouth of that plug. So the boxers are perfectly level what we have here is going to be really common this countertop is not installed level there's a nasty slope it comes with these beautiful big feet on it that didn't give us the ability to level it off to perfection what we have is flat stable. And pretty darn level as a result this plug is a quar inch lower towards the countertop than this side. And i have a stone backsplash. So although it looks great it's going to be an issue as soon as i put the back on. So what i've got to do got to raise this bad boy up because i need 4 in of clearance right. Now i only have 3. And 7/8 okay. So now i get to show you how to fix this as a diy renovator you're going to want to follow a lot of these little tips. And little systems that i use okay here's one of my systems that i use when i mount my boxes i mount my boxes with one screw on a 45° angle from the middle going into the second hole all right here's why look at the size of this cover plate okay right i've got almost a/ an inch of mercy here that i can play with. So dig right in here mix. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to cut a drywall. So that i can raise the box. Now this particular box has got the set screws on the inside of the box which is brilliant. So when you're sho you got choices the boxes come with the set screw on the inside or there's a little flange on the top. And the bottom whatever you do make sure you always set it. So that you can maneuver it to a new [music] height okay. Now up we go right on okay again let's get the mouth working let's prebend the wires. So they collapse properly. And finish vertical. Now listen this is kind of like best case scenario everything's brand new everything's already flat. And level you know using a laser level works. But as soon as you have to start modifying things to fit a space like we did with the vanity. And you can watch that in the other video that we did about how to go from single to double vanity really this should not be that difficult for a screw eh okay here we go. Then you'll appreciate the amount of effort. And energy that goes into making this look good i'm only off half a degree maybe one degree tops over 6 ft. And then at the in is the difference between me doing what cutting the plate what's the other option here cut the stone i'm about to stick on no the option is lift this up. And make it look like it's set at the same height it's not going to be the end of the world it's still going to look perfect when you walk in. And nobody's going to walk into your bathroom with a laser go aha you're out of 16th of an inch. So there we go problem solved listen because we have lots of room we're going to do the backsplash. Then i'm going to add the silicone seal. And then i'm going to put the faucets in  why the heck not right let's just make life difficult for me we work top down. And back front  i would suggest usually most cases putting the faucet first. But i'm down for a challenge today. So i'm going to go get the backsplash. And i'm going to teach you how to mount this. And no you can't just use anything you got to use the right stuff. So let's just do a test on this first see how it looks that's upside down we really don't want to start in the wrong direction there's a polished. And an un polished edge here this is natural stone i think it's a quartz all righty look at that that's pretty darn awesome you can tell gravity does most of the work here right when you go to install. So anything that's a stone follow the same procedure like as if it's natural stone if you treat everything like marble you'll never make a mistake marble is porous different products have different paracity. And you can attach things with white silicone black silicone clear silicone pl premium. But sometimes the wrong combination of those adhesives will cause you to see the adhesive staining through the stone. And you'll end up with a big squiggly line. And then who's going to look like an idiot eh. So might i suggest the best process here is to just lay it down. And you don't even have have to get too close to the edge okay gravity is going to do most of the work here all right. And we're going to just slide it into place there you go. So i don't even know if i'm happy with that i might have to take this off. And just raise it up another quter inch to get a bit of a gap resist the temptation to press it into the wall most walls have got a bit of a bend. And a wave to it okay come back with your clear silicone. And just throw the tiniest little bead right against the top. And if the hole opens up just make it a wider bead the reason we're using clear is cuz it's a prepainted surface okay. And you'll see the paint through the the silicone after it dries. And you won't really be able to tell the gap. Now don't use just transparent the transparent stuff gets a little cloudy white. And it never looks as nice. But the clear always comes out looking more like a window like a piece of glass all right. And when you do this you want to have the side of the finger pressed against the wall. So that if it squeezes anywhere it squeezes onto in behind the stone okay you see the gaps unacceptable always managing your silicone. And your drips all right get a bigger hole. And then open up the w the hole that wide. And then just do a second pull close that gap if you fill it properly you won't get those shadows. And stuff from the product not making contact with the back of the stone in behind it i know that looks a little funny right. Now but let it dry. And it almost totally disappears that's how you fix an imperfect world clear silicone do not touch that again once you put silicone somewhere do not work above it for at least 24 hours all right or 12 like don't be nuts. But at least 12. Now we're also going to want to put a little bead right down here to prevent water from getting in between the backsplash. And the countertop. And this just a thin bead nice. And easy always managing the tip of that silicone this is where having the faucet here first is difficult trying to manage that look at all the difficulty i'm having here turn your f water on use your finger to drive it okay there we go. Now now we're going to move on to the other faucet in case you didn't see me. And sawall the faucet on the going from 1 to two vanity video okay we're going to do the quick version of this for the extended version you can watch the video where we went from not one vanity to two. But one sink to two sinks we changed the plumbing we opened the wall we did everything re-rooted it all right. So it's worth a watch because one of the ways you can increase the value home is if you have a single vanity in your master bath change it to a double his. And hers right easy money okay. So here we go i just tried to remove what i saw was a foreign obstacle in the drain it turned out to be a piece of that broken glass from that damn light i wanted to show you. So reached down. And pushed it with my finger. And guess what it didn't move. But the finger did that really sucked. And there we go i just sav $1,500 in hospital bills okay just joking i don't have to pay for mine up here. And i didn't want to rub it in here we go here's our faucet assemblies right all right when you're dealing with these widespread faucets there's always multiple parts make sure you consult with the  installation instructions. But for the most part you're going to have something like this you back up the bottom plate. So now you have something nice. And tight. And the handle goes on it makes something pretty with an eighth of an inch there. So there's no no rubbage when you're opening. And turning it okay piece of cake. And then we can thread on a washer from underneath they're marked hot. And cold all right. And then we have the faucet line which has got something similar going on right here like that there's no way to connect that. And hold it in place until afterwards yay this is the drain comes with the gasket for up top it's also threaded here okay here is a place i think i forgot to do that on the other video max anything that's threaded should have a joint compound okay. And it can be as simple as something like this been in that box man for months look at that comes out like brand new okay nothing too serious go backwards until it sits in the cradle there off we go to the races okay that's just to make sure that nothing leaks down the road  you can buy different tail pieces that's why it comes like that all right s different functions. So whatever is what it is we just drop that in the hole. And everything else we connect from underneath here's the  the the short. And skinny on it okay. So you drop that in. And then from underneath you put this other gasket on this way okay there's a hole in the sink that you want that wedge to fill. And it goes under compression by using a slip ring. And that. And then you tighten it all up okay. Now if you want to watch the whole ping assembly we've got it in the video for how to go from a single to a double sink i suggest you watch it's very detailed. And step by step. But just. So you know plumbing is pretty basic every time you buy a plumbing fixture it comes with instructions all right. And if you like these particular faucets they're very affordable reel pro put information in the video description. So you can find out where to get it where you live the good thing is is the faucet part here okay it's a push connect all right. And so the water supply hot. And cold go into the bottom here underneath the sink. And then you just push connect the top in all right it's about as simple a plumbing as you're going to find in the market. And this stuff works phenomenal let's just get it on make sure your handles go in horizontal you turn towards you that's why they're marked hot. And cold cuz they operate in the opposite function. So make sure you put the hot on the right side. And there's this lovely little set screws in here for the handles okay this little piece of packaging that looks like garbage keep it don't throw that out all right there we go there's the skinny woohoo okay. Now remember i showed you how to draw the lines over here for the other mirror i wanted to just put this one in because  real quick i got weirdly lucky with studs. And framing in the wall this one not. So lucky i missed it by half an inch. And this one there's nothing here okay. So in this case just going to take my phillips bit all right i'm going to put it right where the hole is that's it okay i'm going to punch a couple of holes in here i'm going to show you i get these at home depot okay these are actually one of the best wall drywall anchors out there. Now if you haven't seen it we do a video we're kind of making fun of drywall anchors because most of them don't work with their darn all right these actually do you collapse the middle. And you push the points over all right you stick them in that hole. And generally speaking they're bigger than your drill bit take your hammer. And sink them in nice. And flush they have that star grid on the backside it cuts the drywall okay. So they won't twist. So feel free to give them a good shot all right. And then inside the package they have this little red plunger okay. And it's skinny skinny skinny. And then it gets thick. And you want to put that plunger in there. And push it until the thick part goes all the way to the back maybe i'll just show you what happens to it. And what happens is it pushes the back out okay. And then when you put in the screw the screw goes all the way through the back. And then pulls it nice. And tight. And creates this crazy wedge all right that is a really good system. And i love it it's harder than you think sometimes there we go all right it takes a lot of force there we go. Now these are robertson imagine that wasn't expecting that to be a canadian pr. And then at the same time i shouldn't be surprised that the best plug system that i like is a canadian product all right okay one more quick time i haven't even checked to see. But because it's a robertson screw. And i'm thinking it's a canadian product i'm going to check to see if this is available on amazon if it is i'll put in the video description down below not too many robertson screw fixture products available in the states wow the back of this mirror is crazy sharp i almost want to wear gloves touching this thing it's what happens when you purchase stuff actually these weren't even on amazon my wife went bought these at the store there we go okay all right another reason to buy an oa knife right there makes your finger really long piece of cake right ah she's coming together well that was a lot of video  i'm going to suggest that if you're watching these a toz videos from here moving forward really suggest maybe you find a way to watch on on a really big tv we're filming this stuff in 4k ultra high definition right. Now which is blow your socks off kind of of film quality. So if you're in a place where you've got a good internet connection. And you can watch this on a 4k tv you're going to get to see different angles. And nuances that you aren't going to pick up if you're watching on your phone okay that's just the bottom line for best viewing experience you should check this out on your television just go to your smart television. And it'll be amazing. Now wanted to encourage you guys subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet. So you get the bell for notifications checked off the next video coming up is going to be the shower a toz. And we did a complete remodel tile over tile in that one all brand new products that you can get at your local home depot to solve the supply chain issues that we're having with everything else in the market. And if you're interested in what we're doing here in this 1880 farmhouse click the link over here. And join this from the very beginning we've got videos on how we transform the entire home the only thing we saved was the framing everything else in here is brand new hope you enjoy it you learned a lot you can do this yourself you can diy it.

And today i'm going to show you how to remove a toilet we've got this  existing kind of off-colored toilet in this bathroom. And we're going to remove it for our  dem demolition here. So one of the first things we want to do you don't need very many tools we,https://youtu.be/Pem0LVFZU4w?t=0,"['What is the purpose of removing an old toilet?', 'What are the necessary tools required for the removal process?', 'Why is the toilet being removed from the bathroom?', 'How does one safely remove a toilet?', 'What is the next step after removing the toilet?']"

So one of the first things we want to do you don't need very many tools we basically have a cresent wrench something to scoop some water i like some rubber gloves we need a rag. And a large garbage bag okay. So to start with i'm going to turn the water off hopefully you'll find on your  toilet you've got a valve right here a shut off valve if not you may have to go down. And turn off the main water to the home. Then i'm going to actually flush the toilet as well once the water's been turned off. And this is mostly. So i can drain the tank. And get as much water out of the toilet as i can. And as well previously before we started i  cleaned the toilet because  there's nothing worse than working on a toilet. And you basically have your head right here where the business working end of everything is. So so i'm just going to slip on these gloves. And then what we're going to do is  i'm going to scoop some of the water out of the bowl that's left in the bowl because in the process of moving the toilet around once you've got it free from the floor some of that water can  work its way out of the trap. And drip. And make a mess. So i'm just going to do a bit of scooping here to just have my bag close by we're going to actually place the toilet right in the bag as well which will take care of some of the water. And mess that you end up with. But so basically just drain it down as far as you can maybe hold that lever on the back the toilet down too to drain as much out of the tank as you could if you had a a shop vac that's a wet dry vac if you wanted to you could bring it in. And actually suck the water right out that'd be a great thing to do. But usually doesn't take long just to scoop a bit of whatever out with a dixie cup or whatever you got maybe you got a red solo cup left over from your big party the night before or whatever anyways just need something to scoop that out of there.

So we've got that drained right down as low as we can i'm just going to take the top off just. So it's not in our way. And there really isn't much water left at all in that tank. So we're going to be good that way. So you can  you can remove the water supply line one or two ways you can either remove it right down here right from  where it hooks onto the valve or the pipe or right up here where hooks onto the tank i'm going to take it off right at the bottom just because we're  not reusing this line either when we  rebuild the bathroom. So i'm just simply using a cresant wrench to get that all loose  this toilet has a braided line which is a little newer style line that you see more often on the toilets. Now yours might have a plastic tube regardless it'll it'll unhook at either end as well couple more turns here. And we should have the water line off there we go. And i should have explained that there was going to be a bit of water in there. So if you're trying to save your floor or something just have a rag handy there to soak that up usually that not quite that much comes out of there okay. So we got that free. Now the other thing we need to do is pop off these caps. So you might might need a flat bar or something to do that screwdriver pop that cap off on each side some toilets may have another bolt  up on the side. So if there's a couple different caps there or whatever. Then there's likely a bolt under each one this one just has two bolts again i'm just going to use the cresant wrench you can see the nuton bolt here this is what attaches it right to the  toilet flange that's in the floor attached to the meain drain plumbing. So just get these all undone. And if you're  installing a different toilet like if you're taking this one off. And pitching it  i would recommend that you well either way even if you're reusing this toilet i would usually use a new bolt a nut. And everything. But especially if you're using a new toilet cu it may need to be a different length anyways  you can check out our  installing a toilet video to see that process of actually installing a new [music] toilet. So i don't know if you seen that when i  took this one off if you have a plastic cap on that covers up that bolt. So you pop that cap off take the nut off. Then you're going to find that you have usually a metal type washer. And a plastic washer take those both off the plastic washer was just on there for this cap to snap onto okay. So that's on  i've got the metal one down here still for some reason these ones reversed. But usually the metal ones on top okay. So we've got that.

So we've got that. Now the other thing you may find in some situations is that the  toilet has been siliconed or cocked to the flooring. So we're just going to run a knife blade around a bit of water laying there. So i can soak that up i wasn't expecting quite. So much to be in that supply tube there i have a feeling that this toilet possibly will find that it had been leaking for a little while because the floor seems to be kind of indented here which indicates that the floor was a little soft probably from water damage. So just cut around cut that silicone free from the flooring. Now we should be able to lift that toilet up. And like i said with the garbage bag i'm going to lift the the toilet up you need a pretty good size bag for this i'm going to lift the toilet up,https://youtu.be/Pem0LVFZU4w?t=360,"['What type of material is used to seal the toilet to the floor?', 'How do you remove silicone from flooring?', 'Why is the floor soft and indented under the toilet?', 'What is the purpose of using a large garbage bag when lifting a toilet?', 'Can water damage cause the floor to become soft and prone to indentation?']"

And try to set the base right into the bag that way i've kind of got it contained. So if it does want to leak or drip or anything  it doesn't make a mess as we carry it out through the house okay. So now to get this off it usually shouldn't take much of a pull if you' got all the bolts off  i just kind of straddle it grab on right here at the back side of the seat just give it a little wiggle. And it should come right up set it into the bag. And i'll just pull the bag up around the base like. So i'm just going to move this off to the side out of the way a little bit. So we can see what you have left behind whoops. So what we've got left behind here is  yeah there's definitely been some rot actually i pull that floor up a bit you'll be able to see. And see how soft. And ugly that floor is. So at some point this toilet was leaking or something was leaking. So anyways once you pull your toilet up what you're going to have left is you're going to have the toilet flange which is this kind of black ring on the floor this yellow goopy looking stuff is a is a wax ring which makes the actual seal between the toilet. And that plastic   toilet flange. So then what i do is just have a bag or garbage or something here scrape that all all that old wax off or as much as you can into the bag. And then  after that you also pull these bolts out the bolts  this is just a slotted hole in that plastic ring. So once you get a hold of them everything's kind of gooped up here come on here we go. So your rings will pull out that's just wax stuck all over it there pull your your  bolts out. And even if this  toilet's going to not be off that long i'll usually just take a rag. And stuff it down into the hole you don't want it to fall down in there. But stuff it in there. So it's nice. And tight just to block some gases from coming up cuz that'll be directly hooked right to your  main sewer line. So there's definitely going to be some sewer gas coming up through there. And you don't want that coming back into your house. So so we got that  all off there isn't much more i can show you other than that. So now we're just going to carry that toilet out. And discard it. So thanks for watching like i said you can check out our video on installing a new toilet show you kind of the reverse process  some toilets  will come all pre assembled when you buy them new some don't.

Now restoring or repairing that texture may seem challenging. But actually it's easier than you may think wall texture is intended to hide wallboard joints. And other imperfections usually it's supplied with some sort of spray equipment during construction frequently the need to repair or restore wall texture occurs when a section of the wall board itself has been replaced because of damage or repairs there are actually several different styles of wall texture. But two of the most popular are knockdown. And orange peel knockdown involves flattening the peaks left by a sprayon finish. And orange peel resembles the skin texture of this popular citrus fruit hx makes an aerosol product for creating both styles even though applying wall texture is a fairly straightforward process there are a number of variables that can come into to play air pressure material volume distance from the nozzle to the wall. And spray pattern can all affect the final appearance for this reason the hx aerosol applicator head has two important adjustments this one for air pressure. And this one to control the volume of material the best way to match an existing wall texture is to experiment on a piece of scrap cardboard,https://youtu.be/SG1YaFjG1XA?t=0,"['What types of imperfections are usually hidden by wall texture?', 'Why do sections of wall board need to be replaced?', 'How does knockdown and orange peel differ from each other?', 'What factors can affect the final appearance of wall texture?', 'How should you match an existing wall texture?']"

And tricks that you need to maintain one of the most let's just face it neglected parts of the house the dryer exhaust [music]. So the dryer exhaust lovely it's a simple concept really is just a lease these are brittle it's garbage it sits in the uv. And the sun all day long it dries out. And then the animals start to get at it right because they want to make a hole in this thing especially in the fall whew what a warm place to live usually just goes through the cavity of the wall which is why they come with this little extension piece. So that i'll cover a two by six cavity. And then you can attach your ducting with your dryer on the other side most of these have got accessibility where the machine is. So it's very easy to do sometimes your dryer exhaust will actually connect to a pipe that's in your ceiling that's a little more difficult to do. But most cases they all have one thing in common nobody installed it using the screws okay see that most people shove this in. And then use the caulking. And then walk away. And that is really interesting because what happens is you can see this it becomes a way for moisture to get into your home what we want to do first is break up this caulking joint that's all around it. And i like to use my 5:1 tool for this. And gloves of course because when you're working up against the brick you don't want to get you can rubbed up against that stone. Now my guess is the way that this is in they might have actually put an expansion foam or something in there to hold this in place it's really putting up a good fight wow not an expansion foam actual mortar mix wow you know of all the dryer vents in the entire world i picked the hardest one to take apart usually kids they just pop right off it's not that tricky you can see here oh there's the flange all right you know those dryer goop i never seen an installation like this before in my life there's a lot of mortar mix. So somebody at some point a second pipe layer inside of this thing.

And regardless what you find the whole goal here is to clean out the hole. So whatever it takes to get that done we're. Now committed hang on i can see it there you go go to yank this is yank it yeah okay wow. Now that was ridiculous here we go okay. So this is the typical function. And when the wind blows the vents open up okay this should be curved. So that when the winds blowing this way it holds the shut. And all we have to do here. Now is pray that that fits the whole of that mortar joint i'm running into something in here yeah just gonna make this a lot simpler for us i just don't need all this mortar mortar doesn't do pest control because this whole thing has got a pest control on it mortar doesn't do anything for insulation all it does is get in the way at this point that should open up my access perfect okay. So now i've got lots of lots of ability to connect that. So in this situation because the wall is a two by six ball plus it's a brick the extension that came with the dryer vent wasn't long enough to reach the other side. So it's necessary to take another piece of 4-inch pipe with that perforated or that dimpled edge. And it fits inside it's like a pipe extension. And from the other side inside the house there's a few inches sticking out of the wall. And we can attach our pipe to that. Now in that direction that the dust will be traveling there's nothing there to catch. So it should exhaust pretty nicely. So here's the key to having a good-looking dry nice tight vent line that up take out your black marker i love these because it's a fine point marker thank you milwaukee big fan of the ink.

But it works on any function just take it off hammer here i'm on the edge of the brick always nice if i can get it a hole in the brick [music] not a good quality bit this is probably why the last guy just use adhesive to attach it to the building freakin amazing. So we're gonna copy we're gonna follow suit. But what i'm gonna do is i'm going to take off all the old stuff first. So that the new stuff has something to adhere to other than just old caulking. But listen you could use plastic wall anchors. And regular screws i know it's an exterior application. But when we're all done we're going to be sealing it up with this lovely white quad. And this adhesive sealant works amazing. And you don't have to worry about your screws resting because it would be impossible. So instead what we're gonna do is i'm gonna actually hold the fins open. And look through the hole.

But the end of the day this will work fine just remember there's nothing to hold it against the brick wall. So you want to cut it on an angle. And use the side of the tube to force the direction of this i didn't puncture the hole did i boy it's funny. But when you're getting eaten alive by bugs you kind of forget all the details there we go i'm using the side of that tube to force it into the hole the idea here is to try to set this up close the gap force it in the hole without pushing on this exhaust you do not want to run your finger in this stuff after you're done to smooth it out this is not a time to worry about looking pretty this stuff is incredibly sticky it sets up. So fast trying to smooth it out is just gonna make a bigger mess if you slow. And steady keep your tube in front of your ear cocking. And just run it down. And stay out of its way. And it should come out generally flat. And look really nice nobody that does any clapping on the extra house as a profession is all that worried about the the look they're more concerned about the seal. And then when you're done put it over that hole. And fill it up until you see it squeezing out that's that we're all done all this left is to pop on the bird screen. And it just sits on these two pins. So you can just grab this. And pop it up anytime you want which is how it gonna be necessary because it's dryer vent. And this is gonna get clogged up with that dryer exhaust to breathe. So it is a maintenance issue once you put this kind on.

And really don't know their trade my goodness we  managed to find something that has similar hole size. And by that i mean the distance between the screws that's like an identifying mark as far as what style of handle you have. But then this whole piece in the middle you can see in the door that's all morti out okay. And so the new hardware has to be able to fit inside that old mortising. Now you see here it's a little bit smaller. But i'm a little bit confident that we should be able to make this work generally recommend when people are doing anything with hardware that they read the instructions [music] thoroughly. And being a guy that was a lesson that took some time to learn. But here we go these are my instructions basically it says screw it together that'll be a lot of help all right oh my goodness i'm going to open this up kind of like a surgical theater here's our new handle assembly okay we actually have an old style this lock is mortise.

And see if our luck holds out [music] today [music] wow just checking to see if this lock mechanism is going to work from the inside appears to be working fine nice smooth motion lord knows if they send anything preassembled it means the box has to be a little bit [music] bigger simple as lining this up this is just a machine screw. So i usually go backwards a little bit. And it'll sit in the ring. So it won't cross thread there we go nice. And tight. And there's the other one 45 second video. So we've installed that lock mechanism in the. And there we go that's what we're looking at that's the final assembly. And i got to hold this here the whole time. Now i'm going to drop it i'll fall apart this i almost want to call my helper times like this i wish i got my engineering degree holy [music] cow okay that definitely grabbed all right it seems to still be working we tighten the other screw up. And these little pieces here were from the other door. And i'm thinking if we just take out the set screws. And slide these back in place this might just make it look a little bit better the new door doesn't come with anything like this [music] this is where you want to have three hands [music] [music] i think i like that. So this is the locking mechanism receives on the inside of the door jam we're going to compare these two they're similar heights. So the screws that were there before we work again same width same depth just a different interior bracket system. So we're definitely going to replace it with the new one. And try using these old holes. And see if that works all right here goes everything let's see if this will work nope. So classic lesson learned here this lock needs to be adjusted down a little bit. So we're going to drop this one here. So when you're installing this you want to just measure from the bottom of the plate up to this make sure it sits in the s ble of this if you don't have a measuring tape little trial. And a will do the [music] job okay max give it a try yeah yep oh that was actually really well really good smooth motion.

And today i just want to show you how to change the toilet fill valve. So we've got a typical replacement fill valve that you'll find at most hardware stores today where the float is all part of the valve itself rather than the old-school one with the big arm. And the big ball over here floating around. So so this is typically what you're gonna find in the newer toilets today. And this will typically replace just about any other type of valve as well. So even if you have the old-school one you could put this style in. Now that being said first off i just want to explain that if you've got a fairly newer toilet like we do here. And it's actually got an existing valve that is the same as this if you wanted to just picture this being in the toilet. So this is in the tank what you can do is if you reach down in the tank. And unclip this little sleeve right here the top end of this valve will just pull off. And this would be left in the tank you wouldn't have to drain tank raid out completely. And undo the bottom knot. And all that stuff. Then you could simply slide your new valve right down onto that existing stand get your height right. So let's below the top of the toilet bowl or toilet tank. And then whoops. And then click this back down in there a little less messy because you don't have to actually drain the water. And and everything. But we could do that here. But i want to in the video we're gonna actually show you how to remove the whole entire thing. And put the new one in. So but just. So you're aware that you could do that. And another thing with this type of valve that you might be able to do if you're having if this just isn't shutting off all the time you know the water level seems to be up where it is. And the floats up. But it's still constantly running a little bit there's a little gasket in the top here that may just need to be cleaned off. Now to clean that what you need to do is reach into the bowl pull the float all the way up. And just give this top a little twist about a quarter turn. And the top comes off you can't actually. Then unsnap it from this thing. So this would all still be down in the toilet udo up the water off before you did that. And what you'll find is you've got this rubber gasket in the top end here. And sometimes they get some calcium buildup or just some scale or whatever if you clean that off real well. And carefully. And put it back on here that might completely fix your problem. So just line it back up. And clip it back on. And you click this back on it's kind of hard to show you when this is not fixed in the toilet. But now it might fix your problem all on its own without actually having to replace one. But in our video we're gonna show how to replace this whole entire thing okay. So we're gonna get the camera repositioned it's kind of tight quarters. So hopefully you don't mind the video quality. And the sound quality. But we're gonna replace this one right here. So start out what you're going to do obviously take the back off your toilet tank you can see everything this is what we're changing right here you're gonna turn your water,https://youtu.be/edRgKyFRKZc?t=0,"['What type of fill valve does Shannon recommend for replacement?', 'How does the new fill valve differ from the old-school one?', 'Can the new fill valve be used with older toilets?', 'Why might a rubber gasket in the top of the fill valve need to be cleaned?', 'What is the purpose of removing and replacing the entire fill valve?']"

And i'll show you that once we get the camera all repositioned okay. So we've repositioned camera man's gonna freehand this. So just kind of bear with us it's not that easy to do. And take quarters. So what i was talking about was the water shut-off valve which you should find a valve sticking out of the wall below the toilet if you don't have a valve you'll have to turn your main water off okay. So close the valve flush the toilet [music] okay.

241.0,737.0,Toilets,PLh0KqGKtX4oVaKk4CGg2dpVf4S0ZFyldO,How To Replace A Toilet Fill Valve,edRgKyFRKZc,How To Replace A Toilet Fill Valve: get rid of most of the water in the tank,7761f564-7f02-d040-34bf-4e7005dca186,[music] okay. And that'll get rid of most of the water in the tank to start with you're gonna want some towels. And a bit of a container down here to try to catch as much as you want because once we've loosened everything off we're going to definitely have a bit of water coming out next step we've got the water off we flushed i'm going to undo this nut which connects the water line to the bottom of the fill valve. And there will be a little bit of water dribble out here i'm kind of doing this blind i can't see what i'm doing okay we just need to kind of get that out of the way okay. So then if you can see down here we've got the threaded portion here. And this is the nut that's holding everything tight holding it down i can maybe show you on here better. So here's our new one basically what you have is there's gonna be a rubber washer inside the tank sorry i should have that on there it's gonna be up there this will be stuck down through the tank. And this is that nut i was pointing out which will be tightened up to the bottom of the tank which will push up tight on that rubber. And make the seal. So we need to remove this nut. So that we can pull all this stuff out of there. So let's see if i can get a hold of it good enough without seeing it yeah i'm gonna have to use pliers i was hoping i could kind of do it with my fingers i'm gonna have to get my head in the way to just get it loosened up. And then. Then i should be able to show you what i'm doing again yeah i think i've got at least enough finger tight there fingers loose or whatever you want to say. So listen that'll come off. And i give this a little wiggle hopefully i catch most of that water. And i can't see if i'm catching most of it. But i think i am sounds like it's hitting that bowl that's why it's kind of important to drain as much as you can out of the if you've got a wet dry shot back you could also suck that out or throw a sponge in there. And suck up most of that we're just gonna get this all out of the way. So you can see. Now we've got a tank with a big hole in it that holds no water. But we're gonna fix that. So here's our new valve. Now since i've got the old one out i can kind of preset this to the height at least to what the existing one was. So you can see here. And see here let's see this would be the right there would be the comparison i need to lower the new one by basically the height of this here. So actually i don't need to move that collar i can just simply turn this. And that'll thread down. And again we're pretty darn close to the right height right there it should be okay there's a slight difference in the the style here you can see this part on the new one on the old one it's way up high. But just a little difference there we're just looking at the total height from where it would be in the tank this is off of here. So that should work i guess well we got it out just see if we're orientated the same i think i can turn this. And see this where this hole is is coming off right here on the old one is where this is. So i'm just trying to get things kind of set up the same. So we should be i'll be quite grainy there there that's better see how we've got the float orientated to this where the holes is gonna be. So it should fit back in the toilet tank basically the same as where it was. So can you just kind of do that with comparison wise with the old one well you got it all over the tank okay. So we already put this rubber seal on there make sure it's pushed up nice. And tight seems to be okay we're gonna drop this down in the hole. And i'm not pushing hard this is all plastic. So don't overdo it. And you can see from my hand. And the way i'll just get this nut started. So i'm getting that started on there i'm just gonna snuggle up finger paint there. And before i get it too tight i just want to look in in the bowl make sure that the float will move freely it isn't rubbing on the styrofoam or the chain or anything like that it's all in a good position we can see when we add our hose we're gonna be fine with our holes coming off that fitting. So i think we're alright. So now we'll go back underneath. And i'm just gonna get that little tighter sorry for my arm in the way. Now this one i notice they've got it really. So that you can't put a wrench on it i could probably make those pliers work. But i'm just gonna kind of finger tighten it up as tight as i can get it. And we're gonna give that a whirl we'll know right away if it's leaking or dripping or anything i'm also gonna wake the bottom of the bowl or the bottom of the tank because we did have that water coming out. So we are cooled by a drip of old moisture area. And think that we've got a leak. So try to dry off as best i can i'm gonna put my head under there. And have a look it should be alright i'm gonna re hook up this water line again i'm working blind. So i'm not sure if i'm seeing right i'm feeling it right i think i'm started i just want to be careful not to cross thread it. And again just nice. And tight with your hands okay. So we've got that. Now back up in the tank we've got our holes. Now you could have a couple different situations here in this case this hole simply fits on to the new valve. And down into this little hole that the manufacturers supplied into this tube that's great if you didn't have this little blue ring on there with a hole or some kind of place for it to go they send this clip along what this clip does basically the same thing it just slides onto that white tube that's in there. And the holes fits onto the top of it. So if we didn't have wonder if this doesn't come off. But if we didn't have anything to stick the holes in to keep it there i could just open up this clip. And slide that on there hook this end up it's just to make sure that that hose is spraying down into that tube. But we don't need that in this case another thing you don't want to shove this hose way down in there because it can siphon sometimes. And just keep running. So you just actually this one has a stop in it you can only push it in. So far. But some of them may not have a stop you just need it to be you know half an inch or. So down in there push that into the hose onto the valve i'm gonna make sure this little ring is pushed down here that one that slid it wasn't. So that's good thing i checked it. And everything seems to be fine our,https://youtu.be/edRgKyFRKZc?t=241,"['What type of container would you need to catch water when fixing a leaky toilet tank?', 'How do you remove the old nut from the bottom of the fill valve?', 'What is the purpose of the rubber washer inside the tank?', 'Can you explain how to orientate the new float correctly in the toilet tank?', 'Why is it important to drain as much water as possible before fixing a leaky toilet tank?']"

So that's good thing i checked it. And everything seems to be fine our floats good i'm going to turn the water on. And we'll see what happens you tell me if there's any leaks down there nothing dripping in the pan that's good it's good idea for the first few hours just to keep an eye on it make sure that you aren't getting a drift. And if you are you may have to put the pliers on there. And just give it a little bit more of a turn than you could with your physically with your hands i could have put this old nut back on there. And use the pliers. But i didn't okay. So are actually our water level is pretty darn good i don't know if you can see see if i can point here you can see the water level is right there you see i'm just touching it. So it's about 3/8 of an inch i'd say below here. And that's that's pretty good usually the toilets will have a mark or writing or something somewhere that'll say your water level line i don't actually see one on this toilet i'm kind of going by the old line it looks like it pretty much used to fill right up to the top edge. But as long as it's within probably a half inch to an inch of that top of that tube you're fine. And like said most of them will say if let's just flush it make sure that all works. And i'm going to adjust this float way out of whack. So the water level is too low. And i'll show you how you adjust that you can see the floats starting to come back up there. Now the waters catching it okay. So you can see. Now our water level is probably half an inch below that blue ring on this one it's down here. So if we want to if we need to bring that water level up that's what you adjust is this there'll be a lever of some kind on the float. And that will adjust how quick this arm rises. And turns the valve off when the arms down valves open when the float comes up high enough it's it's closed. So generally it'll say on here in your instructions which way to turn it i know for this one i've got a go clockwise to get a little more water in there they're giving another little turn. So we're pretty much to the bottom of that blue thing. And there-there were rate up to where we were originally okay give it another check down below for any leaks feel for any water on there it also feels ok. So i think we've successful successfully change that fill valve. And like said that that valve there will pretty much work in pretty well any toilet no matter what you're taking out of it. So and they're easy to adjust they should last quite a while. But periodically you do need to change them okay. So that's the end of that video. And hopefully you liked it. And you give us a little thumbs up down below. And share it on all your social media.

Now and again that it's refilling with water even when nobody's been using it chances are that your little flapper valve inside the tank is become out of shape or just worn out. And is leaking a little bit of water. So slowly over time the water level in your tank seeps out. And then eventually the float gets low enough on the fill valve. And it cuts in. And has to fill for a few seconds it's not a totally uncommon thing. And from time to time you may have to change your flapper valve. So all toilets when you feel when you take the open the tank up are going to have a flapper valve inside there's lots of different shapes sizes whatever. So you're gonna need to get the proper one for your tank. And most times by shutting off your water you got a shutoff down here for your toilet shut that off flush the tank. And it'll drain out most of the water in the tank. So that you're not up to your elbows in water. And then you should be able to pull your old flapper out. And we'll maybe bring the camera in closer. So you can see okay. So your,https://youtu.be/O7sN3AorUCI?t=0,"['What is a common issue with toilets that causes them to refill with water even when no one has used it?', 'Why does the float get low enough on the fill valve to trigger the flapper valve to cut in?', 'How often do you need to change a worn-out flapper valve?', 'What type of flapper valve is needed for a specific toilet tank?', 'How can you drain most of the water from the tank before replacing the flapper valve?']"

And we'll maybe bring the camera in closer. So you can see okay. So your flapper is this little gizmo right here. And it'll be attached to your flush lever. So when you pull the flush lever obviously this comes up it's generally designed to float for a split second. And then it's going to drop down once the most of the water has evacuated. And it's gonna allow the tank to fill up best way to figure out what flush valve you need is to actually get in here. And pull the smell off this cover off. And there's going to be some information right on it generally as far as who made it you know model that sort of thing. So the easiest thing to do is to take this with you when you're gonna buy your new flapper valve another option in this particular tank. And i haven't seen this very often. But raid on the bottom of the lid it actually lists some of the most common replacement parts that you're going to need for this particular toilet. And it gives you a part number. So you could order it ahead of time. And and have it when you're ready to change it. But i don't see that real often. So if you noticed when this was in there it just simply snaps on. And off let me just pop it back in okay. So there's a couple of studs on each side of this vertical pipe here. And on this one the flapper on each side just simply simply snaps on some of them like this one in this package they slip on. But this is rubber. So you can kind of flex those little arms up to the side. And slide it on to the these studs down there. So once you have it out you're gonna find that it's hooked to the to the arm here of the flush lever. So just simply unhook that. But take note of where it all was. And the length of the chain. And all that kind of stuff they're always going to be some kind of chain or connection point here okay. So that when you get the new one home you can set it up exactly like it was. And then it should function just like it was before except that it's gonna actually seal. So what it does is it just seals down here around around this when you when you flush your toilet it just opens up. And allows all the water rush down there into the bowl okay. So once you have your new one hook it on to the flush lever where the old one was make sure the chains the same length. And if it's got multiple positions make sure it's hooked in the same position just simply set it back in place attach it turn your water back on down below. And then cycle the toilet a couple times. And just make sure that it's good. But generally that's gonna fix you up it's not something that you're gonna have to do real often. But you know depending on your toilet. And water. And everything else you may have to do it a couple times in the life of the toilet okay so,https://youtu.be/O7sN3AorUCI?t=78,"['What is the purpose of the flapper valve?', 'How does the flush valve work?', 'What information can be found on the bottom of the lid?', 'How do I attach and detach the flapper valve?', 'What should I check before installing a new flapper valve?']"

So we're gonna help you navigate which one is best for you. So today we're gonna use a gel stain it's easy to apply doesn't make a lot of mess. So it's a great diy stain it also sets up in a couple of hours. So that you can start the finish go process pretty much right away. And with any luck. And good dry weather it could be a one day project alright. So here we are ready to do our door. Now it's a standard solid wood door it's an inch. And three eighths thick. So it can be used interior. And you can replace an existing door. But like i said we're using this in our shed. So make sure you check out that free shed video at the end of this doesn't be a link before you get started though you really want to make sure you've got everything you're gonna need i love these little blue towels. So this is the towel i use to apply my stain. And to wipe it off you're gonna need some sandpaper just to make sure your doors already some farce all because these are oil-based products okay we're didn't go over the water base on purpose because this is an exterior application if you're doing interior feel free to use the water base. But this is our gel stain. And of course our still will which is i was really fine this is a 4-0 steel bowl. And this is used after we're done or finished just to help get all the little bumps out. And just make a look perfect this shines like glass. So you're gonna get all this out of the way real quick because we have to prep this area. And we'll go through all the stages just. So that you can see how it's done. And then if you have any questions as you're watching this you can ask them in the comment section below. And of course i know it seems crazy in the world where everybody is trying to get money for doing nothing we still answer all your questions every day. So when you get your door right from the factory it's not ready to paint. And i know that might be really that's a bit of a surprise. But what it is is it's a pretty smooth surface. But if you just go. And feel it you're gonna find first it's dirty secondly there's gonna be areas of imperfection okay little areas like this in the corner okay. And if you see nicks. And scratches little dents just from the shipping process because it's all the wood just sand them up make sure your surface is as nice as you can get it. And as a rule of course always try to sand with the green just finish everything off. Now if you have any holes to be a great time to use a filler. But what i like to do is suggest that you take a look at your door before you take it back from the store if it's got that kind of damage just get a different one. So once your door is sanded you want to take a couple of these off some blue towels. And the reason i like these is because of the value when you go to the hardware store they're trying to sell you towels to do stain work ten dollars for three or four towels it's crazy waste of money for ten dollars i got six rolls of these things that'll last me a year in my shop no this is a little strong bar. So you can get just regular paint thinner the idea is just get a few drips on there here we go. And just give it a quick wipe okay. And what we're doing here is just removing dust this is not about wood conditioning this is a pine door generally speaking i only use wood conditioner on my hardwoods all right they need a little bit more help to receive a stain. And that's where i'll use them. But on pine i'm just using this to get rid of my dirt that's left on the surface once that's done we're ready to stain. So once we got our surface prepped up.

And i forgot when i got home that night i was going out for a fancy dinner. And i went out for a fancy dinner. And my hands were all stained oh my goodness i look like an idiot. Now i wear gloves cuz i don't try to pretend that i remember everything my wife's gonna get me to do here we go just take your paint tool this has to be opened up remember oil-based products don't get shaken they get stirred okay. So do not shake your oil learn the best things about gel stain is it hardly has to be stirred at all. Now you'll see real quick here with the gel stain there's not a lot of action going on there there's no color changing there's no nothing going on stirring this is almost a little bit redundant alright. So the reason i use this is. So i can throw it out just to demonstrate to you that there's not a whole lot going on there traditional liquid stains totally different if you don't stir it you don't even have a stain you're gonna have parts of the stain. But you're not gonna have a whole stain. Now the reason i love this as a diy honestly is because you don't have to be all that careful you don't need a paintbrush this is not leonardo da vinci time you just want to get this stuff on here i want to get it on liberally okay this is a rub on let's sit for 2 to 5 minutes. And then a wipe off go with the grain you only want to work with what you can comfortably reach because you wouldn't you don't want to be reaching across this wet stain table. And get covered on all your clothes. So i'm just gonna do up to the middle. And i'm gonna do panels as much as i think i can do in about 3 or 4 minutes. And then that'll be it. And then i'll stop them wipe it all off cuz it takes the same amount of time to wipe it on as it does to wipe it off. Now this stain is awesome we haven't seen a lot of gray stains on the market. But because everything in our design palette nowadays seems to be great having a gray stain is a really great option. Now of course very thin has two different grades on the market. Now so you can go lighter or darker this is actually their darker version. And i think i'm gonna run out of time. So i'm just going to finish a couple more cross here. And we'll do all the interiors later. Now you can see this does not take a great deal of skill this is just about getting things covered in goop. And that is really good enough. Now you can apply the stain in all kinds of directions if you have to fill gaps. But just finish wiping in the direction of the grain okay that's really the secret. And where you see the green change with the panels when you're all done just make sure that everything is in the right direction all right. So that has been two to five minutes. Now we're going to stop adding the stain. And we're going to take it off remember we don't want to let it sit for too long or we lose our ability to measure a consistent color all right. So we're just gently wiping what we've stained make sure we don't leave any big blobs on there okay if you do wipe the moon. Now we're doing this is your quality control all right this is we're doing it yourself is gonna pay dividends cuz nobody is gonna make it as nice as you will it's your house. And you are gonna know exactly what you care about. And you're gonna be able to take care of this to the whatever quality that you're gonna be happy with if you're not happy with something. And if it's too dark you can always put a little bit of everything on here. And wipe it a little bit off okay or if it's not dark enough once you've gone through this process you can always come back with more stain i'd say give it about a half an hour. And then try it again. But make sure the whole door is done first before you make that decision you might be surprised. And change your mind once you see the rest of the panel's changed over. So now we got another couple minutes we're gonna do all the inside on the one side of this door here. And then when i'm done i'll switch around. And i'll work the rest of the door from the other side okay. So we've got this side all finished the other four sides are all sealed as well which is very important because this is gonna be an exterior door all six sides of the door have got to be stained. And sealed. So that it's waterproof you don't want to let moisture creep in. And cause problems with your door. Now yeah for the sake of time i'm not gonna let that completely dry. And the reason i'm not is because this is after all a shed door. And that was the inside of the shed door. And i don't have four days to mess around with oil to do a code. And let it dry wait to the next day. So we are going to cheat. And get right onto the second coat right away. And i just wanted to mention make sure that the best side of the door is the one that's facing up it almost goes to those saying. But you'd be surprised some of the comments i get it's amazing you know there are people out there who want to do diy projects with little or no experience. And hats off to you i still think even if you're starting from that position you're still the best person for the job. So some of the information i'm handing out seems a little bit obvious. And redundant bear with me because we're trying to help a whole lot of people with a whole lot of different skill levels it's the same thing here guys we're just going to go along we're gonna put a nice generous coating of this on. And whatever i can stain in three minutes is what i'm gonna get done. And that is it. And we will come right back just like we did on the other side. And clean it all off. Now if you're wondering about using the acrylic products for interior doors very much the same the biggest difference in advantage i would say is that you can go with a really short drying time. Now there are some finish applications in the poly urethanes that you can use on a door in the oil that have got quick dry time as well i always found that the faster something dries the the shorter it stays performing well. And i guess that's is that proper english the more you cheat. So that you can make something move along quick the more it cos you both in the product that you're purchasing. And in the performance i think that's just a basic rule. So if you want to get something that's going to perform well especially for exterior get something that's going to take the whole 12 hours like a normal oil to dry don't be in a hurry to get something done just. So that you have to go ahead. And do it again in a few years later all right. So our doors completely stained all six sides. Now this is the biggest warning i've got for you be patient alright let the darn thing dry the number one cause of wrecking a stained project is moving along too fast this is,https://youtu.be/tGVZmn5M_3g?t=291,"['What are some benefits of using gel stain in DIY projects?', 'How does oil-based paint differ from gel stain?', 'Can you apply gel stain in any direction?', 'Why is it important to work with the grain when staining?', 'What is the biggest warning for DIY project success?']"

And after three four five six hours you can come out here. And it's going to feel dry. But what's going to inevitably happen is you're gonna grab that door flip it over. And you're gonna leave your fingerprints on it you're gonna wipe that stain right out of that door where you grabbed it. And then you're right back to the beginning of sanding it down. And standing again. And then adding another 12 hours of dried time to your project. So just let it go come back the next day put a finish coat on again let that one dry overnight. Then flip the door this is a three day project when you're dealing with oil necessary if you're putting it outside if it's an interior job you can do two coats of stain two coats of finish all in the same day. But if it's an exterior job don't even try to cut corners stick with the results that will last go with the 12-hour dry time product. And just be patient alright. So we're gonna let this dry well close the door we'll come back tomorrow. And finish this bad boy off well it is the next morning. Now and we are looking at a door that's been sitting here i guess it's about 18 hours. So we're kind of in the middle of the range for oil-based products from 12 to 24 this time of year was a little cool last night. But not too humid. So it's dry. But a little tacky remember this is a penetrating stain. So because it's a little taggy i'm just going to give quick rub. And just pick up anything from the surface here that's leftover there's gonna be a little bit of residue sitting on the top in areas where this theme was applied thicker just because we haven't waited quite as long as necessary for our current conditions. And that's fine that's not gonna hurt anything oh yeah not a big deal okay. Now to finish that i'm using here is vera thane diamond,https://youtu.be/tGVZmn5M_3g?t=738,"['What is the main cause of wrecking a stained project?', 'How many hours does it take for penetrating gel stain to dry?', 'Why did the author recommend waiting 12-24 hours before flipping the door?', 'Can oil-based products be used on exterior jobs?', 'What is the recommended approach for finishing an interior job with oil-based products?']"

Now to finish that i'm using here is vera thane diamond finish it's an oil based product as well it's good to match oil with oil. Now this is designed for exterior. So it's gonna have some uv protection. And of course you know i'm just gonna pull this out you can see the honey like sludge in the bottom. And this is why they say you need to stir this of course there is one rule of thumb you never shake an oil base you can shake acrylics. And latex. But you can't shake an oil you'll actually put. So many air bubbles in that product that will render it useless you won't be able to apply it it'll just dry with all these pits everywhere. And you have to sand it all back when you're finished. And so you stir until the honey like substance is gone. And you don't go vigorously here you can also whip the air into that stir too quickly. So you take your time. So one of these places where patience is a virtue there we go. Now that is perfect one of the things you don't want to have happen is you don't want to have drips on your door. So if i start working over here. And i get a drip it's gonna cause me a problem down the road okay. So that's why i'm working on a cloth. Now this is really interesting this is a throwaway brush okay it's just a cheap one i hate washing oil products. So what i do is i'll just take the brush like this. And i'll run. And fan a few times. And then lift it up if you see any hair sticking out you can get rid of them down. So that they're not going to sit in your finish while you're applying it okay. Then i'll help you out. Now generally the hairs are going to come out of the brush. So pay attention when it happens have your gloves on your hand. And just pull it out right away. Now oil is interesting you don't have to load the brush like you do with latex okay you want to just wipe off the excess we're going to demonstrate how to do this right here you want to just gentle. And you want to just stretch it careful to watch your drips. And you pull it across the surface okay without trying to squeeze it in. And the reason you do this is that you have control all right this is like sweeping a kitchen floor you're not sweeping like this okay what you'll end up doing is you'll end up rubbing the stain like i just did there in the demonstration that's just great yeah this is the back side of the door. So it's not an issue okay nice. And gentle. And that way you'll apply this finish to the surface. And you aren't going to change the overall appearance okay. Now in these grooves try to keep your brush under control. So you're doing just the groove again you don't want to manipulate the finish stain work you're gonna notice that when you don't leave it sit as long as you should it will pick excess stain up off the surface. And mix it in with the finish. And it'll kind of tint. So when you're done with this kind of a product it's a one. And done you don't want to save this for the next project cuz you're gonna have little bits of that gray rub stain sitting in the finished product in the can afterwards okay. Now i'm just being very systematic here in my approach working kind of clockwise. Now i'm using this product because i really like the vera thane products i've got a fair amount of experience with it over the years this is a product that's been around a long time something that my grandfather has actually been using. And turned me on to. But if you have an experience with a different finish oil-based or shellac or. And put it in the comments section below i'd love to get your take on this i like to see what other people are using give it a try on one of my products the next projects the next time always down for learning a new trick. And the reason this is a great diy project is because it doesn't really matter how perfect you are with this this is all about patience. And just keep running it until everything is covered first. So the process is really quite simple just make sure that you're watching your drips. So i like to you know when i'm filling my brush i don't just drop it in here. And squeeze. And pull right i'll drop a little bit there i throw it over there around the side. And then i'll spend some time. And pull it around the corners all right oil is amazing because it covers such a huge space with just a little bit if you're just a little bit patient you'll be able to take a little bit. And stretch a long way. So manage your drips pick them up as you go. And you'll have no problem with this the biggest difference between this. And latex paint. And latex finishes or acrylic finishes is its ability to cover a huge space with just a little bit don't underestimate it that looks dry well we'll just pull this a few times. And you'll see it'll take care of that whole space with plenty of left over. And when you're coming by these joints in the natural wood take your time to set your brush where the joint starts. And pull. And really establish that line you want to make sure that the grain of the way your brush is going is following all those wood joints that'll give you a really nice finish. And one little tip. So that you can do the side take your brush after you've dipped it paint an area until you think the brush is relatively dry. Then come back. And do the sides there'll be enough oil left in that brush to brush the side. And just keep stretching it until it stops working. And that way you can finish the side without drips perfect. Now real quick one more thing if you come here for information on how to do woodworking finishing inside your house one more coat or application you have is after this is all dry you can come by with your steel,https://youtu.be/tGVZmn5M_3g?t=861,"['What type of product is Vera Thane Diamond Finish?', 'Why is it important not to shake an oil-based product?', 'How does one remove hair from a brush used for oil-based products?', 'What is the key difference between using oil-based and latex paints?', 'Can you apply multiple coats of oil-based finish without additional preparation?']"

And natl make a lot more sense when you're in the store shopping for it's usually in the painting department can ask for help. But this is used in order to buff an oil-based finish. And what this does is it gives an oil-based finish a glass like look okay. Now the finish might be saddened or semi-gloss. But this will make an incredibly smooth also very easy to clean after that. So if one coat you're not happy with the the consistency of the finish you can always do a second application i would suggest sanding with the steel wool first wipe it down with a cloth a little bit of erath a non it. And then to another application. But when done always use your steel wool this is the more of a polisher than a sanding process. So you can polish your finish door with this.

And window casings. So let's get right into this we're going to talk about the product first you have basically two choices when you're going to be buying trim for your house. And that is the medium density fiber or you can get solid wood. Now medium density fiber used to have a benefit because it was cheaper. But now it seems to be running about the same kind of cost. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to suggest that if you're going to buy trim go get wood. And if you want a shopping secret don't buy it at the box store their markup is ridiculous go online. And find a local trim supplier in the area  you can just google trim carpentry supplier in ottawa we have a company that's just across the street i first found them because they opened up literally across the street from a home depot. And i saw the truck from malaysian alexandria moldings alexandria molding say i saw that truck roll into home depot one day. And i went shopping. And then after i saw it roll across the street to this other store i had no idea who they were. So i popped in to say hi turns out they sell their trim to anybody. And you didn't have to be part of their exclusive club it was also half the price right that's crazy. So i started buying really high quality three-quarter inch trim right that was cheaper than the economy trim at the home depot just saying  shouldn't be a big surprise for home depot to be handling trim it's real labor expensive i mean like they put it on this huge skid they have to roll this cart through. And they got guys standing there loading a few pieces of every kind of trim it's ridiculous when you go to this store they bring it the truck drops it. And they just roll it right into the bay it's more of a warehouse effect where home depot is more of a retail look i know they're supposed to act like a warehouse. But they don't operate like a warehouse. And it makes it very very expensive. So find yourself a good deal on your trim buy the highest quality you can find because one of the measures when people are looking at your house if you're going to sell is the trim work all right if you have the same cheap economy trim as everyone else it always looks flat. And boring. And it doesn't give you the options for making that pop on the wall when you use something like this as a baseboard. And it's three quarter inch thick that means the casings are also three quarter inch thick there's there's there's like a 3d look right it pops off the wall. And you get nice shadowing effect anyway worth the investment. So let's talk about what my program is. So there are different processes for installing. And finishing off your trim depending on what kind of situation you're in if you're in an existing space. And you want to change out old baseboards. And casings. And put new ones in. Then i'm going to suggest that you follow this process if you're in a new home construction environment where you're doing a brand new remodel. And you have access to a paint sprayer. Then i'm going to suggest you just install all the trim. And then tape off your windows. And use the paint sprayer to spray all your trim in place. Then you can cut. And roll all your walls. But what i'm doing is i'm going to follow a simple program for people who don't have those high quality tools okay because this is very helpful what we're going to do is actually paint all of our trim in advance. And then i'm going to show you how to install it. So that there's very minimal touch-up work after the fact because if you can paint all your trim first. And then put it in place you're going to save yourself a lot of crawling around. And bending over. And it just makes the whole process a lot easier to deal with. So if i paint it first i can put it in place do some caulking i'm gonna have a few nail holes to touch up. Then it's just really quick. And done nice. And easy. So i have got a nice baseboard it's a i think they call it the hopper series i don't know if it's available where you are. But it's very cool we also have some really thick casing. Now this is a three quarter inch profile as well. And it is really wide it's three. And three quarter inch. And i'm going to use this around my windows on a tile wall to give it a real dramatic flare also got some nice 1x5 flat stock this is very cool it comes a little bit of a rounded edge here. So this makes a really nice detail when you are running your casing up against it. And we're going to combine that for our window jams. And then we're going to add this as a window sill bam all right. So we're going to stick all that together to make our windows. And this will give us a nice little build out. And extend our window jam into more of a ledge. So that it functions you can put your herb pots. And stuff like that in the window in the kitchen. And then around our doors we're doing the same three-quarter. But it's only two. And a half same series. And this is because we don't want to have all of the doors of that huge trim it takes away from the effect of the window. And also makes it more convenient because we're gonna have light switches around the room. So door jambs on the interior that are too wide you really need to plan in advance to move your light switches over. And we didn't do that we went more of a standard install. So this is for that what we're going to do is i'm just going to pull out my roller. And i'm just using my mini roller today yeah i'm going to use the mini roller we're going to roll the trim set it aside to dry once you roll the trim it usually is about 20 to 30 minutes. And then it's ready to start cutting. And installing. So we're just going to take a few minutes. And get all this process done i'm going to wear some gloves there's not really a whole lot to this except because of the detail i'm going to roll it on a little thick. And then i'm going to drag my brush through it to make sure we don't have drips laying in all the edges that'll keep the detail sharp. And then that's it one of the downfalls of buying a gallon of trim paint is if it sits around for a few weeks it separates. And i don't have a personal paint shaker sitting around at home. So this is basically all i can do hey yeah yeah i just hate sitting there with a stir stick making a mess of everything there we go done okay [music] i'm gonna try to not get covered in paint today. And use a couple of gloves learn from experience that when you're painting the trim although you're only painting the top surface you always get a little drip line around the edge because the profile is. So sharp. And then when you pick it up to set it aside to dry it always gets all over your hands. And i am just  loving the idea of keeping my hands clean. So instead of painting one board at a time i'm just going to paint a whole section at a time [music] once this roller fills up with paint a little bit it'll work a lot nicer. Now i'm more concerned about these thick sections this joint here this is the part of the trim that actually sits up against the flooring that's the one that i don't want to ever have touch paint again all right. So that's the one that i want to put a nice thick coat on because i'm only ever planning on putting one coat of paint there the top part of the trim i'm not too concerned about how perfect that detail is because that's where i'm going to be putting in some nails. And that's also going to be where the caulking goes. And i'm going to need to run the brush again on that later to get a really nice cut line. So just making sure that that thick section of the trim is done gives me an advantage just run that through the detail. So we don't get drips. Now this is not as fast as spraying the trim once it's in place. But it's a lot faster than just putting it on the wall. And then crawling around brushing afterwards. And because we're getting a nice look right against that edge that goes on the floor i'm never going to have to run my brush right up along that edge. And try to cut it afterwards. And that will save me from having a lot of ugly mistakes later all right. So while our trim is drying we need a few more minutes before it's good we're going to just we set up the bench to show you all the tools. And stuff that we're going to be using in our carpentry video today. And possibly what you might need to be shopping for yourself. And we're going to go through how they all function. So that when we're doing the application later on the wall it makes a lot more sense for you okay. So first of all unless you literally want to install all your trim with a hammer. And nails which is an option you're going to need to buy one of these bad boys. Now this husky compressor it's a pretty basic unit it is i use it for trim carpentry you can also use it for hardwood flooring. But not for large spaces it doesn't hold enough pressure. And power to do a hardwood floor job start to finish without you constantly waiting for it to pressurize again. But for finished nailing it is brilliant it's on wheels. And the front has rubber feet. So this is designed to be used inside of finished house for doing repairs. And not going to mark any floors or cause any scratches that's an important consideration i'm using a two inch brad nail system i'm using an 18 gauge nailer for our trim  you could use a 16 gauge for some of this application because the wood is. So thick. But i found the versatility in 18 gauge if i'm gonna recommend to homeowners get one tool get one eighteen gauge nailer you can get nails that are one inch to two inches long different variations that's best for you a two inch nail works really good for a three quarter inch wood plus the thickness of your drywall that still leaves you enough nail to get through the drywall. And occasionally find some wood it's really effective when you're pinning things together. So i can connect my joints using these nails. And then i'm set to go you're also going to need some glue because all your outside corners. And miter joints should be glued it should be number one rule at doing finished carpentry glue your joints okay if you're not gluing your joints you're guaranteeing that those joints are going to crack. And crack joints always look like garbage. And means call backs. And more more work in the future. So avoid that. And use the glue depending on your compressor. And the tool that you buy you might need oil okay. And the way that that works is you can just put it in the back of the gun this particular gun that i have here from dewalt doesn't require oil. But let me just show you there's my gun there okay if this required oil it'll say. So in the package. And you just flip the nozzle up. And you can throw a couple of drips in there do that every 30 minutes to an hour to avoid your gun jamming on you. But like i said i paid a little extra for a gun that i don't need to do that for. Now that we're here we'll just talk about the gun. So this gun is awesome it has depth setting dial on it okay. So if the nails. And the gun are sticking out in whatever wood you're working with you can adjust that if you're going to a soft wood from a hardwood you can back it out. So that you're not driving the nail too deep it also has a nice little waist clip here. So it can sit on the belt. And any other considerations here oh yeah the little yellow rubber tip on the end there that's awesome because you have to compress the nailer in order to fire it right. And that little rubber tip down there keeps you from marking the wood when you're putting your pressure on other than that here let me get rid of that case the functionality is simple it has a release all right. And your nails can just be loaded in off the side knowing how to function that is really handy the compressor hose that ties all this together i always go out. And i buy one of these 25 foot rubber ones because they don't kink okay. And they always come back to normal you're going to find that if you buy a cheaper plastic hose it'll just be a mess. And you spend your whole day trying to undo the kinks in the hose you just pull down this click lock system okay you're good to go when you're all done you can just pull down. And release the tool. And of course if you're going to be using air tools i know. But this is one time it's important the brad nail is a very unique tool because it's firing a nail under an incredible amount of velocity. And sometimes when it hits an object or if you accidentally fire it'll deflect. And so it's good to have these on they don't do a lot of damage if you're not really close to it like i can stand here. And shoot max with the gun all day long. And he's going to get a few pin breaks. But that'll be about it. But it's good to wear the glasses this tool here i'm going to demonstrate later because we have an existing door that we pulled the trim off to start the renovation. And there are brad nails left in the jam. And so this is a great tool i use this to pinch my heads. And then i rock to pull the nails out you'll see that demonstrated later that's worth gold good to have drill construction screws  we're going to be building our own window sill because the depth is. So thick i couldn't just buy a stock window sill. So what we're going to do is we're going to glue the sill to the jamb. And then we're going to add construction screws. So always good to have that handy gives you lots of options. Now once we've got all the trim on the wall we have to patch our holes. And so hawk four inch knife. And you guessed it i love my sheetrock 45 this is a perfect application for this you can mix that pretty silky smooth. And then you can just use your thumb. And press it into all the holes because a good carpenter will always fill their own nail holes all right if you're on a job somewhere. And the carpenter installed all of his trim. And he didn't finish his nails he did not finish his job shout out to all the guys who are cutting corners out there if you're going to nail something on the wall. And you're not going to finish your hole you don't deserve to get paid go fill your holes it's not the painters job to clean up after your mess. Now you're going to get some hate for that one. But that's all right the other thing you're going to need is some caulking. So that you can do all your joints from your one surface to the wall. And even your inside joints nice to clean it up with a little bit of finished caulking this particular product is necessary okay this product is called windows. And doors okay don't use the general purpose caulking. Now here's the deal about caulking. And i'm going to get into this a little bit because the quality of your finish depends on the quality of the products you're using if you use the general purpose caulking yes it dries quick it's like 20 minutes. But it does not have any elastomeric property whatsoever. And during any expansion contraction cycle it's gonna crack all right. So don't use that junk use this yes it takes about two hours to actually set up properly before you paint. But it's worth the investment. And if you're doing any kind of trim work trust me you've got the time to let this dry put your stuff on the wall do the caulking first before you fill your nail holes. And by the time you're done filling your nail holes with your sheetrock 45 you'll be able to sand all your nail holes because it'll be dry really quick. And then by the time you're all done that this will be ready for you to paint okay. So don't get your knickers in a knot feel free to use a quality product even if it takes longer to dry. And if you're in a real big hurry you can buy a quick dry product that is elastomeric it's a little more expensive. And it's difficult to work with. But it's an option latex acrylic caulking you just snip the tip. And then you're good to go you don't have to puncture a hole. So don't waste your time. And you can make this really tiny. So when you're doing finishing work if the wood is nice. And tight to your wall you don't need a lot of bead okay because the expansion rate is like two to three hundred percent. So you can actually get away with a real thin bead it doesn't have to be obnoxious all right. So cut your hole small. And then when you're done you can put tape on it. And it'll be ready to use the next time because you're using 45-minute mud you're going to need a little sanding sponge. So you can take off your rough edges. And of course i know it's not part of finished carpentry as far as a trade is concerned. But since i'm talking to you the homeowner you guys are going to want to know how to finish the entire project here's my tips here have a little kills all right when you're going through your wood. And you're ready to paint it if you see any of that finger joint section of the of the primed wood that's a little yellow hit it with the oil-based primer first set it aside until it's dry before you paint it all right always good to have a couple of rags because if you're dirty. Then everything you touch is gonna get dirty  just good to have that going on get a nice three inch brush a stiff brush is best no that's not a joke a stiff brush for trim work is better than the regular purpose one used for a wall. But if you are good enough to get away with it one brush does everything it's generally recommended to use a stiff bristle brush for doing trim because most paint will when you paint it will drag on the trim. And leave lines. But if you're using a good quality acrylic paint okay. Then you want to paint from the top down always dragging in the direction of gravity. And you'll be fine if you're using oil start from the bottom. And paint up that's the simple rule. And that'll help you out because your trim paint is going to come in either a small court. And you can't get a brush in it or it's going to come in a gallon it's too much paint to work with having a handy pail. Now makes perfect sense because you can add just a little bit of paint. And you can put your brush on that magnet. And it'll keep it out of the paint. So it's not soaking up into the bristles while you're working okay the only other thing i think i wanted to mention was the option some nitrile gloves right when you're working with all your finished trim wear the gloves usually when you're in a finished trim if you're renovating your own house you could be in a finished space if you're going to get paint all over yourself get it on the gloves you can take the gloves off when you're done. And you're not going to make a mess somewhere by accident finally my laser level i know i'm going to mention this one more time we're going to be building window jams. Now our windows are in level. But in order to put the jams in we're going to build it all first. And then set it in place i like to just throw this up to have a laser line where i want it finished. So that i have a reference point. So when i'm nailing. And shimming it makes my life simple i don't have to constantly grabbing levels. And checking out all the surfaces for plum. And flush drop one laser line on the side of the window where the jam goes. And you can get that installed real easy you're going to see all of this in the video. Now let's get into installing this stuff because. Now the trim is dry we're good to go all right. So if you're a homeowner. And you're looking for tool investment understand that setting up your finished carpentry can be expensive. But it doesn't have to be the compressor nailer that i use you can usually get in a combination for around two hundred dollars this saw right here i think it also was about two to two fifty that's in canadian dollar. So i know you can get a better deal this is just a basic 10 inch compound miter saw it does not have a slide it's not a 12 inch blade everything i cut i've got to loosen up my wheel. And tilt over. And cut my miters on that angle the beautiful thing about this is it's set at 45 degrees as a default. So it makes my life simple when i want to cut shrimp. Now because my baseboards are. So tall i've got to lay them flat. And cut my miters on the side we'll show you how to do that in a minute the only other thing you need to know about this is it has a release mechanism underneath here. So that i can move my table. And i have my gauges for my angles here for today's video we are going to oversimplify everything. And only cut 45 degree angles that means when you add 245s together it makes 90 degrees. So that's all of your miter cuts around the doors it's also all of the inside. And outside corners on every wall if the walls are not perfect 90s as a homeowner doing finishing trim i'm going to show you secrets. And tips that you can use to keep your saw skills to a minimum. And then you do the install it's still going to look perfect okay. So bear with me let's get into this first thing we got to do is start measuring. So i've got my tape measure. And my pencil hmm pretty pretty pretty i'm going to be handing these out we're going to be going on our tour in just a few weeks. So make sure you check out our web page look at the event schedule all right check out to see when we're going to be in an area near you. And click on an event that you want to get to.

1313.0,2184.0,Doors,PL34cQkzKfXWZmwLKoU375GqFWuDzVVYhc,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z,dyDJjPWbRHU,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z: Finish Carpentry Doors,31e522f8-15f8-2027-f392-25b69a5edb48,All that information out we look forward to seeing you live in your city soon. So my process for doing finished trim in a room is first you want to do all your door casing. Then you want to do your baseboards. And then window casing the windows you can do in any order. But you can't put your baseboards in until your door casings are on that's kind of a given. So like i mentioned before this is an a previous door. And i'm i had a casing installed using the two inch nails that we're going to be using. And throw that over there. And these pliers are amazing because you can remove the nail without just pinching off the head modern amount of pressure just to hold it snug. And it'll release. And you can just roll it off. Now the design on this pair of pliers here for nail removal is that even up against soft wood lumber if you make a mistake you don't have your air pressure set right. And your nail doesn't drive all the way in you can sit this on your soft pine pull your nails with that rocking motion okay. And it's not going to dent the wood. So this is why i love having these in my toolbox they are a lifesaver whenever you make a mistake. And you will we all do that's normal all right there's a delicate balance there between cutting it. And pulling it let me tell you whoops balance not achieved okay. So i'm going to teach you my basic system for installing a door casing. And that is this set your window trim in behind the hinge. And you want to be consistent. And the idea here is you put your pencil there. And mark your trim all right you can see that okay there's your mark. And then on the face of this draw a line somewhat of a 45 degree to that intersection point. And make that real obvious that's all the information you need to go to the saudi cut. But in this situation we're dealing with new construction we don't have flooring yet. So you have two choices you can set it on the subfloor. And then later you can take out a jam saw. And cut the trims down or if you follow my advice. And you have everything on site because you've done your shopping already you bring out the underpad. And the flooring that you're going to be using. And you lay it in place. And you can set height of the finished floor in front of your door bam. Now you can put your casing right on that flooring what this will do is provide you the perfect gap for later when you go to install your floor you can slide it right underneath. Now when we're installing the floor in this room i'm actually starting on this door. And heading in that direction. So i don't have any concerns about doing this right. Now it's a great little cheat. But look how much my cut line has changed it's almost 3 8 of an inch difference okay that's awesome. And now i've also saved myself about 5 or 10 minutes per casing of fussing around with that little jam saw. Now the other side we're going to set that up as well there's my line i'm going to just trace that out on the trim put my mark boom. Now i'm going to go with the saw we're going to get those cut all right. So just a quick note if you have any questions or comments about the tool selection we're using make sure you put in the comments section i do check these comments every morning. And every night i may not have a chance to respond to all of them. But i will read them all. And if you are a member i guarantee to respond to your questions. So feel free to ask as many as you like. Now let's go take a look at this here's our trim. Now the saw of course we're just going to set 45 degrees. Now you see these notches right these notches are predetermined places where this the saw will set up. So there's one set at 45. And so you can be confident when you get there that it's the right angle. Now before you get started you want to get familiar with your saw you want to take a look at the material that you're cutting out where the blade is. So the blade is actually going to finish here about an eighth of an inch from the yellow side. So when i slide this over here i'm going to put my pencil line right on that mark. And then i'm going to cut twice measure once. And cut twice i know it's contrary to what most people do. But watch what i do here you see i just started my line. And now i know where that blade is going to go i can slide this into position [music] perfect every time. Now for the other side of the casing. And you know what just just for the heck of it if you find that it makes it easier for you. So you're not confused when you're making your mark put a whole line on that okay you can draw the whole relative angle just. So you know which way your saw blade needs to be set you don't ever get confused nothing worse than cutting something the wrong angle. And then it's garbage because it's too short. So we're gonna again we're gonna do a primary line. And you can do this over. And over. And over again as many times as necessary. And i use my thumb against the edge here. And i can actually feed the trim without moving my arm. So i'm never in any risk of cutting myself. And you can see there's my cut right on that pencil marker perfect i was just taking a couple shots max here [laughter] ah that's funny i was just reminding max of a story when i was working on a job we had a guy who did deliveries for us his name was bob. And every time bob would show up the guys would all turn around with our guns. And take the safety off we pulled the pull the trigger back. And then when bob would come up we'd all turn around. And unload brad nails on not the most responsible thing to do. But man was it ever fun  you'd see them we'd be 20 30 feet away. And the nails would all come firing up they all turned sideways. And they finished the rest of the trip sideways it was the weirdest thing every once in a while we'd poke a little hole in him. But he was wearing glasses anyway the next step in putting in your trim  don't put tight up against your hinges that's a mistake a lot of people make there's one stationary. And one moving element of the hinge. So if you're tight up against the hinge you're going to get squeaks take it a 16th of an inch off just make sure there's no contact there all right. And then about there throw that into the jam. Now it's installed come down to the next one. Now wood is tricky because sometimes it can be curved right. So you want to make sure you're on the hinge. And then let it off a little bit fire that nail into the jamb behind it remember the jam material itself is 5 8 of an inch thick okay. So it's thicker than this right the idea here is you're attaching this piece of wood to the door jamb not the wall or the wall framing at this point okay we get down here same thing push. And then pull it off a little bit. Now the reason i'm always setting this pin above the hinge is i don't want this nail to hit one of the screws that the hinge is using if it does that it won't go all the way in. And then you're gonna have an ugly spot there trying to repair next to a hinge. And you won't have access to it. So i always shoot just a little bit above three nails is all you need. Now you can check your gaps here my wall is sort of straight. But that's fine leave it alone for. Now because one side fixed. Now we come over here. And we're going to set this on our mark that we wanted for that right remember i put a pencil line there i'm going to shoot about a foot. And a half away. And i'm only throwing in two nails this time. And here's why when i'm cutting my top i'm going to be cutting the length from the two miters. And i want this to have a little flexibility to move left or right to close the gaps. And make it perfect okay. So if you set your nails a little bit lower you'll have a little bit of flexibility we're talking a 16th of an inch. But that little bit of flexibility makes the joint perfect. So now what we do is we're going to measure from the outside to the outside okay. And in this case it's 37. And a quarter that's perfect. So let's go back to the saw. And i'll show you how to set that piece take a scrap piece of your lumber material. And when you take a measurement write it down the number one waste of time on a job site when you're doing finished carpentry is not writing down your numbers i'll tell you why as soon as you do that you come over here oh you gotta adjust your saw the phone rings somebody calls somebody walks in the room asks you a question  you just generally get distracted with whatever you forget your number. Now you're right back to measuring again don't waste your time always write it down. And then i can keep that whole list going all day long no big deal 37. And a quarter is right here. Now on this tape it actually tells me if you're new to measuring you're going to want to get a tape that has these numbers. Now this is a dewalt tape measure 25 foot okay it actually tells you what inch. And what every different measurement is on the tape it's a bit of a cheat. But if you're new to this. And you're not sure. And you're communicating with other people knowing exactly what you're cutting is important. Now i'm going to make the mark a little bit bigger than 30 sorry 37. And a quarter wow one of those days already. And i'll show you why first we're going to cut the right length okay. Now i'm already longer than i need to be this is 37. And 3 8. And a bit. And here's why i would rather cut this a little bit too long all right. And then come back here. And take another blade another saw blade thickness off. Then try to make it perfect the first time. And get this miter here wrong because what we're going to do is we're going to cut both miters. Now same thing set your saw blade make your first cut check to see how far you are from the corner slide it over check it again make minor adjust here we go. Now obviously this is taking a minute to walk you through the process. But there is a perfect corner. And the way you check is you look at the end. And you see if there's any flat section. And this one has just a little bit. So we're going to take off another part of a blade. And the way i do that is i slide the trim into the blade lift the blade. And then i cut because when i went into the blade i pushed the blade a little bit. So when i lift it up it kind of reset. And it cut me just a hair the other side will cut the other way get locked on your 45 i can run my pencil off the edge. So i have this little black line showing. And then i'm going to just do this as a bit of a guide okay blade i already know this piece is going to be too long it's going to be 37. And 3 8. And it is because i cut it perfect. So i'm going to actually i'm just going to cut it down i'm going to cut it the right length just by setting the blade there sliding it over i'm going to cut a blade length off okay the point of measuring. And cutting along on purpose is it's always easier to take a little bit off when you're done in case you make a mistake while you're cutting. So now we're going to just put it in place. And double check to see how it looks right okay. So here we go that's the right spot i'm gonna just open this side up just a touch. So it's gonna be fine remember our goal here is glue the joints nail the joints. And then attach it to the wall to level everything off. And i'll show you that process. Now all right. So we're not needing a whole lot of this right boom just run a little bit of a bead there we go. Now okay i'm going to shoot a nail through the side of the first trim into the new trim. And that'll bond all that together. And i'm going to put on a slight angle towards the back. So the nail doesn't come out through the face okay same over here there we go i like that okay. Now i have a bit of a curve in this wall you'll see that if i nail that one tight into the stud behind it it'll be perfect. So i'm going to set the nail right in this groove not in the flat section all right worked out well. And over here yeah same thing okay. And then just a couple into the jam boom perfect. Now all we got to do is throw a couple at the bottom make sure everything's nice. And tight to the wall. So these are going into the jamb. And go. Now all we have left is the side of the trim. And if we can close that up that's great. Now behind the jam there's usually a small space. And then there's wood. But you don't want to nail through the face of the wood. So always find this detail throw your nails there okay that makes it a lot easier to patch up. And a lot harder to see after the fact we'll do that over here as well beautiful that's enough nails for. Now now we're going to go work on the baseboard all right. So we're going to be measuring,https://youtu.be/dyDJjPWbRHU?t=1313,"['What is the recommended order of installing door casing, baseboards, and window casing?', ""Why can't you put your baseboards in until your door casings are installed?"", 'How do you determine the correct angle for cutting trim with a saw?', 'What is the purpose of using a pencil line to mark the trim before cutting?', 'Why is it important to write down measurements on a job site?']"
2184.0,3737.0,Doors,PL34cQkzKfXWZmwLKoU375GqFWuDzVVYhc,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z,dyDJjPWbRHU,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z: Finish Carpentry Baseboard,e54b297e-8bf3-89ed-f1df-3719ac5e5182,Baseboard all right. So we're going to be measuring all of the baseboard i like to measure four or five 10 50 pieces at a time it doesn't really matter because this system allows you to measure. And cut everything first. And then assemble it. And then install it. But one thing about this wall is we're getting a tile. And so i have to consider the thickness of this tile. And the adhesive that goes behind it. So i'm going to take a half an inch off of this measurement. So that i can put the tile let's presume that that's my finished wood i can actually tile this wall. And slide the tile in behind the wood i know that this tape is a little bit old. But most tape measures come with a measurement on the back of the tape. And that's the measurement from the heel to the front all right. So when you're measuring you can actually measure a space this okay. So that's my measurement my measurement is actually six feet plus the three. And a quarter inches of the tape itself. So it's six foot three. And a quarter okay. So in inches that ends up being 72 plus three. And a quarter 75. And a quarter. But we're going to take off a half an inch. So my measurement is 74. And three quarters. And this is where this gets interesting i have a system that i developed that i'm going to let you use. And that's this since we're going to cut everything at 45 assuming the corners are 90s you have really only three marks here. So this is the length of the board. And that represents physically a board. And on this side it's a straight cut on this side it's a straight cut it could be an outside or an inside corner. And i just make all these marks. So i'm going to run around the room take all my measurements. And then mark this template here with whether it's an outside or an inside 45 cut that's all i need to know. Then i can go to the saw knock all those pieces off. And then i can glue it all together nail it all together. And then slide it in place. So i'll show you how this works. So here's how i do this take my measuring board. And we'll call it that for. Now and this first piece has a straight cut. And then an inside miter joint because the the line will be like this that's an inside line. So i mark inside joint the next piece on the left side is going to be an inside joint. And over here it's going to be an outside miter all right. And after that the next piece is going to be this. And then that. So now all i do is measure the three pieces nice. And simple again you can measure both directions you can just go like this read your tape. Now that says 20. And three quarters is tight 5 8 was actually going to be perfect because when you're measuring into a corner you want to go a little bit short on purpose it's easier to finish. And fix all this with the caulking after the fact. Then to try to force it all in place. And then you'll end up cracking your joint on your drywall. So we'll go 20. And 5 8. Okay. And this one we're going to take the actual measurement 35. And a half because i want a 35. And a half to be coming out of that corner just a little bit i'm fine if it comes a little bit past that corner again i'm going to install the trim first lay it in position. And then we can the gaps. So let's get that measurement one more time because i broke my own rule. And i never wrote it down 35. And a half. And then this wall we're going to cut 4. And 7 8 just a little bit more would make me feel better. So if you want to get really specific you can go 4 7 8. And you can actually put l for long. And you can cut in between four. And seven eighths. And five inch that's what i'm going to do let's go to the saw. So we'll start with the first cut is the simplest it's just a straight cut seventy four. And three quarters i'm going to measure that. And put a mark right there okay. Now we also have a short one. And whenever i have a shortened with inside note side corners that i'm going to be doing on the flat i like to cut them first because that way i can hold my wood in place far away from where the saw is going to be. So 20. And 5 8 wow that is not gonna be big enough four. And seven eighths yep. So i've got one that's four. And seven eighths here long right. Now if you were to look at this remember that's the end of the wall. So this board is actually going to be like that. And like that something along that line right. So what we want to do is we want to put this side on first it doesn't have to be perfect we'll set this up make sure your trim is against your fence that holds it square to the blade start the blade. And once the machine is running. Then you can make your cut [music] all right. Now if you want to have nice looking trim. And you want to be safe use a really sharp blade the duller the blade the more likely you are to have an accent. Now we can take our measurement to four. And seven eighths long right here we'd call that 15 16. But it doesn't actually get written on the tape that's why i came up with that other way of saying it all right. Now here's the thing the saw blade only rests on one side. So when you want to cut the other angle going that way you actually have to move the trim around [applause] extend that arm the reason i made the mark about an inch. And a half off the edge here because on the thick piece of wood that's where the blade makes contact first all right. So i can actually hold this board in place line that up. And like i mentioned before we'll do a quick cut line to confirm. And then we can make an adjustment if we need to [applause] yeah i'm just not quite long enough there we go. Now that little bit of a nick there is not going to be an issue we can take care of that during our touch-up phase. But that is how we set up that outside double outside corner. Now that's my first measurement for my other cut okay perfect take our notes scratch off those cuts are done next piece. So now i'm going to do the 20. And 5 8 okay. Now my material is upside down. So how you visualize this this side will be square. And this side will have that inside corner first thing we have to do is square this off don't ever think or assume that because it comes from the supplier or the store even if it looks nice that it's square a lot of times they're running this board fast through the machines. And it gets cut even on a one degree angle it'll wreck your day. So always hold things nice to the fence. And clean up your own edge [music] [applause] all right. Now we can measure from that 20. And oh hang on that's an inside corner whoops i got my own self spun around here when you're measuring an inside corner you measure the whole width of the board 20. And 5 8 right what we're going to do is we're going to cut that off first we'll put that measurement where the saw blade will make contact there we go all right [applause] okay. So now the board is the right length. But we want to cut this up. So we got two choices i can guess i can tilt my saw i can come over here. And i can throw a cut line on it. And throw a cut line on it throw a cut line on it. And go crazy or we can cheat. And come at it from over here because i can set the blade off the back of that wood right there that's my spot. And i can see that. Now you'll notice i'm not going to get all the way through because it makes contact yeah makes contact on both sides here's a little trick since we're holding the material up against the fence it holds it square i can cut. And trim off the back side [applause] [music] perfect every time. So now we got 35. And a half that's our last piece. So let's get this up let's visualize 35. And a half. So we're going to be coming out of the corner on on the 45 that way 35. And a half over here we're also going to be cutting that way seems awful tricky right well what you can do here's another trick you can add the thickness of the material which is three quarters you can add that to this measurement all right which ends up making it 36. And a quarter. And here's why if we cut this at 36. And a quarter this is actually where the outside of that cut finishes off. And this gives us flexibility okay that's also a cut all right you see where i'm going with this. Now i can lay my saw flat turn this around. And i can cut that from here. And i can line that up right to where my blade is touching the edge. And finish my cut. And then i'm going to switch sides again. And remember i'm cutting this angle. So i'm going to be cutting from here. So what i can do is i can measure over three quarters of an inch remember when you're cutting on a 45 degree angle the dimension on this side of the line. And this side of the line are exactly the same. So that's just a little bit old grade 5 math that you can employ. So you can make a mark here three quarters of an inch. And your saw blade will make that contact first. So what we do is set this back okay we're going to hold that in place. Now what i got to do is i got to cheat because i got to be able to look underneath all right get this out of my way [applause] i am loving that. And that is how you can make all these cuts in a variety of different ways the secret is measure it once. And cut it twice or three times four times or whatever it takes. But you can work back towards your lines. So now i've got my inside corner. So the outside corner is four. And seven eighths long all right which basically means 15 16. But what we're going to do is we're going to call it five short it's easier much easier math. And the way you want to do this on this saw is you add the thickness of the wood times two. So three quarters gives you one. And a half. So we're actually going to cut six. And a half short. But we're going to try to do six. And a half first because it's easy to shame off a little bit. But that gives us a little flexibility. So here we go right because we're doing outside corners let's start with the easy one we'll go over here. And we'll just cut an edge [applause] okay. Now we can measure back six. And a half was it if you're ever not sure there we go that's why we always write things down it makes life. So much easier this this cup would come from this side right. So what we're to do we're going to have to run a few times here because the measurement is based on the thick part of the dimension. So i'm going to have to start a couple of sock cuts here. And cut right through until i see where it comes in contact with that pencil. And then we'll commit okay. Now it only takes a couple seconds to do that. But then you get a perfect measurement there we go all right. So before you assemble all these pieces just do a quick check make sure that it's all going to fit right that's a little bit tight down here on the bottom. So i'm going to take i'm just going to mark this cut that one a little shy okay that's a little bit too far off the edge. So the easiest cut for me to make is on this side. So i'm going to scribe here. And you know what this is the time to do it if you run a bunch of measurements go to the saw. And cut them. And then come. And double check. And if things need a little bit of modification that's fine because we're intentionally marking just a little bit long. So that we if we have problems with the saw or the cutting we can make those adjustments without throwing wood in the garbage this one is also just a little bit long. But not really i'm going to leave that one alone one more trick just to before we assemble is if you're working on a whole room always start with your long walls if you do all your long walls first. And you make a mistake on the trim you can use that piece of wood to cut smaller pieces out in the room if you start with the small intricate ones like i am. And you make mistakes all you're doing is throwing out wood that has no other value. So remember start big work to small. And then when you get to these corners cut everything first double check the fit. And then when you get the perfect fitting. Then we're going to assemble. And install boom boom boom this is where it gets interesting because in this old house this part of the floor actually caves down a little bit. So you don't want to follow the contour. Now this is old home trimming techniques if you're in a new place. And everything's flat. And level great good for you you can just nail it in as you go. But what i want to do is actually connect all these pieces with glue. And nails first. And then when i put it in i'm going to put it tight on the corners. And the bottom in the back here is going to raise up. And it's going to follow a level line. So i can have nice joints. And that is going to be the key to my success here we're just going to slide that glue around a little bit make a joint we're going to nail through the side into that other three quarter inch thick wood one up here beautiful okay softwood lumber is really predictable we're also going to do this corner same thing okay slide the glue around a little bit it's basically the same thing holding everything nice. And tight fingers out of the way. And visually this bar you know what straight the nail's going in straight line it up. So you know it's not going to stick out just in case. Now we've got all three pieces together. Now watch what happens i put it in the corner okay. So you'll see the trim over here there's a big gap at the bottom even when it's tight at the top. And that's because that whole piece of trim over my elbow elbow side is down. And it's causing that to open up see how that works. So this is how i know that the floor is caving away. So if i lift the other side. And close that gap. And then nail it. Then it's going to be nice. And tight because the biggest enemy you have to installing your trim is  contact later on if the trim isn't nice. And snug to the wall you're gonna vacuum or sweep or the kids are playing around with the ball things are gonna get broken. And chipped. And knocked out of position. So make sure there we go when you nail it everything stays nice. And tight try your best to install your nails into the framing behind it. And if you can put it in the contour the detail will work. Now this particular wall is actually full of heat runs. So there's nothing to attach this to other than the drywall. So i know that if i want to take a risk of puncturing that the grill right making all that noise we're going to leave that alone over here i'm going to bring that wood right down to where the casing is here we go that's installed. Now i know there's gonna be a lot of people saying oh why didn't you leave the gap all the way around for the flooring it's because the gap is going to be inconsistent. So even if i raise it high enough for the flooring to go underneath i'm going to have the same problem of a huge gap in some places. And not in others. And so the way we handle that is with a small little piece of trim. Now there are a ton of different shoe modes on the market this one is designed to be added after the flooring goes in it is a half an inch deep. So there's plenty of room for expansion contraction gaps no matter what kind of flooring you're using. So i'm going to do the flooring first you have this pre-painted. And i'm just going to add some no-nails adhesive on the back i'll stick it in place. And tell me how sexy that looks it's not quarter-round it's not ugly. So if you go to these specialty stores you can get quarter round or shoe mold trims like this that match the design profile. And it looks amazing when it's all finished that gives you all the flexibility you need in older homes to be able to finish after the flooring. And it's a quick little step to run around the room. So once all your trim is installed. Then we pull out the caulking gun because we want to finish our job nice. And we just want to get a little bit of a cut on an angle you can see there is not a lot of room for that caulking to come out that is perfect i like it like that because i don't want to use too much. Then i don't have to wipe it all the way. And you'll see that bead that i'm throwing there it's a perfect gap between the trim. And the wall okay whenever you think you've got too much excess you can just rub it in further down the line here sometimes these gaps are a little tricky to work with it's kind of like drywall work right always there we go finish the other direction from the corner. So you don't have any of those ridges all right we're going to go around we're going to caulk all of the gaps [music] sweet remember resist the temptation to use this caulking to fill the little holes because this will shrink a little bit when it dries. And then when the light hits it the right way everybody's going to see the little dents it's going to look like junk. So now our inside. And outside miters are glued. And nailed we still finish off with the tiniest bead of the caulking okay making sure not to leave any extra on the wood. So that when you go to paint you aren't going to have nasty little ridges. Now this is why i mentioned when you do everything with a 45 degree angle it's not always perfect. But you can finish perfect okay just run this finger up like this the direction you're heading don't forget to around the doors to the wall. And in your miter joints on the face these things are all nailed. And glued together. But don't want to rely on the paint to fill all those gaps. And cracks in okay as well always do that gap of the door casing to the door jamb that'll soften up that edge. And get rid of that shadow. And then it'll paint. Then perfectly if you don't use enough the first time. And you see a crack go back. And fix it don't ever leave a job that you're not happy with there we go nice once you've done all your caulking it's time to fill your nail holes. So that the caulking has time to set. Now this is a two hour dryer like i mentioned. So put this away. And let's get on to the other putty okay. So this is when you're gonna want your four inch knife. And we don't have to make a lot of putty. So just make a little bit of a circle here hopefully get enough material here that will hold a little bit of water. Now this is a 45 minute compound. So it does take a few minutes to set up. And when mixed with cold water it gives you a little bit longer working time. So what happens is the water starts to work its way through the mud. And slowly will penetrate you can speed the process up just by sprinkling it from the outside edges okay this takes a little bit of practice. So if you're new to this. And you try to do this i would suggest doing it in a place where if your volcano collapsed. And it ran off all four corners at the same time it's not going to be in a place. But you're going to make a mess you're going to regret. Now i'm a little shy on powder here it feels like all right here we go that's just too loose we are trying to make this more of a putty it's kind of like almost like baking class here you know just keep on putting a little bit more of that on there there we go okay. Now we don't want it lumpy nice. And smooth. So you want to work it up a little bit using the side of the knife okay. Now we're good. Now there's two holes you have to fill remember we have the holes on the flat section. And we have the holes on the detail okay. So i'm going to just wipe a little bit on my finger. And i'm going to just press that into the hole okay a little goes a long way. So the more you put on your finger the more you're going to be wiping off when after you're done filling the hole. And for those other details on those flat sections don't trust your finger because your fingers are round. Then it'll pull some of the material up just use your four inch knife done that's easy. Now this stuff doesn't shrink when it dries. So after it's dry you can take your sanding sponge give it a quick run you're ready for paint. So one of the last elements of course is the trim work we're going to just discuss that real quick. Now here i've got quarter round going underneath the door to close the gap. Then i'm going to just bring a little bit of a detail to it beautiful just firing probably three nails will be lots that's done okay nice. So you'll notice that this kind of trim although the floor is wonky because it's. So thin you can manipulate it to follow any contour that is beautiful,https://youtu.be/dyDJjPWbRHU?t=2184,"['What is the recommended method for measuring and cutting baseboard trim?', 'How does the author account for tile thickness when measuring baseboard trim?', 'Can you explain the importance of using a sharp blade when installing trim?', 'What is the purpose of adding extra material to measurements when working with 45-degree angles?', 'How does the author ensure that their trim fits properly on uneven floors?']"

So today i'm going to show you my system for trimming out a window. And now we're not just getting in the jams. And the trim we're actually going to use this bull nose in here. And make a nice sill. So that you can use this as a decorative shelf maybe some herb plants. And that sort of thing it's in the kitchen it's nice to dress it up a little bit. And whenever i'm doing a tile job with a window trim i like to get the tile done first. So that it has room for its expansion. And contraction behind all my trims very key. And then i can build over top of it all. And get a nice clean finished look without having cut tile all up. And down the side of my window trims telling you right. Now if you do it this way your windows are going to look spectacular they're going to have a huge pop let's just jump into this. And we'll get the process started. So first of all i'm in an old house right this is my 1880 farmhouse kitchen that we're renovating. And if you haven't been following along. Then i suggest just click the link up here. And you can start from the very beginning. But for everybody else who just wants to learn how to trim out a window what we're looking at is using this regular 1x5 softwood lumber stock okay it's tongue. And groove. And what we're doing is we're going to create a box this is called the jam extension we're going to do the whole gem extension first. And then we're going to insulate it. And then trim it. And here's why in an old house like this  it's foaming in the window you want to be a little bit conservative with your foam. So that you're not over foaming. And causing it all the stick. But in the jam area here is where we have the ability after the fact to really get another layer of expansion foam in there as a protection against drafts. So we're going to take full advantage of that. But first we have to cut. And measure all of our jam extensions to the exact depth from the window out to the face of the tile. So let's get started. So i'm going to use the back of this i've already cut my first sill it's wider than i need to it it makes my life simple. Now i've got a writing surface okay. So i'm going to put bottom left top left  top right. And then bottom right these are going to be my numbers. So that i can measure trace my lines. And cut all on the saw at the same time. So what i'm going to do is just take out my tape measure. So i'm going to just lay my wood across the tile to create my my depth. And i'm going to measure this off. And it says four inches okay. So that's the bottom right. And then we're just going to do this all the way around the window get all my numbers four. And a quarter all right [applause]. So now i've got my measurements i'm going to first cut all of my lengths. And then i'm going to go take it out to the saw. So i already have my bottom if you can imagine this okay. And because of the kind of sil trim that i'm going to use i'm going to be bringing this up to about this spot on the window about an eighth of an inch below this trim. And i'm going to maintain that all the way around the window when i purchased these windows i had the option to have a track installed it's part of the pvc mold. And it would receive the wood. But i find that to be very very frustrating. And you have to install one piece at a time there's a lot of other fussing around i prefer to just go right up against the vinyl window. And leave myself a little bit of an expansion gap. And cover that gap with a finished white pure silicone that way i don't have to worry about painting it i don't get graying over time. And i don't have problems with expansion contraction. So i'm going to leave 1 8 of an inch all the way around the outside of this window okay. So that's how i'm going to measure. So i'm going to measure from the inside down to that trim 36. And an eighth. And i'm going to add an eighth of an inch for the top that takes me that's actually a quarter 36. And a quarter 36. And 3 8. I'm going to put a little bit more on there i'm going to go 36. And a half. So i need two at 36. And a half. And then i'm gonna need one more across the top i think for simplicity we'll just go long yeah we'll go 33. And a half just like we did here okay all right. So now i'm going to go to the saw i'm going to cut my other jams i'm going to trace out my lines. And run that through the table saw. And then we'll whip it all back together. So here's my top sill. And we are going to be running everything on the table saw. So that the lead edge okay is not getting cut we're going to cut the back side. And that's because we're going to add the silicone. And it's going to be a surface kind of a cove bead. So it'll cover any of the inconsistencies on the table saw because i'm not cutting straight i'm cutting on an angle. And it'll also give me a nice straight edge when i'm putting on my casing. So that all looks perfect. So you got to imagine this upside down. And installed all right the left side i have my measurement four. And a quarter. And i'm going to measure from my front edge. And you can just put an arrow on it if it helps four. And a. And quarter this side it is four inches all right that's one that's the top obviously this will be the left side there's my lead edge okay right. So here's the front this is the bottom it's four. And a quarter all the way across. So i don't have to mark that. And trace it i'll just set the guide on my saw for four. And a quarter for that one makes it simple the other side is four we'll set the guide for that one. And this one is the bottom [applause] we'll call that my lead edge okay the right side is four. And a quarter sorry the left side is four. And a quarter the right side is four there we go okay. So i've got all the information i need on these boards. Now i'm going to go over the saw once. And make all my cuts. And remember when you're working with this don't be afraid if you take a little bit too much off if you're an extra 16th or something it's not going to be an issue it's or if you're even a little bit too long you're going to be okay once you put this on no surface is perfectly flat especially in an old farmhouse there's going to be areas there where you're going to be using the silicone afterwards behind the wood especially with detailed tile. So we're not being concerned about being perfect here we're just making sure that we're going to be close enough. So that when we do all of our silicone work. Then it looks perfect all right that's the secret don't be difficult. And hard on yourself right. Now because everything here is expanding. And contracting. So you want to make sure you have a little bit of room everywhere for that to happen if you make things too precise you're going to find out that everything's when it moves it's going to cause you issues. So let's get to the saw [music]. So [music]. So the piece that goes here i actually ran through the saw really quickly took off just a hair because it has a rounded edge naturally from the factory. And because i'm laminating the sill on there i didn't want to have that i need it nice. And flat. So this is going to go here. And what i'm going to do is i'm going to lift this up just to mark where my wood is going to make contact. So an eighth of an inch past there eighth of an inch past there okay i'm going to translate that information to the other piece which i cut the same length this way will help to ensure that my window stays square all right. Now i'm going to nail all of this together in advance of using any of this right nice. And simple. Now i'm not dealing with a ton of extra space here. So i think we'll set it up like this oh yeah lovely one thing to remember i always use glue on your finished carpentry you have to glue your joints or you're not doing finished carpentry you're just sticking wood together. And it's all going to come apart again all right. Now i'm using an 18 gauge 18 gauge finish nailer it's just going to pop in two or three i got two inches in here right. Now which is probably a little overkill however a little bit of know-how. And self-control we're gonna be all right okay. So remember i want to line this up on my pencil mark. And flush on the front. And not be too concerned. And don't leave your finger in the way just in the odd case that the nail comes back out that is pain you don't ever want to experience. So the goal here when you're working on site instead of in the shop you got to be a little more creative generally speaking we want to get that on that nail mark the pencil mark sorry. And then we'll get glue on this end. And then there we go this area here is all like up against the window if it doesn't make contact it's not as big an issue as whether or not the front is flush. And let's see if we know what we're doing hey yeah it's going to work all right whoo. Now let's just double check this. And you can see it is a little bit thicker than what i need. But my wall is. So inconsistent i'd rather be a little bit thicker i'm loving that. So what i'm going to do. Now is i'm going to use shims to put all this in place. But my the best kind of shim in this situation because i have a lot of room that i have to cover is a couple of spare blocks of this i'll be right back. So for anyone who's inquisitive. And wants to know why there's two different kinds of foams on this window because i was out of spray foam when we went to go. And install this window the first time we did that in a video put that link in the description up in the card here i use the phone from my local hardware store. And it expanded. So much that i couldn't open the window unbelievable i don't usually use that brand. And that's probably why. So i had to go back out to the store get my other brand. And then cut out all that foam. And reinstall the window unbelievable anyway lesson learned eh once you've got something you know that you like stick with it. So i'm gonna put these blocks down done. Now i can shim the difference that'll be a lot more convenient okay. Now the nature of shims is that they're wedges. And if you reverse them put them together for the same thickness which helps a lot. So i'm going to go start with two on each side just to get this closer to where we want to be okay like i said in an 1880s farmhouse nothing is level except for what you put in. So you're forever making minor adjustments eh i'm liking that side not liking this side yet a little bit here okay once you're happy with the height you want to just check here. And here make sure that the gap is the same on both of those okay don't worry about the top anymore once you get the height where you want it we're just going to drive through the shim. Now generally if we because we use a laser level when we install our windows that should be perfect it is once you have this installed level this 1 8 gap should be consistent all the way to the top. And then you can just double check with your square i mean that's just money in the bank isn't it taking the time to make things off of a laser when you're building makes everything simpler. So now i don't even have to think about it i can just push a little bit of resistance going the opposite direction with my 501 here set my depth two inch. Now good done. Now that's why i said that we're going to use expansion foam later because the nature of how this house is built i don't have really good framing. So by throwing that expansion foam in that's going to bond everything together really nicely i'm just going to finish with a couple of nails here getting pressure to the window okay nice there we go step one is complete. Now like i said we want to also guard against drafts remember that there's two panes this is a double hung. So i have a thermal layer here. And a thermal layer here there are different layers if you fill the entire cavity with expansion foam. So that you can take care of both of these thermal layers at the very beginning you're going to run into trouble. So generally we don't get that extensive expansive with it see my nails are just making contact i'm not going to overshoot this with foam. But i am going to put in a little bit here. So that i have a good bond okay here we go just across the front all right i'm not going to overfill that's basically the structure for my window. Now all right. And a little bit down here make sure i got a good thermal break there we go nice of course across the top here we are if you're shooting at the side instead of at the back. Then you'll get the foam to fill in front. And has room to grow into the back if i just point straight in i'm going to fill it. So full this will all end up bowing out [applause] all right there we go close the gun love the foam gun ah just a quick note when you're done close the handle always set it upside down. So that the gas isn't constantly leaking out all right it'll also keep it from falling over it's beautiful that's it. Now we have a window jam. Now it's time for the fun part okay. Now it's time for the sill. Now this is going to get contact right there all right that is going to be a lot of fun the way that we take care of this. And measuring this out is you want to kind of find that middle of the windowish okay. And you could always take a pencil. And and mark a center line. And there you go. Now when you're working you have something to reference from if it falls apart on you what i'm looking to do is set my window casing about there i have a full rounded corner. And i have a casing starting. And i want to make sure that when i put that casing there i've got room to add my painters caulking. And then i can paint that all together. So now my trim is going to go from about this point moving out i want my silk to extend just a little bit past the full width of the trim. Now let me show you this i got this earlier that'll be the trim. Now on that pencil mark there which is about a full eighth maybe three sixteenths okay. Now i have the width of my trim i can make that mark you can see that you don't want this extending way past there. But perhaps an inch up to where that tile is would look really good. Then i have a thinner version of the same trim series that's going to go underneath all right. And you want that to go you want that to finish up at the same point here as underneath. So we're going to extend this a little bit. So there's my mark here we go put this down before i get whacked in the head. So from my center mark my trim was 19. And 3 8. Okay. So i'm going to add an inch to that 20. And 3 8. I'll go this way. And i'll rather cut this thing on both ends. And know that i've got it the same dimension okay that's where we're going to cut it that's our length right. But the outside corner of this is actually right here right. But what we want to do is we want to cut that on a 45 degree angle isn't that interesting. So by using this square you can line it up create a cut line for your saw right there okay that's going to be my cut line. And then i'm also going to cut another piece. So that this detail is cut opposite like from this angle here i'll cut this first we've got to square off the end don't ever work with trim from the factory always cut your end first before you measure okay they never come straight i'm going to cut that i'm going to cut this what this is going to give me is this piece to fit around. So that this detail will go back to the wall i'm going to do that on both sides i just thought i would draw that out for you when i come back from the saw i'll put fit this all together glue it. And nail it first. And then we can install it. Now you might notice i don't know if it shows up on camera very well. But i've already pre-painted all this trim the first coat i just like it because it seems to save me a whole lot of effort. And energy from bending over the counters. And painting everything i don't mind doing one coat when i'm done. But i don't want to have to do the primer. And everything else it's nice to get all that done first. Now i'm just taking a sanding block getting rid of any of these loose hairs okay at the right end match it up put on a little bit of glue because we're gluing everything as we go here okay which is why i have my counter covered in a garbage bag exactly where i want it i'm going to fire in okay there we are. Now the nail is really just designed to hold that in place until the glue dries all right. So we're going to do both both ends here okay you can see they're starting to come together right. Now you can see this coming together okay. So next because it's a sill you can might be putting things on here that are like one or two pounds maybe five pounds you want to actually attach this. So it doesn't actually break off the secret to that is this construction screws okay not only do we want to make sure that doesn't fall off. But we want to make sure that that is bonded with the glue. So tightly it's under compression that it becomes one piece of wood because we cut it with the saw that's going to be difficult. So we want to add the extra strength of the screw here all right. So we don't run into problems down the road. So what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to put some pre-drilled holes in here because i want that screw to go exactly where i want it. And into this trim. So i'm going to pre-drill my hole [music] getting the screws in before i start is like having an extra pair of hands all right here we go okay i don't really need to take the glue that far do i going over the tile what am i thinking all right here we go. Now this is where having that center line comes in handy you want to hold that center line together. Now you want to put your pressure right here make sure your sill is nice. And flush because it's pre-drilled it's going to go into that meat before you sink that screw all the way in make sure all the other screws are started because you could tilt everything out of position all right. Now we're ready we actually want to drive the screw in until it's past the surface. And that gives us perfect compression you want to do this until you have a hole that can be filled. And anybody who's a fan of my channel knows what's coming next we're going to get some 45 foot mix it up. And fill that in that way we can sand it back off have a perfect paintable surface all right we're getting there. Now just a note if you go to a proper trim supplier they do make this nosing as a one piece if your window is the right dimension because our house is old the dimensional number is thicker than usual. And i added an extra layer on top of the finished wood siding i did not expect my window to bring it all the way in far enough that i could do this one piece turns out that i needed a half an inch more than the regular stock. So that's why i had to do a two piece doing it this way is nice. And simple if you were doing the one piece you could literally just measure the whole length that you wanted okay. And then you would just cut the l's out of the piece. And you still have to buy a piece of bullnose to do the rounded edge right. So it's kind of like i like doing two piece just because i have all that flexibility i don't have to worry about making mistakes here we go that is awesome. Now we just have to put on our casing let's do that this is as simple as measuring roughly right right there. So i just translate my mark on here. And i put my pencil mark on a 45. And i'll get another couple pieces. And we'll do that yeah about there. Now just for fun because i've leveled everything i should be able to take both of these marks. And they should be in the same spot okay there we go. So i'm going to just put a little bit of a mark on there. So i know i'm going to go cut these. And install them. Now i enjoy the dewalt gun. But there is one feature that drives me nuts this gun doesn't stop shooting nails when it runs out if you're like me i used to have a rigid gun. And i'd tell you i don't know why i bought this must been on sale or something. But the rigid gun it always stops when you run out of nails i don't know how many times i've been just going along nailing in baseboards can't tell when you're out of nails you turn around everything's falling off the wall you're like anyway i don't know why i needed to share that i needed the vent dewalt fixture gun here we go gonna get that on my mark that i like. And i'm driving these nails right into the jamb that's all i've got to work with okay. Then i'm going to measure. And cut my top piece. And i need to have the flexibility to make sure everything closes up perfect there we are okay. So because we cut the jm square the same dimensions i don't have to crawl up to the top to measure this all i do is take this measurement across the bottom. And i can cut the top piece. And put my miters on it's no problem. Now this is a just a 16th shy of 39. Nice all right remember wherever you have raw wood to raw wood got a glue i'm going to tell you every time i do it because if you don't your joints are guaranteed to crack if you have cracking joints on your window trim. And your baseboards it's because they aren't gluing it properly there's just no two ways around it some things in life you can make pretty for a weekend. But if you want it to be pretty forever you just gotta do it right okay i'm not even gonna think about this i have three quarter inch wood i'm gonna throw a nail in it. Now love nail guns by the way you know in the old days you'd  pull off the trim that have this two inch spike that they had to put in with a hammer god to be a finished carpenter back in the day unreal what they had to go through all right. Now we just want to make sure our gap is right. Now in our jam of course we still have the piece underneath to do we still have to do the caulking. And the putty. And the filler oh i think we should probably get to all that in just a second here this is the door casing it's massive right this is a smaller version of the same trim. So it has the same trim profile just without the flat piece which makes it larger this makes a great decorative detail underneath it was also the perfect size for me because i've got these huge windows in a kitchen. And i needed two counter plugs. So in order to make room obviously i put the plugs on the side. And i use a laser level to mount those. So that everything is perfect. Now this leaves me just enough room to get my cover plates on amazing i'll take what i have. And i'll show you two options for finishing underneath one is the same thing you cut the 45 return piece just like we did with the other. And you know what that's such a small piece of wood i'm just going to let that sit there there's another situation where i'll use painters tape. But i never use tape when i paint that's just how it works baby there we go there we go that's all i need i'll set that aside to dry. So here's one option i set the saw on 25 degrees. And just a straight cut okay there's no return trim you can paint that in. And you get that look that's not terrible right. Now the way that you would install this especially over tile is you've got to really be thinking. Now because you want to shoot on an angle just underneath that detail trim up into the up into the sill okay. And you can do that. And then you're not actually attaching this to the tile you don't have to use no nails or any kind of adhesives you just throw a few nails up there. And you're good to go when we're all done we're going to put a thin line of silicone on here just to seal it up. And that would be the solution to that problem here we go okay. So we have that option. And we have this option. And you get to decide which one you like personally i'm a big fan of cutting trims back to the return they look sort of similar. But i just like that detail from the side when you're using thick trim how it looks from the side is important okay. So today is crown molding day. And i am,https://youtu.be/dyDJjPWbRHU?t=3737,"['What type of lumber stock are used for window trim in an 1880 farmhouse kitchen?', 'Why is it recommended to use a laser level when installing windows?', 'How does expansion foam help with thermal breaks in old houses?', 'What is the purpose of using shims in window installation?', 'Can you explain the difference between cutting trims back to the return and using painters tape for finishing underneath?']"
5622.0,7448.0,Doors,PL34cQkzKfXWZmwLKoU375GqFWuDzVVYhc,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z,dyDJjPWbRHU,How To Trim Doors Windows and Baseboards | A to Z: Finish Carpentry Crown Molding,9c936113-194f-8676-4862-826660cffb43,Okay. So today is crown molding day. And i am excited because my delivery came i have a special plaster face how do you call it styrofoam crown molding it's pretty cool stuff. And it's really awesome for the diy-er because you can get amazing performance with really easy installation all by yourself. But i figured hey if i'm going to do that let's do a video we'll show the differences between doing the wood crown. And that crown. And that way no matter which material you choose you'll have the tools. And the secrets. So you can be successful. So i went by my trim shop because i had to get some stuff for the windows. And i grabbed a couple pieces of wood crown molding. Now just a word of warning if you're using wood remember depending on the moisture content of the wood at the time that it gets milled you might have differences in sizes as far as a finished product is concerned when you go to install it that's the only downside to using wood it is a little inconsistent as far as making really good miter joints. But that's what caulking is for. So let's get into it. So before we get started i need to cut myself a cheat piece. And this is important because wood has movement. And warp. So what you want to do is have about a two foot long section with an inside. And an outside miter on it. So that when you're installing your wood you can use that to help roll your corners just perfectly i'll show you all this information in a second. But first let's get this just done here [music] [applause] most types of crown have a very similar property in the fact that they are designed to be a perfect representation of the angle no matter which way you install it which means that the distance from the back of the fence to the to the front of the crown here. And the back of the fence to the top of the crown here is exactly the same when it's installed flush against both surfaces all right. Now you can double check with a tape measure. But what i do is i like to set my crown up grab myself a black marker because this just makes the whole day. So much faster. And i'll mark my fence watch this there's my line okay. Now when i'm working i know exactly where to set this i just walk up roll it until it's in position. And i can cut the other thing you can do. Now that it's in there nice. And tight you can set up your 45 line going in both directions all right. Now your saw is all set up. So that you don't have to pull out the tape measure or roll things around the last thing you need to know. And this is difficult is the detail generally speaking the beefier detail goes at the bottom. And this this liner profile goes to the top. So all this extra detail here you want to keep that very consistent. And make sure you pay attention to that because if you're installing you've cut it upside down nothing's going to line up it'll drive you crazy. So okay i'm making this really obvious that's the bottom that's the top when you put it in your saw here we go you actually want to not cut it this way you actually want to cut it upside down okay. Now here's the secret if that confuses you at all stand behind your saw when you're looking at your cuts. And you'll be like it just makes sense. Now because. Now you're looking at it the same way you will be when you lift it up. And put it on the ceiling okay. And it can get a little confusing. But you have to cut your crown upside down. So that all you have to do is move 45 degrees inside. And outside corner with a saw setup perfect 90. Now as long as you do that you'll be very very successful the last thing you want to do is this remember the devil is in the details whenever you're working with finished carpentry like a crown molding. And you're doing miters the most important element is this the saw is set to lock at 45 degrees in one direction. But you have to be 90 degrees here. So grab your square roll your guard out okay actually i'll do it from this side. And then slide your square against your blade if you have contact here. But not here. Then make adjustment in the back you can't cut anything like that because none of your joints are going to line up. So just roll it back until it's perfect. And then lock it in place. Now we're ready to go you can use this system here to set your degree cut. But the reality is is your your your little your detail here that's showing you what angle you're at is in a set screw. And it may or may not be perfect. So it's better to always check with your saw with the square which isn't going to lie to you. Then something like this that can move around over time. So let's get to our demonstration. Now we're dealing with softwood lumber here. So we don't need to worry about putting blocking in behind the walls. And that sort of thing we can install this just with caulking. And brad nails guaranteed to be fine. But what you want to do is you want to hold your profile put it up in the space all right. And i'm going an inside corner. So you want your miter to be facing towards you this one isn't very pretty. So i'm going to cut it again remember i'm going to put it upside down drop it on the fence really quickly with my lines that's my location i'm going to turn. And cut [applause]. And just for fun this is only a 10 inch saw you don't need to have a big powerful machine you don't need compound miter sliding all those bells. And whistles 200 gets you a quality saw just be sure to put a quality blade on it find yourself an 80 tooth for finished carpentry. So i'm using a door. And window latex caulking with silicone which is an elastomeric property. So it doesn't crack over time oh one second i didn't open this thing up yet this one's brand new there we go cut the tip on an angle slide it in. And with latex caulking there's nothing to puncture you just go right ahead all we do is run a little bead right here on the bottom okay. And then right on the top [applause]. Now i've got my profile sheet. And i stick it in the corner. And you can see they both feel pretty flush to the wall in the ceiling. But they're not the same spot. So what i got to do is find that happy place where they line up. And if i have a gap at the top i have a gap up here it means i need to roll this piece up onto the ceiling. And so. Now i've got the the bottom at the same spot i'll roll both of them together until the gap is closed there we go. Now i've got it in position just take out the nail gun shoot up the detail that's not going anywhere. Now the way you finish that of course is just use a caulking tube. And you want to put a nice bead of caulking up here okay there we go. Now a lot of people fill their nail holes with the with the caulking as well that's fine if your if your trim is nine or ten feet in the air if you're only at eight feet that caulking is going to shrink. And you're going to see every single pinhole if you're walking through the house if you have a discerning eye. So i would suggest using more like a drywall compound or a glazing putty that you can fill all those holes that won't shrink. Now now that i've shown you how the wood properties work let's go do the other way. So here's my new product this is styrofoam. Now it's a pretty medium density styrofoam. So it's actually a lot stronger than just the old white stuff you used to have in your basements. But it is plaster faced okay it's this brown application pretty sure it's amazing because it can actually do curved walls because it can twist when it's in this curved position. So awesome the benefit for us is that it installs using drywall compound that's it nice. And simple. So your butt joints are just square cut your miter joints you just put mud in the corner. And squeeze it all together. And wipe it out with a sponge let's get to this installation i'll show you how different it is. And all the different techniques for cutting this one on the sock one of the first benefits that you see right away is that these trims come in a variety of size. And because it's a styrofoam look at the length of that that's almost two inches of profile contacting with the wall that makes it incredibly easy to attach to the surface also makes it easy to set on your your saw you just literally set it in place. And you know you're good okay there's no real variance here if it's not tight you'll tell you just give it a little push good to go same thing applies though leave the majority of your detail for the bottom. And of course we're cutting upside down first cut we have here is an inside miter i need a little bit more room there we go set this out of 45 make sure your blade of course is 90 to the table. And off we go. So one of the benefits of using this material you don't need the nail gun or the compressor which means if you're a homeowner. And you own a saw you've got all the tools you need to put in crown molding this is just awesome that's just freaking awesome i wonder if there's gonna be big enough look at that okay well it seems that my ten inch saw is just a hair shy no worries i have a knife i can finish the cut with that awesome. Now this is a pretty large profile you can get them a little smaller or a little larger if you dare if you have a 12 inch saw you'll be in great shape. Now that's my outside corner i first need to do i need to measure. Now there's three ways to measure inside cornered inside corner for crown molding i would recommend taking a look you can measure across the bottom. And you can run past your corner. And read the tape in that situation that would be 73. And 7 8. You can put it inside. And bend your tape in. And take your best guess or you can leave it like this. And run it across. And you can take the actual measurement where it contacts the tape. And then check your tape. And it'll have the actual dimension of the tape itself. And you can add those two numbers together depending on the situation i use all three different techniques. But again. So this situation here because i have inside corners it's a lot easier for me to just run the tape right past i'm going to go 73. And 7 8. Good to go. So remember you want to measure from the outside of this point okay 73. And 7 8 is our number this is the bottom. And once you get used to this it will move actually quite quick 73. And 7 8. It's right there. And i also want to put a mark it's an inside corner coming back this way one of the reasons i love having my saw on a stand is because when you have space confines you can just slide it down. And give yourself a little more room all right here we go again set to 45 we can just bring this down. Now because you're dealing with the material that's getting applied with drywall compound all of these inside corners even if they're not perfect are going to be filled up. And smoothed them with a wet sponge for the drywall compound even if you have to cut it. And it's a little off it's going to be just fine all right here we go. So now we have our piece of crown last thing you want to do is just go up. And double check if you've cut it a little bit too long. And it's sitting bowed. Then it's not going to adhere to the wall very well that's going to be awesome you really want to roll it around back. And forth until it's snug in the wall just like it was on this offense okay. And then just to help visually you can make your marks here we go. Now we can put the mud on. And stick in place. So now we're using all-purpose compound for drywall. Now the secret is this when you buy your drywall compound it actually needs to have water mixed in with it to make it nice. And smooth. So if you're interested in that process you're not familiar with that you can click this video link right here. And you can watch how we prepare the mud. But if you've already been through this process. And you're in a renovation. And you've been doing the drywall this will be really easy if you're not used to using a drywall knife this could be challenging. Then i would suggest just start with a little bit at a time okay. And you want to just kind of use it like a snow plow. And then flatten it out okay you don't need to have too much mud here because it's just going to all end up coming out all over the ceiling. And making a huge mess there we go we're looking for positive contact. And that's it. Now you've got two options you can add the compound to the the trim piece or you can add it to the wall in the ceiling area if you've already got finished walls. And ceiling you're probably going to want to add it to the trim be patient this does not dry very fast. So you got lots of time to work with it all right. So now we're going to start on the corner. And follow the line how to put on the wall we're just going to roll it in place okay i'm gonna put pressure on the top. And the bottom just to make sure that it holds in place there we go isn't that nice hey like wood trim this one you want to just use a little bit of drywall compound to do your seam. Now all right put that in there you go okay we just wipe all that in there we are pretty same thing holds true you can always come back when it's dry take your latex window. And door caulking put that on the bottom of the top get a perfect finish. Now we're gonna do the inside corner joint as well as a butt joint i'll show you all those techniques as well. And then you'll be able to do crown in your house. So the only downside of this type of crown is because it's getting shipped to your home directly which is not a bad thing it only comes in eight foot lengths. Now because it does such a great job with the joints it doesn't really matter. But you don't want to waste any of this. So my next piece is eight foot. And five eighths five inches. So i'm just going to reuse this golf cut here. And start my next row wow that's the only waste that's a pretty good deal here we go. Now because i'm going to be doing a butt a butt joint here i want to just do a little trim on this make sure that my joint is going to be perfect there we go. Now remember this is an inside corner. So i actually want to put the compound all over the inside of that corner as well okay. And you can be liberal here you don't have to worry about putting too much the biggest danger here is using not enough. And we'll stick that in there roll the top up to close the gap look at that okay i'm just going to clean that excess off with my finger. Now for long pieces of this trim they're going to recommend you put some sort of temporary bracing in place. And that can be nails or screws just tapped in underneath or if you have some zip wall you can use these these things are awesome done all right i'm gonna take my sponge i'm gonna work my corner we'll be able to come back a little bit later. And perfect. And add some caulking on this at the ceiling joint. So we don't get expansion cracks. But we'll also be able to use our latex caulking on the inside corners if you want to. But you could finish up just by taking a fingering of this mud. And sliding it back up from that gap again just like this. And that makes a really nice joint. Now that i'm happy with my corner i'm just going to take a screw put it underneath my trim here give it a little love tap. Now i can take this out. And use it on my next joint remember the drywall compound takes overnight to dry. So you've got all kinds of time to get around the room roll all your corners perfect. And then tack your screws in i just like to use the poles as i go. So nothing falls on my head. So here we are we're going to do our inside corner whenever you're cutting a long piece the to go into a butt joint always do the angle first remember the butt joint here is going to be on our left. But our piece is upside down. So we want to do an inside corner. And give ourselves as much material to work with as we can. Now we're going to measure from the inside corner to the butt joint 81. And 5 8. Because we're going to be cutting it straight we can turn it around. And lay it flat that makes it a lot easier to measure. So i did my measurement based on the tip it comes to here. But i really want to translate that measurement to the other side because that's where the saw will come in contact first. So i'm putting my my square on here making my mark there we are you can roll it up a little bit if you need to all right. Now i intentionally cut this about a 32nd of an inch too long i like the idea having just a little bit of compression to help hold it in place here we go. So we're going to roll this in. Now oh i forgot didn't put any mud on the end joint there that is going to cause me problems there we go okay. And just like we did the last time oh this is well done i just fell off my ladder matt there we go are you okay yep of course i'm okay fell off my ladder didn't die. So now we want to put enough compression on these joints. And position them. So they're both in the same place here we go that makes it seamless wow here we go that is beautiful i love it not bad eh ah this is one of these things where i never tried this product before i'm a big fan of working with wood right i don't even use mdf i just like using wood. Now it's a little messy obviously. But if you're working alone super lightweight. And easy to install like i'm gonna have to finish this video off with  coming back tomorrow to film the finished product after we've done the caulking. And the paint process. And you're gonna be able to see in just a few seconds how amazing this finished product looks wow okay. So it's the next day. And all the mud is nice. And dry. So i'm going to use my window. And door caulking to seal up all the gaps. And then after a couple of hours that'll also be dry enough to paint we'll come by. And do our first paint application. And then we're also going to take our sanding sponge out. And just go around looking for minor imperfections that we can touch up because if i can see it on a ladder. Then i should take care of it because there's a chance that i'll see it from standing on the ground. But if i can't see it on a ladder. Then it doesn't exist even if it's there here we go just  have a nice angle on your the tip there. And if you're pulling this way pointing the other way. Then you can leave enough material there that you can fill it with a concave kind of look there we go all right nice. And gentle here just to put that that cove line in there there's too much material. And clean off your finger you don't want to just leave it on the ceiling make a mess here we go. Now once this is dry we'll come back. And we'll give it two shots of paint. And that's your opportunity after your first coat to really check to see if it's enough material there or did it dry. And shrink up during the process if it shrinks up too much you might want to put a second bead on there because you don't want to have shadows appearing at that joint it's really important to make sure that these little details are done really really well because that is going to be how you're judged on the overall performance all right. So we are going to go. And paint the trim. Now and we're using a semi-gloss paint. And i know that i'm from canada. And you all don't have access to dulux a lot of our european market does in the united states they're owned by the company called ppg. So they have access to the same technology paints. And they're probably labeled differently i'm not familiar with it yet i get to do a road trip. And discover the truth about that. But if you're looking for comparable paint companies sherwin-williams has a really nice product. And they're coast to coast all throughout north america benjamin moore line is nice some of the paints are different. And they function differently. So it's kind of odd there. But the most important thing to know is when you're buying paint the quality of the paint really is reflected in the price it's a pretty fair gamble that if you're buying paint at twenty dollars a gallon versus sixty five dollars a gallon you're getting value there. And it's worth the investment. So i would recommend don't be afraid to spend a little money especially on shrimp paint because this is one of these areas where if you don't have a good one you're going to be doing three or four coats to get the coverage. And it's going to be too thin. And every brush stroke is going to have dots of paint flying across the room. So it's really a nightmare feel free to buy a good quality paint here pour about an inch into the bottom of another container all right. And when i say that i mean this you can't paint from this can when it's full because all you can do is dab the paint. And then wipe it off there's no paint inside the brush. So with something like this you can actually pound the bottom of that can right. And fill up your brush. Now when you're painting trim you don't want to have too much paint on the outside of your brush obviously. But i'm telling right. Now this is full of paint. And i'm going to be able to go. And paint four to six linear feet of my trim with that. And i can carry it around with me. So i have enough paint in here to do the entire crown molding that whole room this is how you do it right okay by the way if you haven't seen our paint videos about the tools. And stuff that we use. Then you're really going to want to check that out the link is right here all of the gear my ladder all my tips. And tricks are in there. And i guess we're going to have links for all of the locations where you can pick that material up as well. So go ahead. And check the video out it'll be a lot of help to you regarding this i really should have done a code on this material before i installed it. But the reality is is it got delivered late. And i was getting a little excited to get the video shot. So now i got to do two coats while i'm here having said that the first coat is more of a base coat primer coat just to get coverage the second coat is the finished coat. And after i do this first coat i'm going to go around. And look for little minor imperfections do a little sanding i've got a couple of nicks here these are actually dents from my saw guard listen learned. And also going to take the brush with the ceiling paint. And do a new cut line okay once i've established my line. Then the second coat i'll come back. And do a nice finish clean cut my danger here is if i do a perfect cut with the semi-gloss. Now i'm gonna have this painter's caulking on the ceiling unpainted. And what that means is that over time it'll gray. And it'll start getting a dark line there. So you have to make sure that when you're painting you always paint your paintable caulking every time the only time you're not going to paint is if you're using pure silicone. But siliconized caulking will go gray. So i'm going to get my first coat on i'm not going to be too picky about my cut line i'm going to come back with the ceiling paint. And then hit it again. And i'm not going to show all that whole process for you here we go. So a little dab will do pound that into the bottom of the can get some paint in your brush. And look at all of that control right i'm not flinging paints everywhere i'm not dripping i don't even have a drop cloth on my new kitchen floor here all right there we are i'm not painting like a wild man i'm just trying to get that cut line in there i'm going to get some all over the ceiling. And that's fine after you get your first coat on the texture of the surface gets nice. And slippery. And easy for the paint to glide around while it's textured like this you really got to force the paint in it's hard to do a nice cut line. So let's not be picky here we just want to get it on get some good coverage try not to get too much on the ceiling. So then you don't have to do like a three inch wide swipe with the ceiling paint because that'll be noticeable. But to come back with the ceiling paint after the fact. And just do a little bit of a trim line it's not going to be an issue especially with all the downward light that we built into this house with the pot lights which is one of the reasons why pot lights are. So popular in the marketplace all that down light means people aren't looking up at the ceiling it allows you a lot of freedom for imperfections here we go they aren't popular because they're sexy they're popular because they hide problems every time the builders come up with a new product the first thing you gotta ask yourself is what are they trying to hide because if they're not hiding something they're not making any more money they're not going to be bringing that product to market okay here we go okay first coat looks pretty good from standing on the ground you're probably looking at that going oh that's all right the way it is. But trust me when i say this taking the time to recut the ceiling. And doing a second coat. And a little sanding in between [music] it's going to be absolutely marvelous. So here we go it's time for the last coat of paint just take your sanding sponge out look for any issues there like some some dirts in there or anything like that sanding sponges are awesome because they'll follow the contour of the work make sure everything is perfectly smooth okay. And then same as before push the paint in the brush don't want to use too much all right. Now there we go we don't have to paint that lead edge on there the second time all the way around we just need to get a little bit on there that's good more importantly it's the body of this trim detail. And you want to paint. And stretch it out until your lines are gone okay you don't want to leave any lines in your paint. Now most of these paints are made with technology or while it's drying it'll blend it'll soften up. But if you leave lines in your trim paint you're gonna have lines there forever. And then it'll look really bad. So feel free less is more when you're working with trim paint just slopping on the paint will make a mess less is more just a couple linear feet at a time work it back. And forth. Now i don't know if the camera sees this. But there's a bunch of lines here. So maybe it's just the lighting. But i can see them because i'm standing right here right. And so i obviously had too much paint in my brush i'm going to just stretch my brush out. And dry it up a little bit i'm going to come back. And get rid of my lines there we go okay,https://youtu.be/dyDJjPWbRHU?t=5622,"['What is the main difference between using wood and styrofoam crown molding?', 'How do you measure inside corners for crown molding?', 'Why is it important to cut crown molding upside down?', 'Can you use a nail gun with styrofoam crown molding?', 'How do you finish the edges of styrofoam crown molding?']"

So the gable ends you got to go to the store. And get some hardware these little inside corners are all you need little l brackets. Now i like to always have my stickers on the inside. So if you see your sticker you know you're on the inside. Now you don't really need four of these bad boys do you traditionally these panels are designed for being installed past the hardware. And the rail to the wall surface. So they're actually wider than you need for an island situation. So you want to keep that in mind you want to have this extending past the edge of the cabinet the same depth as your doors. And your drawer faces which i have right here. So i'm going to put my panel flush with the front of the cabinet. And you can see there's my door right this i don't want sticking past that. So i'm actually going to go to 24. And a half. So 24. And a quarter inches for these panels okay. So okay. So i wrote down the width on the piece of tape for later once the guy for the countertop measuring has come. And gone i'm going to take this apart cut down my width of my panel. And the height of my panel in in this case it is 1-5 8. For the purpose of measuring i'm going to install it here. But when i actually put it together later i'm going to install it like this because i'm gonna buy a 24 inch door to go on the front of this on the front of that panel as a decorative feature okay to make it look like a fake door that way it'll line up a lot by nicer. But for the purpose of measuring a counter. So that we don't confuse anybody [applause] we're going to just attach this. So we get our outside measurements for the whole counter. And they don't mess that up. Now the way we're going to do this is just take some l brackets. And tape we're going to tape these in place nice. And flush. And run our screws all through the tape [music] all right that's why that is important i'm using socket screws they're just really tiny they're 3 8 not designed really for the wood. But if you push hard enough you'll make good contact. And you don't come when it comes to the other side which is the most important part of this remember the other side of this panel is visible when it's all finished. So you don't want to take a chance of screwing that up all right. Now this panel goes to here. And this panel goes here i'm just going to use a little bit of tape to hold this outside corner together done. And start screwing. Now this seems like an awful lot of work to go through to kind of arbitrarily attach this for. Now but i know these cabinet guys [music]. And they hate taking measurements until everything is in place the truth is they'd rather all the appliances are installed as well. But i don't care because every one of these guys does the same thing they come out here they'll do their measuring. And then they're going to make me sign off on it. And they're going to make me take responsibility for any of the mistakes that are made based on measurements. So if i'm going to take responsibility for it i would rather just say add the other 51-5 baits that i've got measured on my wall. And i don't have to go through these nuts. But [music] for the purpose of the demonstration today i'm going to show you what you're going to expect from a cabinet guy who isn't going to be very nice. And play ball with you like that because. Then most likely not going to be very friendly about you having this in the wrong place. So here we go. Now i can establish my outside corner for the end of my island. So here we are i'm putting this in position. And i'll tell you why a lot of these countertop guys are bringing in a laser level system. And they want to have a position for the laser clips they'll put a clip here put a clip there. And so on. And then they'll turn on the machine it automatically detects the location of all those clips. And does all the measurements. And puts it in the diagram in their computer that's why if you don't have the outside edges established the computer's got nothing to work with. So i got to use this. And i've got to put a 5 8 something or other over there off the edge. And what i'll probably end up doing is grabbing a piece of plywood. And i'll just screw it to the outside of this cabinet for. Now that'll solve that problem. And then they're gonna the computer will automatically add the overhang. So that'll take care of it. So now i'm established actually i'm ready to go because i've got 24 inches plus 24 inches plus this gable which is actually going to sit in between the middle this recom this actually establishes the outside dimension of my island. And if i'm right all of this i'm at 102. And a half right. Now and if i add the other 5 8 103. And an eighth that's about as close as i'm going to get today. Now when they are measuring your countertop they're going to throw an extra inch on each side. So you have a little bit of variance a little bit of wiggle room the important thing is here. Now that this is established we have one last chance to make sure that we're happy with the location in the room not just the depth here off of these off the back wall. But also other features like when you're walking around the outside of the island. So one of my favorite design elements about the ikea kitchen is that they always have these gables right. So we have a take a look at the drawer cabinet you can see you see that's the end of the box. But then these gable elements come out. And they extend past the box to encapsulate all your doors. And drawers. Now they come 26 by 36. So the 24 inch cabinet is usually when you put this on up against a wall you're finding they give it a little extra room. So that you can scribe them into place they're also amazing in an island because it can encapsulate both sides this is why they're 26 inches i'll just demonstrate this before we cut the height in this scenario i can go full extension over here for that side. And then over here i can put a back panel on. And i have enough depth left over to add a back panel. And decorative doors. So if i wanted to do a replication of all doors across the back of this to look like cabinets. Then you can do that. And you would be perfectly fine to do that what we're doing is actually we're going to be doing a build out in a custom made back side of the island. So we're going to leave the full extension on it. But i've got to measure. And cut for the height. Now the way you do that is you don't want to cut the gable at the countertop that's a mistake okay that'll be very noticeable. And very ugly. So find a surface where you can lay it down always sticker side up that means this is the inside of the cabinet okay. And generally you want to do something like mark the top. So you can keep your reference okay just take your measuring tape because especially in an old house like this nothing's ever level go 34 34. And an eighth. And you measure from the top down use a straight line connect the dots. And then we'll run it out to the saw one thing to pay attention to when you're opening up your boxes it says don't use a knife it means down the side here because this is the finished panel there's not a lot of mercy there right. But there's a little box right here always save the box because this is custom sized screws for attaching the panel to the cabinets if you go to the hardware store. And you buy cabinet screws you're going to find them are going to come at one. And a quarter inch long. Now you're ready for this this screw is one. And an eighth all right. And the difference is this i'll just take this random panel here if you were to measure. And put this screw up here let's say we're screwing from inside the cabinet i got lots of room there right that looks great if that screw was a little bit further that's like the standard in a box is one. And a quarter you only have an eighth of an inch material left. And because this is like a high density fiber board okay what happens when you drive that screw in at one. And a quarter you get little raised dents in the panel. So you don't want to have that ugly look. So make sure you set aside these screws because they are a life saver. Now these screws are amazing you can use the pre-drilled holes if you like doesn't really matter. But i'm old school. And you just drive it until the drill says otherwise there we go beautiful. So the last thing i'm going to show you about the ikea system is of course the baseboard. Now if you remember i told you at the beginning of the video save these little weird shape looking things. And here's why the way this all installs once we get rid of the packaging this stuff here is like for model airplanes break it off. And you can stick it on the end if you have an exposed end. But since we're using all these end panels we don't have need of that there we go this system is simple you put these in you can rotate them. And lock them in position. And they lock on the legs right nice. And easy all you have to do is cut the length. And then the height. Now there's two sides to this one end has a little rubber gasket here. And it's designed to keep water from getting under the counter when you wash your floors. And the other side is designed for easy cutting. So you can cut the height remember the legs for these counters are adjustable. So you might have a situation like i do in my old house where you have to scribe a little bit the detail on this. But that's no big deal. Now for the purpose of our education today i went ahead. And i prepped this one up for us okay. And i'll show you how easy it is to snap these things in place just get down into position here. So remember when we put the feet together we have these adjustable discs that slide up. And down. And we're going to put these down. Now near the bottom. And what that does is it sets a depth the same as the ring okay that sets. So this will end up square when you push it all together there we go. Now we got to get that in there. And all we do is slide it in place there we go. And snap it on baseboards. Now the the feature here that we're going to talk about just for a couple minutes give you an idea unfortunately we weren't able to film on the day that this one in this is life right huge renovation project going on here what it is is a barn board it's bought from a design store comes in two different widths okay what they've done is they've taken these old boards. And they've sliced them right down the middle. So they're only half an inch thick. And then all you have to do to install this stuff is really a few stages one you want to paint the surface behind it it comes with imperfections. And knot holes. And little angles. And chips missing. And if you paint a nice dark brown or a dark gray or something like that. Then when you install this board. And you look at the wall you aren't going to see the wall board behind it or whatever surface it is like on this particular part i've got grey cabinet on one side from ikea. And the other side is an osb panel. And i didn't want two different knot holes showing that there's a different back on each side it looks stupid. So we paint it. And then when we let the paint dry the way we install this use a laser level set up your line okay install your first row using a 23 gauge nailer not an 18 gauge nailer it's called a pin nailer. And the holes in the surface of this wood are. So small you can't even find them if you look for them the reason for that is this we're using pl premium adhesive strips setting the wood into the glue. And then just throwing a couple of pins on to hold it in place until it dries that's it. And this is just solid as a rock it's not going to go anywhere it looks great. And it's an awesome way to add texture. And color. And design to a relatively simple room like this kitchen,https://youtu.be/dyDJjPWbRHU?t=7448,"['What type of hardware do you need for the inside corners of your panel?', 'Why are you using socket screws in your project?', 'How do you determine the outside dimensions of your island?', 'What is the purpose of the laser level system used by countertop guys?', 'How do you attach a barn board to a wall with imperfections?']"

So there's no access panel. So you have no ability no shut off vals speaking of shut off vals did you turn off the water to the house yet no not yet rule number one matt when touch in the bathroom turn off the water drain the lines this is the third story we have an accident. Now we got a lot more work to do here than we planned on all right look get that taking care of sounds good okay. So you can see here come on in. And have a good look at this max these tubs are installed in new homes what they do is they create a wooden bench they cut out. And then they drop the tub in. And then they tile. Now on occasion they'll get tile. And they'll prop the tub up. And they'll put the tile underneath. But that doesn't happen too darn often usually the standard procedure is to cut the tile around gro it. And then silicone. So this tub is basically the last it's like set in. And you can remove it without even touching the tile which is a huge advantage cuz with the tub gone demolishing the rest of this stone. And framework is really easy with the tub here you've got to smash every tile pull every screw you can't get a saw all in properly. So this is how you would take this out. And then you can actually take this down to habitat for humanity when you're done. So before we take off the tub what you need to understand is is basically when we're doing demolition we're under uninstalling that which was installed. So your your roman tub faucet system comes in two parts there's the rough in. And then there's the trim. So once you remove the trim from the tub you disconnect the waist. And overflow. Now you can just lift the tub right out there's nothing else holding this down. But gravity. So there's usually a little hole [music] here let's just double check yep the water's off good boy do that take off the handle this is threaded [music] on okay. And then that one is silic coned into place that's just lovely this ring here has got an oval shape to it. And it's just turned to lock everything in place. So what we need to do basically is just take our hand hammer turn that ring it's kind of like that old toy we had as kids you know you had to match up the shapes in the puzzle. And then it'll just lift right off. Now the part that you see here is actually mounted underneath the tub. And it's not going anywhere. So we repeat this process. And then we can just lift the tub out. Now the spo itself has a little access panel here.

And a little bit of water never hurt anybody this one has this little ren here you just slide that out slide that off that's it for that one of course we going to take this one off as well same system here [music] you can see how this is independent. Now of the tub okay tub is free to lift out as soon as we remove the drain. And the way overflow i left my drain remover tool at the other bathroom i'm working on. So what we're going to do is i'm going to demonstrate a little trick that you can use if you don't want to buy the remover tool throw your hammer in there this is just threaded on once you get it started. Now the overflow is disconnected of course this is a push drain you just got a good grip grab that. So this little guy here is just a pain it's plastic we'll just be done with that put them in the hole. And we're going to be turning [music] counterclockwise. And once you get it going [music] any silicone that a plumber may or may not have used will be rendered ineffective. And you can just use that counter torque action. And unthread it little bumps. And bruises. And scrapes are part of the game there we go. Now we're ready to rip this out of here. So before we can remove the tub it's a pretty deep it's a two-man silver tub. So what we're going to do is we're going to just remove this door usually like to leave the doors on because they're great for dust control. But in this case that extra inch.

And a quar is going to be necessary just punch a hole to the bottom. And that's it it's that easy yeah matt here we go we'll just set that outside we don't want to throw this out yet we want to put it back on. So quick tip whenever you take a door off take the hinge pin put put it back this way you know where to find them when you go to put the door bag on you'll always lose them if you put them on the floor in a pocket the tub how heavy do you think it is 70 lb probably not quite that bad okay. Now it shouldn't be attached anything i've cut the silicone i removed all the fixtures let's see if we can get lucky. And just give it a yank yep it's going to be okay. So now that the tub is totally removed all we have to do is lift it out not that heavy although it is a little easier to do if you're not in the tub at the time yeah seriously yeah bugger. So here's the trick the my bear claw i'm lifting straight up we grab a hold of that. Now it's on a plywood platform. And so if we keep it level matt yeah it'll just pop right out okay. And then there we go classic he all right this is crazy. But check this out i don't know why. But every time i pull out a tub somebody has left a bunch of crap garbage in the tub area this is insulation there's nothing here to insulate the walls all closed off the installation is on the other side of that wallboard this is just somebody i mean they're not insulating in this tub to keep the heat in or there'd be like a lot of insulation.

And today's video i'm going to demonstrate this  inspection camera this camera was sent out to us by a company. And you know it was a gift we always tell people you can send out whatever you want i'm going to try it for a while if i like it you might get a video you might get an article in the forum whatever. And that's the case here. So they sent out this camera can be used to inspect sewers conduit ductwork pretty well anywhere that you can stick a camera with a cable on you should be able to use this wet or dry i've been playing around with it a little bit. And i can definitely see some benefits to my own renovation business. And as well to even  even folks who are flipping houses you know you could pay for this pretty quickly you know in today's age of everybody wants inspections on their sewers. And that sort of thing this this camera in canada here retails i've seen as high as 700 when you think about a two to four hundred dollar cost to have somebody come in. And do an inspection for you. And give you that recording  you know a couple flips. And you got this thing paid for. And there's going to be a million other things i think that you'll find that you'd use it for,https://youtu.be/Vyklk2SwXEo?t=0,"['What type of inspections can the camera be used for?', 'How does the camera work with wet or dry conditions?', 'Can the camera be used in sewers and conduit?', 'Is the camera suitable for renovation businesses?', 'How much does a typical inspection cost compared to purchasing the camera?']"

So anyways i just want to run through some of the basic features of this this unit it's all all one unit which is nice i really like that. So everything comes as you see  it's pretty compact like really it's got a good hard case. So you can throw this in the backseat of the truck. And not worry about it getting damaged really some are a little more you know the screen isn't protected that sort of thing. So they're not quite as as  robust i guess. So anyways they did send us this out  they're not paying us to do a review i'm going to give you my likes. And dislikes about it here in a few minutes. But first let's just have a look at the unit itself. So as you've seen it's in the stand it'll stand up on its own it's well well weighted well balanced. But when you're using it it's going to be used in this type of position okay. So they've got a clip here that basically keeps the spool from turning when you when you're not wanting it to turn okay your camera is in here right in here let's build just got to get it out of there that's the one thing i found a little clumsy with it once you've got it out. And started it's good to go. So you've got a color camera led lighting i've put this protector on it which this unit comes with. So when i'm pushing it through places it just keeps it up off the surface a little bit. And protects the edge of the camera it's all stainless steel it's kind of got a spring end in it. So you can get around corners. And stuff a little easier inside the box here is all your your controls. And your viewing. So there's a few different things this is like a sun shade that you could put up here if you're using it outside i haven't used it outside yet. But it comes with that. So you can help you see the screen there's some instructions there's a bag of goodies here this you could you could actually remove this protector that i put on. And put this one on with the wheels. So if you're going inside i don't know what that is about a three inch diameter pipe or bigger this would just keep it up off the bottom a little bit i haven't actually used those at all i've just put this protector on it seems to be fine  comes with another little kit with there's some caps in there. And at first i thought they were they were caps for the to protect the lens. But there's not a big enough cap that covers that lens. So not real sure maybe when you take this all unscrew it maybe they're caps for the end of the air i'm not too sure a little screwdriver for mounting these accessories. But it basically comes with all that there's a charging cord there. And then inside oops actually i can lift it out i don't know why i'm lifting the whole thing inside here is the basically the main controls. And the battery. So there's a charging port an on off switch there's a dial here to adjust the brightness of the leds all your cable connections for video. And and everything are right there. So there is a display here when you turn it on tells you that you've got power gives you a battery indicator they say that a lot i haven't used it this long. But they say it'll last about eight hours which is pretty darn good really. So i'd have to believe them i haven't ran it that long continuously okay. So that all fits in there. And i'll just turn that on. And i don't wanna cameraman doesn't want to be on tv. So i'll make sure the camera isn't facing him. So i've turned on the unit here i'm going to power up the screen it's a nine inch lel  lcd screen not led it's an lcd screen. So pretty decent quality. But you can see it's got a pretty good quality camera especially at a close-up distance you know that pegboard over there is six feet away from the camera. And it's it picks everything up quite nicely. Now the nice thing about this it comes with a memory card. So there's a card right here i forget the size of the card. But anyways there's a card there. So you can record. And take photos as well of whatever you're looking at. So that's good if you're if you're actually in the business of doing sewer inspections you can you can record whatever you're doing. And give the homeowner a copy. So that's really nice there's another menu here for adjusting your contrast. And the time. And all that kind of stuff. So i don't think i need to go through that at all that all is  really good quality down here in the corner it's a little light you might not pick up on it. But it's actually got the date. And the time. And everything right there. So that's really good if you are you know in the business. And and need to record this for somebody. So basically what you're doing is whatever you're inspecting you're just feeding this camera down that tube or the pipe or the hose or duct or whatever you're going into. And as well on the on the cable some units will actually show the distance that you've gone on the screen this one doesn't. But they do have the they do have. And it's really hard to see. But there is markings on the cable this one's in meters  40 inches in a meter basically what i found is those are hard to find when you're actually you know you got it down the drain or whatever you're scoping. And you're also. And you're trying to see where this mark is. So what i did for a lot of this one is i put some extra marks all the way around the line here. So i can quickly identify that okay this is where i need to look for the for the distance marked on the cable. So that's just something i did i don't know how long that's going to last with cleaning. And handling. And everything. But that's what i did to to make it easier to find the to find the  the distance thing. So i'm just going to turn this off feed this all back in there feeds a little easier when i'm standing the right way. But so charger yeah i think i covered all the basics of what's included with this unit. Now my,https://youtu.be/Vyklk2SwXEo?t=81,"['What is the main feature of this unit that makes it compact and easy to transport?', 'How does the camera work with the provided clip?', 'What type of screen does the unit have?', 'Can you record video or take photos with the included memory card?', 'Are there any additional accessories included with the unit?']"

Now my likes. And dislikes like us like i said all these companies you want to send me out whatever i'll have a look at it. And if it makes a video or an article i'm giving my honest opinion. And i'm only giving that opinion after i've used it. So so these are my likes. And my. And my dislikes my likes i like the screen it's really good quality good size screen to be able to view whatever you're looking at i like that it has the ability to record. And take pictures that's that's awesome  it's fairly compact you know overall the unit you know considering this is a hundred. And 50 feet  what is that like 40 some meters 45 meters i just forget. So it's it's good length of coil. And it's still fairly compact. So i like that it's light i don't know what the weight is. But it basically weighs nothing  camera quality is really good. So that's all good oh yeah here's my other point it's 45 meters 150 feet. So has a good length of cable. And they they do have other models with longer. And shorter cables my dislikes right underneath here let me just close this up right underneath here this little piece of cable that comes out of the frame which comes from the camera unit or from the monitor unit. And then goes into this yellow cable i just have a little bit of fear about this piece of cable you know you got it in the truck or whatever. And that catches on something it's not well protected. So i think that could be a weak spot. So that's one of my dislikes  as i mentioned earlier the markings on the cable for the distance are very hard to find. And they're even when you find them they're pretty faint. So i think over time those maybe will wear off a little bit. And be even tougher to find  this clip which kind of keeps this from turning when you're not using it sometimes i find when you're unspooling it it wants to get caught up in here. And it jams up. And stuff i kind of wish i don't know i wish it was easier to take on. And off. And you could just set it off to the side. But i just find that it kind of gets in the way sometimes i'm just going to clip this. So those are my basic dislikes you know overall price wise for comparable unit i think you know they're pretty much on the money. And like i said for just a normal homeowner you maybe aren't going to go out. And spend seven hundred dollars for this type of thing or maybe you are i don't know. But there are some places. Now that are starting to rent these types of systems. So there's another option for you this may be renting if it's available in your area i think that's about all i can really say about the over overview of what it is why don't we take it inside. And show you how i use it,https://youtu.be/Vyklk2SwXEo?t=469,"['What is the approximate length of the cable on the unit?', 'How does the camera quality compare to other units in its class?', 'What are some common uses for a device like this?', 'Can you explain the difference between renting and buying a device like this?', 'What are some potential drawbacks to using a device with a long cable?']"

And show you how i use it okay we just moved inside to my own personal basement i have in my house what is called non-crowed sewer line. So back in the day somebody had a smart idea that we're going to take some layers of cardboard soak it in oil. And we're going to use that as a pipe  we're finding now 50 60 years later that in some soil conditions that really wasn't a great idea. So in my house i've got a cast pipe under the basement floor under the house basically. But then it goes into this non-crowed cardboard. And so this is a thing i regularly have to do is have every year my sewer line cleaned out because of tree roots they've found their way into some cracks or just busted their way through or whatever. And so it's just something regular maintenance we have done every year at least once a year. So i've pulled the carpet back like i always do i usually have somebody come in to to do that. And i probably will continue to do that. But now i can at least have a look  every. Now and again just to see how things are going down there. But my i'm basically at a clean out here. So i'm at the exterior wall of my basement. So this clean out is going down into the sewer. And out to the street  i've never had an issue with anything else going back to the other plumbing in the floor here i suppose. Now with the camera i could  investigate it someday myself. But we always start right here because the problem's always just outside  the basement that i have the problem i have is just outside usually all the time okay. So find some kind of clean out or something where you can access. And check your if you in our case we're doing the sewer if you're doing that that's that's great you're going to have a cap on there of some kind that you've got to pull off. So we'll just get this freed up it doesn't even too bad okay we'll get the cap out of the way. So i've got cast iron right here. And then it'll transition into the non-curred. So you notice i've got gloves on i'm working with the sewer. So i've got gloves on i've got some cleaning supplies here those are the basic things i need. Now i need to turn on the the camera okay. Now if you're doing this for somebody as a business it's always a good idea just to  we're going to hit record see it's changed the time. And when flashing record up there. But what i was going to say if you're doing this as a business or whatever or somebody's paying you to to provide a report or an inspection for them it's always a good idea just to take the camera when you first turn it on. And just just scan the room a little bit. So they can tell right from the beginning that this is actually their home you haven't just generically thrown some kind of  video of a pipe that's in somebody else's house. So they know that this inspection is their home okay. So we've got the recording going i've got things set up here i think that you can kind of see everything that's going on  i've also got a tap running just the cold water running just on low to allow a little bit of water draining in the pipe. And that just just kind of helps  do a couple things just gives a little bit of lubrication for the end of the camera as it's sliding along helps protect it maybe a little bit. And the other thing i like about it is it gives us a reference top or down sometimes when this feeds in there you know the camera spins around with the cable or whatever. And then you kind of lose track of what's up or down at least if you got a bit of water trickling through there you always know where the bottom of the pipe is. So so let's  i don't think there's anything else to really tell you about let's just give this a shot. So if you're watching the camera here we're going to start down the hole it does have the lights on there. So i might be playing without a little bit there that's that's full blast right there it's giving us a good good shot. So far. So we'll just continue to move down [applause]. So now i'm just coming to the bottom of the y. And you can see the water trickling there  in the bottom of the pipe like i said i ran just running a little bit of water looks like it's going to be enough. So it's still cast iron right here we'll just let the camera get settled down in the bottom. And get focused this is where i was talking about the strap seems to get in the way it's i don't know what to do about that it's kind of a pain honestly. So there we are you can see like i said the camera doesn't always orientate itself up. And down. So we can see this is the bottom of the of the pipe because we can tell where the water is flowing oh actually. And i've got the camera there i needed to flip it over i was looking back into the house there okay. So we'll just maybe that's a little too much light for reflection we'll just continue on in there. So you can see it the water is at the top of the screen. So this is the the top of the pipe that we're looking at. And so far we're not seeing any obstructions or anything haven't found any joints or breaks. And here you can see what we're coming up to here already. And this is always my trouble spot like i was saying before where i get some roots. And things. And it's like four feet outside of the basement actually let's see what's it say here yeah i'm not even five feet outside of the of the basement. And i can see we're coming up onto some roots already. And i just had this done maybe eight months ago okay. So we've got definitely got some roots already building that'll catch stuff. And eventually starts to plug. And i should be able to force my way through there we go through the roots. And it's just that one spot. So there's there's obviously a separation or a crack. And i'll probably pretty much guarantee that's the transition from the cast iron in my case to the  non-curred pipe. So now we're in the non-crowd we've pushed our way through that bunch of  roots there. And i would suspect we're not going to find any other issues. But let's just have a look as we get out there a little bit you can hear this silly thing like i wish this would just clip on. And off easy because it's kind of a pain see if i can get that off quick get rid of that strap okay. So we'll just keep continuing on down see if we see anything else out of the ordinary. But i don't think we're going to in my case. But you can see how easy it is to feed this cable in. Now that i've got rid of that strap are we coming up to something else here well here's another spot with a bit of weeds in it okay. So we're out  what do we got here i'm at about  four meters. So pretty much 15 to 20 feet out. And i've got another little obstruction there. So i probably should get the guy to come in. And just blast through that stuff while it's going to be really easy to take care of okay we'll continue down kind of just going quickly because there's nothing really to see you know you can kind of inspect your pipe as you're going sometimes if you're in abs or maybe cast iron or whatever you might see where there's a connection. And it's it's disjointed or it's come apart you know. And it's kind of offset things like that you can you can easily see when you're checking it out with the camera i don't have anything like that i've just got some spots for the darn roots come right through. So here we are here there's some kind of a different something different there you can tell there's a transition or a joint maybe in that  in that non-crowd possibly the other thing i'm looking for especially in the non-crowd is where it's squashing down or kind of out of shape. And this could be partly what we're sort of seeing there you're also looking for low spots in the pipe. And when we're running water like this you'll see a low spot by telling that the water has gotten deeper right there. And it's kind of pooling there a little bit. So far i haven't noticed that it's it's been flowing pretty good the whole way not sure what's happening right there you don't want to go out. So far that you drop down into the city sewer because sometimes you get caught up with their connections. And stuff. And you can't get your camera back. Then you've lost the camera everything's looking good we still just have a nice trickle i haven't noticed any pools yet actually right there it's a little bit shallower. So maybe the bottom of the pipe is pushed up just a little bit i've got full lighting on. So it's honestly looking pretty good. And right there we might be what are we coming up on here see what we call for distance 12 meters. So we're at about just about 40 feet. So i'm coming close to being at my city sewer there right. Now so i'm not going to bother going any further i don't want to take the chance of dropping off the end everything looks pretty good except for those couple spots where we've got some definitely got some roots in there. So now when i call my guy to come. And and clean that out with his system i can kind of tell them oh we've got that spot we always have that's just a few feet out of the basement here. And then that other area i think that was at around six meters or something. So he has a bit of an idea where he's going to run into an obstruction. So now because we're using this down this down the sewer it's always a good idea to use some wipes just to kind of clean the cable as you're reeling it back in okay. So normally you can just feed yourself back in i don't normally have it up on this stool. So that might be a little bit of an issue here. But we'll get it  we'll get it feeding back in i'm just cleaning the cable as we go. So it spools all back on there i'm using disinfectant wipes in my case because you just never know where i'm going to use this next once i've used it in a sewer i'd never use it in any kind of drinking water situation obviously. But just in case. But i'm just finding it's wanting to slide off the stool i put it up on here i just put it up higher. So you guys could see what was going on. And it's wanting to slide around there we go. So i'm pulling back out foreign okay there was our one or farther out root spot i just want to see see this what i was saying about one of my dislikes it's hard to find those measurements i've got it marked got the the cable marked here. And even. Then i'm having trouble finding the here it is. So that's at about four meters out i was just curious. So i could tell the guy who's going to do the cleaning where to expect to see that. And we're just about out of there there's the other spot. And the camera is almost up there getting ready to come up the top here there we are we're back in the house okay. So we'll just wipe that off here quick into that camera okay well we got that that all wrapped up hopefully that explained what we had to do. And we'll do our video wrap up,https://youtu.be/Vyklk2SwXEo?t=646,"['What is the purpose of cleaning out a sewer line every year?', 'Why did someone use layers of cardboard soaked in oil as a pipe 50-60 years ago?', 'How does the camera help during a sewer inspection?', 'What are some common issues that can occur with sewer lines?', 'Why is it important to take measurements when inspecting a sewer line?']"

Now generally doors. And windows have very low r ratings okay. And it's because they're thin they're just there's not much you can do to insulate them. So even though it's an insulated door in a lot of cases they have glass or windows there are five right. But the air leaks around the doors that's where you run into trouble if you've got air leaks you've got drafts. And drafts make you feel cold. And when you feel cold you turn up the heat. So if you can get rid of the drafts in your house you can leave the temperature down. And save a ton of money right. So this is really simple it's just a u-channel it clips underneath the door you slide it in this is on the inside of the door because doors always open in on the outside of a house in most cases right. And then you just set the height where it sits nice. And snug. And you can screw it in okay it's all vinyl you just take a pair of snips you can cut it to length no matter what size your door you'll have to cut it to length this is 36. And a half inches long. And i picked it up at the local home depot comes in a couple of different colors. And it has a couple of different runs of different fins here okay. And so if your door is too close to the bottom you're going to rub these things right off. And they become useless right you might find it necessary to make a minor adjustment to your door if you have an old wooden one. But if you have a brand or a relatively new door that was bought in the frame in the jam. Then this will work fine for you if the old one falls off. Now likewise for doors here's another option okay. Now this door sweep will only cover gaps underneath your door up to three quarters of an inch like i said that's standard shouldn't be an issue. But if you have an old door or a wooden door or somebody put a commercial door on your residence i've seen that before you can buy one of these this one goes up to inch. And a half almost i would call it inch. And a quarter. But this is just the same thing it screws on the bottom of the door. And it has a nice thick piece of rubber here that goes much lower. And it'll close up the air gap the idea is to get rid of the draft. And that will work okay as i'm making this video we're going to just clip we're going to just dive into the actual installation show you a couple of tips. And tricks on each part okay. So let's go. And i'll show you how this works if your door gasket is coming off. And you'll see they come installed from the factory they just got these little fins in the bottom right they just snap into place if yours is destroyed okay you can just rip that off the bottom. And then install one of these it's relatively easy to take care of all right we don't need that we can go with this instead. Now all right. Now that's cut the right length. Now so. Now i'm just going to make a mark there we go. And we're going to cut okay here we go nice. And easy all you're gonna need is a drill of some sort. So you can screw this in. So we close the door. And then you make sure you got positive contact okay by sliding the edge down. And then we screw it on piece of cake. And if the gap is too big like i mentioned this one this one can. Then be installed. And it can close the gap all the way down to your trim all right because this one stops here. But this one would go all the way to the trim. So either way they both work the same you can cut this is an aluminum. So you can use your chop saw if you have to cut it down all right or a hacksaw. But i prefer to make a nice clean cut well if you're going to cut these materials i always cut the hinge side. So the factory edge is what everybody else is seeing a little tip do as i say not as i do,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=36,"['What are door sweepers and how do they work?', 'Why are doors and windows considered to have low R ratings?', 'How can air leaks around doors cause drafts?', 'What materials are used for making door sweeps?', 'Can you install a door sweep yourself without professional help?']"

And you just shove them in i know if you have a worn gasket or it's been chewed up from moving furniture or whatever else have you you can go to the local store they're just a couple of bucks each you cut it to fit. And you stick them in. And let's go show you how to do that right. Now all right. So here's how you replace your door gasket you just grab it. And pull it straight out okay that's what it looks like. And when you want to go put the next one in you just cut it to measure. And you start right in the corner nice. And flat. And you just push it [applause]. And now it's getting stuck there here we go done piece of cake. So these are easy to replace. And here's another trick for you you might never have thought about this. But if you're going to go paint your door take the gaskets out. And when you close the door you can put your deadbolt engaged. And it leaves the thickness of this gasket as a gap all around the door. So your paint can dry without getting attached to the frame. And you can go to sleep while it's drying overnight because you're probably going to want to use an oil base which takes 12 hours right just just saying while we're talking about gaskets great painting tip there i'm sure that'll help somebody out the last thing you're going to need for,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=287,"['What is a door gasket?', 'How do I replace a worn-out door gasket?', 'Can I use any material as a replacement for a door gasket?', 'Why should I remove the gasket before painting my door?', 'How long does it take for oil-based paint to dry?']"

Now if you buy a new door generally they come with the door in a little plastic bag. And a lot of people don't know what to do with these things okay they come with a two-sided tape on it. And this gets installed at the base of the door okay i know really it's really tricky. And there's one for each side of the door we'll stick those on right. Now and show you how it's done. So here's our little end pieces here one of the weakest parts of the whole door assembly for installation is right down here okay you want to close that gasket. And stick that in. And it'll seal right to the side of the jam.

And do it on both sides that's it for doors pretty simple right if you've got good seals. And good gaskets. And your lock hardware works right maybe i have to throw an extra screw in there make sure everything's closing snug. So there isn't any air coming through you can easily adjust your latch plate. And close the door a little bit tighter if you need to or you can add one of these if you have to all right. Now this is just a sponge with two-sided tape on it. And this is for windows. And doors which is why we're going to show this we're transitioning from one material to the next. Now right piece of cake. And you can just take this stuff. And put it on your edge of your window close your window if you're old wooden windows this is really handy okay or if your doors don't have a very good seal or they have unique door jamb framing systems from the 1930s. And this is also very handy you just take this extra tape off. And it's only adhesive on one side all right. So be careful with that. But this is a great little gizmo. And you can use this for sealing up just about any door window out there. Now when dealing with windows. And you're dealing with drafts you're dealing with two things one is air moving through the window because they have an operation okay. So they open or close they got a crank. And wind is actually blowing through the window if that's you. And it's an older house a lot of times you can solve that problem you go to the hardware store they're going to sell you the  the plastic kits right you put the two-sided tape on your window casing you put your plastic over top. And you just heat up with a hair dryer that'll stop that air leak. But if your windows are old you're gonna need to take the window trim off first all right. And use the foam gun okay using a foam gun like this. And we've demonstrated this product before i'll throw a link up here about expansion foam. And you can see how this operates. But if you take off your window casings. And foam around the windows all right because chances are if it's an older window it hasn't seen expansion foam it probably just has some fiberglass insulation tucked in. And it doesn't work all right you're gonna have nasty drafts all around your windows it's not coming from the glass necessarily just coming from behind the casing get those sealed up. And then that film that works over the window will work incredibly well all right that's great for older houses,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=408,"['What is the purpose of using two-sided tape on doors and windows?', 'How does the plastic kit work to stop air leaks in old windows?', 'Can you use expansion foam with any type of window trim?', 'Why do old wooden windows benefit from a sponge with two-sided tape?', ""What happens when you don't seal gaps around older windows?""]"

Now the last thing you're going to need especially if you have old wooden windows is you've got to do your caulking on the outside of the house. And the reason why you want to make sure you get this done. Now is because if it gets too cold. Then you've got to spend a lot of money to buy exterior caulking this stuff is only good to be installed i think down about five degrees  if you're in the american scale you're looking at somewhere in the low 50s. And then you got to start upgrading your your quality of caulking in order to deal with the weather. But a good cost-effective polyurethane caulking will seal anything even below water lines okay. So you don't have to worry about ice. And snow. And in freeze thaw situations this stuff works in every environment we use this product on max's shed we did a shed video. And the thing still looks amazing. And it's been a year. And a half. Now so this is how i know it works really well. Now if you have windows that have bad caulking joints you want to get those sealed up okay no ifs ands or butts. And i'm going to go a little demonstration here of how to seal it up i just took a little bit of wood here. And put it together because whenever you're cocking you're dealing with a joint right don't grab it. And push it because that makes a heck of a mess right. Now i have told people before. And i've worn them this stuff is really difficult to work with. So when you're working with caulking you want to be pulling it towards you all right. And you want to be pretty much almost on a 90 degree angle. And you want your tip cut on a 45. So what you're doing putting just enough pressure. So it fills the shape of the tube that has been cut over that angle okay if you go too fast you're going to make a mess. So keep it slow. And you can just keep an eye on the bead right in front of it if it's squirting out just a bit. Then you know you've got good speed you do not want to tool or use your finger on this stuff because it's incredibly nasty to work with. And real quick before we get on to some more interesting things in dealing with water management all the other systems of the house one more air draft issue you can address especially in older homes okay there's a lot of air coming into the house around your outlet plates. And you can buy one of these little packages. And these are kind of fun because it's like punch-outs right. So if you have the old-style receptacle you can peel out just the part that goes around the old style receptacle okay or you can have the new modern decora the square parts. And you can just create that little it's. So adorable it's kind of fun to work with. Now you can also pull out the area where the set screw goes okay there you go. So you take off your wall plate. And then you put this over top of your plug all right. And you screw your wall plate back in those holes are where the wall plate gets screwed in by the way okay nice. And simple even the middle of the old fashioned receptacle style it has that little hole punch out for it. Now this seems a little ridiculous it's only a few bucks. But in the same way that we're dealing with sound. And sound transmission you want to stop the air from passing through trust me older houses a lot of those exterior wall cavities especially on the old red brick right they don't have any insulation on the wall. And so the wind's just blowing through there like crazy get yourself these silly little foam things. And they will help change your life get rid of your drafts. And you will not have to turn up the heat in order to survive the winter,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=548,"['What is caulking used for?', 'How does polyurethane caulking work?', 'Why is it difficult to work with caulking?', 'What are air draft issues in older homes?', 'How do foam sealants help with drafts?']"

Now the next thing that i'm going to recommend is all about water diversion okay on the outside of the house you have eave straps. And i've got this neat little gizmo here okay. And this is just a an extension for your downspout all right. And they snap together because there we go all right. And they're structural they've got a little wedge in the middle okay. And so this goes outside attaches to your downspout okay lift it up to where it's engaged you can even go online on amazon you can get extensions for these things you can run them many many feet from the house if you need the point of this is you can install this. And then you can backfill with gravel. And dirt or stone or whatever it's doing decorative in your house. And it looks like your eaves troughs. And your downspouts go right underneath the ground. So we're going to go outside right. Now i'm going to demonstrate because i got my p gravel delivered i'm going to show you how we're going to finish off our house all right this is how we're finishing off our house pea gravel. So my downspout is going to be covered in this stuff right here. And then thanks thanks to all this covered mess i'm actually getting my my downspouts. And my eavesdrop installed in the spring. But this is flexible. So they'll bring it to that area they can connect it throw in a couple of screws this enables me to have a nice pretty finish on there. And it's pretty unassuming isn't it. And because it's emptying out on stone it'll drain just fine. But then it's not ugly. And you can stand on it. And not damage it amazing you gotta love it. So this gives me water diversion that's guaranteed to get away from the house i'm never gonna get kicked off by accident because it's buried in the stone. Now before we deal with plumbing yes. And it is a major issue every year i'm going to give some of the best advice. So that you can avoid having a flood in your house we're going to talk about a couple other things insulation we  just released our installation video a few days ago i want you to check it out it's for blowing in insulation on your own okay. Now the machine that you get from the home depot it's free if you buy a whole bunch of the stuff. But unless you're insulating your whole house you probably are going to end up buying it it's about 100 rental. And then it's 60 bucks a bag it's this stuff,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=763,"['What is the purpose of eave straps and downspout extensions?', 'How do downspout extensions work with water diversion?', 'Why is insulation important for preventing floods in houses?', 'Can downspout extensions be used to divert water from other areas?', 'What are some benefits of using pea gravel as a backfill material?']"

And then it's 60 bucks a bag it's this stuff each one of these bags does about 100 square feet if you add another r20 on top what's there. Now now a lot of homes especially older ones have  just a little bit of loose fill or they might have bad insulation. And bat insulation. And attic is bad insulation because it doesn't fill the voids. And the cavities it doesn't trickle down where the roof line is leaves a lot of really cold spots okay. So watch that video. And you're going to learn all about how to do blown in insulation on your own because it's relatively cheap. And easy. And it can save you a ton of money on heating costs all right you might only need a top dress a little bit. But go ahead up in your attic measure how thick your insulation is. Now because over time as it settles okay you lose r value it really has to do with the thickness that's left not how much they started with. So a lot of the old fibers. And fills. And cellulose humidity hits it in the summertime. And it compresses. And it compresses. And you're left with something instead of an r20 or an r30 that you thought you had you might only have an r10 all right. And so you could be losing a ton of money by having all the heat in your house just lifting right through your attic. And if you live in the south. And you're watching this video this is a great idea for you too because this might help keep your house cool all right be sure to check it's worth taking a quick peek up the ladder.

And i like to deal with it as a system okay it's time to turn off the water outside okay on the day that you pick to turn off the water to the hose bibs outside you should do a bunch of different things one check all your fire detectors if they're battery operated change the batteries don't just check to see if they beep okay it's not worth it for you to leave a battery in there that's only going to last for two months because the change in your if you're checking it on october. And then you get a christmas day fire. And your battery's dead that's the wrong time to find out you shouldn't have saved that four bucks you go get yourself a new battery change your batteries don't just test them please it's that simple go buy two of them one for every detector that you need just i want to harp on you. But those are kind of fire accidents are needless every year there's always a story of somebody who suffers a tragic loss because they're too cheap to buy a battery right don't be that guy next you have a furnace in your house if you live in the wintertime you have to turn off a hose bib because we only turn it off where it's cold if you live in miami you don't care. But for us up here up the north we to turn this off. And manage that water you also are going to have something going on with the furnace. And that's your humidity all right you're going to have a some kind of humidifier in most cases attached to a furnace it's a little box that's about this big has a hose flexible duct line usually that goes into the plenum. And so what happens is as the air is blowing through you turn that on. And you turn on the water supply to that. And you have to move a valve in a lot of cases from summer to winter okay. So go check it out make sure you're you're adding moisture to the air that you're adding into your house if you're heating your house you're not adding any humidity all of your building materials like your crown moldings. And your flooring cabinets everything will shrink that's made of wood okay or mdf for that matter. And you'll start getting gaps. And cracks. And that's just a disaster because what happens is. Then dirt gets in all those gaps. And cracks. And then the summer comes everything swells again. But now there's dirt in the way. So then things start getting warped. And messed up. So manage the immunity in your house. And save yourself money long term you should also have a little list in your drawer okay of all of the stuff that you do semi-annually all right there's always maintenance on every system in your house great day to go. And check that out twice a year you should do a walk of your property check all your grading check all of your roof check all your eaves troughs make sure they're cleaned out make sure your shingles are in good shape all that kind of stuff right if you just dedicate one day to all those different little systems making sure everything's intact. And everything's attached properly there's nothing flapping around in the wind. Then you can avoid disaster long term. Now let's get into this enough preaching hose bibs one of the most misunderstood pieces of plumbing in the entire house okay,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=999,"['What is the recommended practice for checking fire detector batteries?', 'Why is it important to change fire detector batteries regularly?', 'How often should you check and maintain your humidifier?', 'What are some common issues that can occur if humidity levels are not managed properly in a home?', 'What is the purpose of having a list of maintenance tasks for semi-annual checks?']"

So what i'm going to do today is i'm going to discuss the basic system how it should be installed. And the different things that can happen if they're installed improperly okay. And what you can do to help avoid having a flood in your home. Now this is a 12 inch hose bib i think it's 12 yeah 12 says. So right there all right. Now if you haven't seen this before this represents the outside of the house okay it has two little slots there. So you can screw it to something in a lot of cases these are installed on the rim joist. And the plumber would have come along. And drilled a hole big enough that this big nut fits through that hole okay. So it's usually like a one inch hole one. And a quarter. So that means the hole is bigger than the pipe. And then he throws a couple of screws in to hold it steady okay. Now there's this washer here. Now if you see this washer let's get this up close okay  close up on the washer it's actually a wedge it's skinnier at the bottom that is at the top when you install it make sure it snaps in the right way okay. So it's skinnier at the bottom than it is at the top because what this does is when you tighten these screws it goes like it goes like this right. And you get a little bit of a degree a one degree angle that's what the wedge is for okay you screw it to your house. And it should give you one degree angle. And this is why in the winter time what we want to do with this faucet is we want to close this is already closed right you're going to go inside in your ceiling somewhere there's going to be a valve like this. And it's going to be a shut off valve every house that has a hose bib has a shut off valve for each of these hose bibs it's usually a quarter turn. And it's usually a ball valve like this these are rather expensive these valves don't have any gaskets they never wear out. And they never leak when they're closed they're closed end of the discussion no water gets through there you close this usually have a trap door on your ceiling okay or some sort of access point you close it. And then this bleeder valve you open up. And it drips okay what you do from outside open up the handle okay. And now that the pressure has been shut off inside the house water that's in this when it's installed right will drain out of the faucet. And leave this empty when this cylinder is empty you're safe okay. And here's why let's just show you how this works because a lot of people think that it turns the water off here here's the rod. And there's the gasket it shuts the water off in here okay this is the outside of the house it's an inch. And a half of wood. Then you've got this cavity. And it's supposed to be filled with insulation wrapped around that pipe okay r20 is standard. And then on the other side of the installation there's a vapor barrier. And the other side of that is where this connection. And this shutoff valve are okay this valve is inside the heated heated part of the house where there's plastic. And that part never freezes okay that's where the water is stopped it stays warm all year round. Now inside this pipe here it gets really really cold. But this steel does not expand. And blow up if it's empty. And now we're going to explain why everybody has floods in their basement somebody was installing this one ah that's in the way they screwed it flat okay. And they open this up. And some of the water comes out. But some of it stays in the back because maybe they drilled the hole into the house on an angle. And they went through two pieces of wood if yours is installed like this. And you open this up. And you let it drain you're letting half of the water out. And you think oh i've done my job okay i don't know it's kind of freaky you actually want to go in your basement. And grab this thing from the inside. And see if it moves around if it moves around lift it up tighten it again from the outside make sure it's got a slope okay if it's like this you have to have a valve that has the bleeder on it because. Now this bleeder valve is on your side okay the water is stopped right here on the handle in the middle this represents access to water that can be trapped in here all right. So if you have water trapped in there you can open this up. And it'll leak out inside the house. Now you can just throw in a little container or something catch the water it's only a few ounces okay it's not going to create a flood it's just whatever's being trapped in there that you can release on that valve all right. Now here's what happens if you have your shutout valve. And you ignore this in the wintertime. And it's full of water okay even if you close the handle that's great okay. Now it's closed. And so many people think oh i closed the handle i'm good to go. But they're installed wrong they got the wrong slope it's holding water. And way back here somewhere where the water level is we go that represents your water line okay it's sitting right here all of this is full of water what happens in the winter time is this pipe is not designed to expand. And the water will that water will freeze okay. And become a solid block of ice. And then when it gets below minus five it starts to grow yeah water freezes. And then it expands when it gets really cold the colder the winter the more that expands. And this will split open. So fast it'll blow your mind these pipes are not designed to resist the expansion of the ice okay they'll blow up. Now where is that where's that damage gonna happen where's my water line right here it's gonna happen back here somewhere usually top or bottom side doesn't make a difference because this is the part,https://youtu.be/3FG0K9LpkXU?t=1183,"['What is the typical installation location for a 12-inch hose bib?', 'How does a wedge washer function in a hose bib installation?', 'What is the purpose of a shut-off valve and bleeder valve in a hose bib system?', 'Why do many people think that closing the handle on a shut-off valve turns off the water supply?', 'What happens when a pipe expands due to freezing temperatures?']"

So if you're looking at this as far as your wall assembly is concerned okay here i'm just going to draw this out. So maybe this will make a little bit more sense to people okay here's your here's your your rim joist right. And then there's usually some concrete or whatever right. And then here let's say there's a wall. And someone will frame a wall. And this will all be insulation. But look where the blow up happens right in the same spot as your insulation. And here's your outside frame okay. So what ends up happening is all this water you open this you open this up as soon as the spring comes. And now you're opening up back here. And all the water is entering the pipe for the first time in four to six months it goes right out of that hole straight inside the wall cavity in the insulation. And it's hidden in behind the wall you don't see it until it fills up the wall cavity soaks the floor you're out there gardening. And watering your plants. And having a nice sunny day for the first time in months. And this sucker blows up on you. And if no one's in the basement to realize it it can be hours before you fix that situation because you're outside working right it's spring. And this is what happens people every year they blow up because they were installed on an angle all right they don't have a bleeder valve. And they think they're safe because they've got a frost free pipe. And they closed up before the winter don't be a victim make sure that yours is angled the right direction. And if it's in the wrong direction change your valve where your shutoff is. And put a bleeder on it okay that is a correct assembly all right. So if you're a new homeowner or a first time homeowner or you've moved to a new region you're not used to winter climates that information is going to save your bacon okay. Now yes this kind of accident when it happens most insurance companies cover the damage. But do you really want to have to make an insurance claim.

Now that you're working on because 120 volts yep it can kill you to install a four-way switch you need to install it between two 3-way switches just like this. And you know what why don't you go watch my 3-way switch video right. Now i'll wait here until you get back okay you're back i've been wondering where you were i'm sure. Now you have a complete understanding of how to connect these two 3-way switches remember in that video that this cable this white cable it's got this inside of it it's got this red wire a black wire the copper ground wire. And the white neutral wire well guess what those wires just feed right through the four-way switch it's that simple this is the mysterious four-way switch you already understand what a three-way switch looks like it's got three screws plus the special green grounding screw we'll check this one out this one's got four two at the top two at the bottom plus the green grounding screw the thing you must understand. So that you can install a four we switch the right way is it must be installed in between two 3-way switches. So we're going to put ours right here you can't put the four-way switch on the front side or on the back side of the circuit it will not work for this to make a little bit more sense i'm going to number the boxes this first three-way switch let's call it box number one the box where the four-way switch is going to be will be box number two. And this final box where the last three-way switch is is box number three i need to cut the white cable right in the middle. So we can actually make two separate cables that will feed down into box number two oh that's nice that will pass inspection look what we've got we've got the cable coming from box number one here to box number two. And we've got the same type cable going from box number two over to box number three we all we have to do to hook up the four-way switch is strip the insulation,https://youtu.be/Wknz-Beb268?t=34,"['What are the necessary precautions when working with 120-volt circuits?', 'Can a four-way switch be installed on any circuit?', 'How does a four-way switch differ from a three-way switch in terms of its configuration?', 'Why must a four-way switch be installed between two three-way switches?', 'What happens if a four-way switch is not installed correctly?']"

And we're going to be ready to go remember when we started this four-way switch video we had a cable out like this red black copper white check it out red black copper white wire. And we've got the other cable going from box two to box 3 that also has the red black copper white wires all we have to do to make the four-way switch work is wire nut the two white wires together take the two copper wires wire them together with a little tail piece for that ground screw. And then we're just left with the black. And red wires do you think those people are back yet from watching that three-way switch video. Now let's keep moving forward i can't wait for them look what we have five wires left one two three four five. And we've got five screws on the four-way switch we just have to connect them to the right location. And everything is going to work perfectly we're just about finished. But here's where people make a mistake if you take the two wires that are coming from box number one. And install one of them on a brass screw. And the other one on a black screw it's not going to work you need to install one wire on each of the brass screws it doesn't matter which color goes on which brass screw. Then you take the two wires that are going to box number three.

And basically what it is is it's a treatment that's added to lumber to make it more moisture. And mold resistance resistant i mean. And it also has some fire resistant to it as well. So you as you can see i mean these these were just normal 2x4s at one point they've been  completely covered in the blue wood or in the sorry in the blue stain or the blue product  here's a small piece you know just for demonstration  it's easier to hang on to this. But so you can see it's totally encapsulated i purposely made a bit of a notch here. And showing you that  when you cut it it's not blue on on the inside it is at this end. So that's a factory end there. But anywhere where you cut it drill it that sort of thing what you want to do is actually retreat it with the product. So they they sell it in these spray bottles  they do have it in 5 gallon pales  what i've done is i found it to work quite well i just buy a couple of these spray bottles. And i've bought just a cheap plastic container put a a shallow sponge inside of that container. And i've dumped some of the product in there. So that  you know when i get all my studs or whatever i'm doing cut to length i've always got at least one cut end i have this container on the floor. And i just simply walk over press that down into the sponge. And it  treats the end of my my cut end again works really well it's  no mess at all everything's contained in this one con container i throw the lid back on at night or when i'm not using it. And it's good to go. So that works really well. Now on spot like this where you've got a notch or you know maybe you've drilled a hole or something through it that's where the spray bottle comes in. So you can just simply you know this is wherever on the wall or wherever it is just give it a bit of a spray make sure you get a good soaking on that. And it's all treated. And we're good to go. So that's one of the main things to remember with this is just make sure any of the cuts or any of the spots that you've  made bare that you retreat it. And you're good to go. So i just thought  to show you a quick demonstration on using this product. And making sure that you do retreat it. So once again it's shanana from house improvements. And you can check out we have many other videos some of them using this product on on our youtube channel. And also if you go to the website at host improvements.com we've got articles there on many different  do-it-yourselfer type projects. And ideas. And a forum there as well for do-it-yourselfers.

And today i'm just going to give you a really quick video because we've had some questions in another video that we posted a while back  where we used some basement subfloor we showed how to install these types of products  we've had a lot of interest on how much difference it actually makes you know temperature- wise that sort of thing comfort level. So we just thought we'd  show a little bit of comparison here. And we've also compared a couple different types of products one product on this side is the osb with a foam  i don't know maybe about a/ inch of foam attached right to the back the other square over there osb again. But it's got more of a plastic just kind of an a creating  structure on the back that raises the board up off the concrete. So we were actually surprised before we started shooting the video we just you know wanted to see for ourselves these panels have been sitting here for about three 3 days or. So just kind of climatizing to the room. And that. And we we came in ahead of time here just to see what difference there was. And we were quite surprised we thought we would see a difference in temperature between the surface of the two panels because this one here has an actual whole  layer of styrofoam in the back that one doesn't. And really with the accuracy of the tools we have there was basically no difference  you know .1 de celsius sort of thing maybe it's a little hard to tell cu these fluctuate a bit. So i i'm going to call it no difference between the two products  as scientific as we can be with our study  there's definitely a difference of  about a degree or. So or even maybe just a hair more from the actual bare concrete to the surface of these products. So so they do to answer part of the questions we were looking for they do make a difference surface temperature- wise as opposed to having your flooring right on bare concrete to being on here  when i shoot this. And we're going to show you with the thermal imaging camera here in a minute. But i i just want to shoot this here. So now the temp the numbers don't really mean anything completely. But i'm getting an average of about 19.1 on this panel. And out here yeah 19.0. So like i said we're getting about a 0.1 difference which i pretty much would say is nothing as far as any kind of value. Now what we are getting. So we had the 19.1 there when i come over here right there i've got about 16.7 on the bare concrete compared to the 19.1. So we've got a pretty significant difference there. And i'm just going to try that again just to see just to kind of get an average yeah 19.0 16 7ish. So you know there there definitely is a difference there  with these two products in fact i'm not even 100% sure. But it might even be the same manufacturer for these ones  they're charging in our area about a dollar difference like from that panel to this panel. So in my opinion it's not worth the dollar because i'm not seeing a difference between those two products  where i am seeing the difference is is from this surface of this product to the actual surface that you're covering. So so that's where i see the product. So let's let's switch to thermal imaging camera. And just have a look  because that's kind of interesting to,https://youtu.be/fB4ko39UJbo?t=0,"['What type of products were compared in the video?', 'How much difference did the temperature make between the two products?', 'Why was the study conducted?', 'What is the approximate dollar difference between the two products?', 'Is there any noticeable difference between the surface of the product and the bare concrete?']"

And just have a look  because that's kind of interesting to see okay. So you can see. Now with the thermal imaging camera you can see the quite clearly the two panels sitting there  the temperature that you can see in the center of the screen at the little pointer cursor is the approximate temperature again i don't know this exact camera has real ac  huge accuracy. But you can basically see that you know we've got you know 20 1 to 20° or something like that approximately between the two panels. But then when you skip off to the side here you can see where it definitely drops you know almost 2° c. And you can even see it in the coloration in the in the viewer in fact if we go all the way to left you can see where i was actually kneeling before you can see the the color difference there in my spots okay. So anyways that's the thermal imaging you can see a definite difference there. And obviously as we get closer to the outside wall it's the floor is going to get colder that only stands the reason  it's winter time right. Now where we're shooting this. So and as we move in the floor is going to get a little warmer. But direct comparison side by side concrete to wood there is a defin definite difference in  temperature okay. So i just want to show,https://youtu.be/fB4ko39UJbo?t=222,"['What type of camera is being used for thermal imaging?', 'How accurate is the thermal imaging camera?', 'Can you see any differences in temperature between materials like concrete and wood?', 'Why does the floor get colder as you move towards an outside wall?', 'Does the material of the surface affect the temperature reading?']"

So i just want to show you quickly here to wrap things up what i was talking about on the bottom of these panels. So you can see you can see here this one's just kind of a plastic  covering that raises the wood itself up off of the  the floor helps provide a little bit of air flow possibly. And a little bit of drainage if if your concrete floor possibly is a bit wet some older basements definitely are this one's just solid  styrofoam insulation. And i didn't actually measure it. But i'm going to guess that that is probably close to  maybe half an inch maybe 5/8 of an inch i'm not sure can you see that you want it closer  one of the other differences between the two there's about a/4 in difference in total thickness this one's thicker than this one is. So if that's a you know a difference that you need to consider in your basement  there's there's one other thing to think about this is the type of panel we used in our other installation video we didn't use this one. But i said before just because all the questions we got we wanted to actually see if there was a difference. And if this one was worth the extra money my opinion it isn't  okay i think we can wrap it up. So that was just well we intended it to be really quick i don't know what it ended up being.

So we have shut off valves under the sink nice. And simple. Now these ones are not quarter turn valve they are the style of valve that have gaskets on them. And then this house is really ancient.

So we're going to go downstairs. And turn off the main water supply because these old valves if the gaskets are bad they'll end up leaking.

So what we're going to end up having to do is we're going to have to cut down through the gable side of this cabinet here. So that we have enough room to get the sink in it won't be exactly on center. But it'll only be off about a/ quarter inch should be pretty invisible. So because we have to do that remove this we're going to be cutting the countertop best to just get rid of the doors this is a nice quick system little pin in the back pop them off. So the way you take these braided faucet lines off really simple it's a 38 fitting you put your wrench on. And you just start loosening it. And if there's a little bit of slack once you get it loosened up a bit you can usually do it with your fingers these aren't really difficult to attach. And traditionally it's just a little bit of a gasket in there. So the reason you need a wrench is when you do it fingertight to install take it. And give it another half turn that's usually how you set it okay. So this is never fun. But you're really can't do this blind. So it's always good to get right in here it's kind of like going for a trip in an mri machine here we go it's a single faucet. And they have just this little threaded piece here to hold that in on the other side i've got my pull out hose. And these are just finger tightened of course with time you get a little bit of water getting underneath. And then the particle board on the countertop swells that's more than fingertight after a while. So that's good i'm glad we got that off without too much of a fight disconnect this hose. So that it will come up through the hole we got lucky today because this one's plastic. And not metal. So i'm all for keeping my life simple. So now we're just going to take it apart in the reverse order of when it was installed. So we're just going to pull out the hose. And pull that faucet out. Now this is always going to be nasty underneath i've never seen this look good almost need a crowbar to pull that out that's ridiculous the way things are done around this house makes you wonder i'm playing it safe i'm going to wear some gloves for the rest of this plumbing once you've pulled out the faucet all we,https://youtu.be/HLi0ZVJKzYM?t=63,"['What is the reason for cutting down the gable side of the cabinet?', 'How do you remove a braided faucet line?', 'Why is a wrench necessary when installing a braided faucet?', 'What happens to the particle board on the countertop over time?', 'What is the recommended method for disassembling a plumbing fixture?']"

And this clip sits in the saddle here. And when you tighten the screw it goes up. And so it creates that reverse compression pulls the sink down. So there's usually you know 6 8 maybe 10 depending how aggressive the installer [music] is just double check reach around make sure everything's good we're not connected to the counter anymore. But we are connected to the plumbing. So we have two options  you can undo the collar right here if you're going with the same kind. And this is really simple you have two connections here. So this brass ring here connects the drain with a tail piece. And this plastic one here compresses the tail piece onto the abs usually with a gasket. So we can take our wrench. And we can put it on here. And we can rip this off usually comes off pretty simple. So if you have the ability to reuse your plumbing later this is a great technique they just separate like that. And then just give it a pop. And out she goes here's the original rubber gasket this is the plaster ste seene that they send you. And you stretch it out around the underside of the sink. And then you put it down the compression on those clips is supposed to hold that into place to keep moisture from getting underneath you can see how effective it is it doing that i mean it's not that's why when i'm installing my sinks i like to always make my own gasket out of plumbers putty because you can always use more than you need. And let it get compressed out of the gap. And then clean that up afterwards. So as a contractor i'm always on the look out for a good deal  i have a lot of suppliers that have a discontinued product or return product or just they've changed their stock. And so they're no longer selling something or they get a manufacturer bait. And they're passing the deal on to us. So i have this horrible habit of buying things that i don't need anticipating that someday i'll be able to use it. And when i saw this sink i fell in love. And whether i was putting this in a client's home or in my own home someday down the road i didn't care this is a colar cast iron sink this sucker here is worth a lot of money. And i think i picked this up for 50 bucks great deal. So when i got the phone call to do this job i'm like i got the sink for you cuz i saw the cream color tile it's not the greatest. But i think this sink is going to pop. And have. So much character you'll forget the condition of the rest of this kitchen. So the downside of buying things that discontinued or whatever is they don't always have all the parts in this case i don't have the template obviously somebody bought this sink special order this color isn't a standard it's a bone color they went to go install it took out the template realized they had a problem brought the sink back. So what i got to do is i got to cut a hole in my existing countertop. And into my cabinet that will allow this to be installed without a template. So i have to. Now make my own template we're going to go 31. And 1/4 in wide 19 1/2 deep. So before we get twoo carried away. And start cutting holes. Now that we have our measurements we want to pull out our faucet. And just confirm that this faucet. And this sink are going to work together in harmony my hope is is that i can cut the hole.

So thin you'll see on here on the faucet that once it's installed this nut only leaves. So much space. But because it's a cast iron. And it's a thick sink that allows me to go right onto it. So i don't have to drill holes after the fact i just saved the step because i took two seconds to find out if that's going to work awesome. So we've taken our measurements of our sink we've re reduced that number for the overhang marked it with a pencil,https://youtu.be/HLi0ZVJKzYM?t=424,"['Can you cut through a cast iron sink?', 'Will attaching a faucet to a sink affect its structural integrity?', 'What is the typical steel gauge thickness for faucets?', 'How do you determine if a faucet will fit on a specific sink?', 'What are some common problems that can occur during partial installations?']"

And now we're just laying some tape out on the countertop. So that visually i can see it you can maybe see the pencil line in the sun. But when i start cutting with my jigsaw. And i get sawdust flying everywhere going to be really hard pressed to know where my line is this line here represents where i'm cutting i'm also going to cut right against the back wall you can see this is a much bigger sink. So we're not relying on any of the structural components of this cabinet to hold that sink in from the front or the rear. And most likely we're going to have to to take the whole front support right out before we even bother starting it's going to be the gable support of each of the side cabinets that's going to be carrying the weight direct load transfer just like structure it'll support itself from side to side without any difficulty at all. So before we can remove this piece of cabinet from the countertop just good to know they installed the countertop to the cabinet with these little 1. And a/4 inch screws you could buy a blade specific for famica countertops not really necessary here because we have a/ in overlay you'll find that the chipping that happens with this blade is. So minuscule it's not even 302 of an inch it's irrelevant to our situation i don't use the tape to keep it from chipping that's a w wives tail if you have to rely on tape to keep something from breaking  you already made the mistake you know what does work if you use tape on plaster before you put a nail in it that works it's the only time tape is in it good to you man [music] there we go we just got to trim up a little bit of the particle board in the back corners here  grab my fine multi-tool it's just like a vibration cutting tool if you don't have one of these bad boys that's fine you can always just use a hammer. And a chisel you'll get the same result this is just a lot cooler. So now we've got the hole set for our sink the the sink is  it's only got a/ inch gap on the front. So we got it cut pretty tight here. But in the back there's like about a three. And a half in space which is awesome cuz that's where the faucet's going to go. So i just traced out the line for where the sink is going to go the the idea here is we're going to cut through the gable. And then we're going to shim underneath between the sink. And the gable. So that there's a direct load transfer. So we're not putting all the weight on the countertop. So now we just going to roll this in. And make sure she's going to fit all right perfect. So now the next step. Now that we have our sink in place  we're,https://youtu.be/HLi0ZVJKzYM?t=503,"['What type of screws were used to install the countertop to the cabinet?', 'How does the author recommend preventing chipping when cutting through a specific material?', 'What is the purpose of using tape on plaster before drilling into it?', 'Can you use a vibration cutting tool or a hammer and chisel as an alternative?', 'Why is it necessary to shim underneath the sink and gable for direct load transfer?']"

So now the next step. Now that we have our sink in place  we're going to attach our faucet our drain all that kind of stuff this particular sink doesn't need a gasket it is just too heavy. And too flat. And it doesn't have a cavity for the gasket to sit in. So if you want to seal around this the only thing you can use is a little bit of cured clear silicone let's go when you're tightening this up you don't want to go as you know full full tight right away especially if you're working alone if you have someone working with you like a cameraman you could reach over. And hold it in position while you tighten it otherwise finger tighten.

And that'll be nice you want me to hold it no i'm good there we go just take your pliers what i want to do is i just separate them a little bit there's tabs on that you can turn with. But if you have a little bit of torque with a pair of pliers you can really get it tight. So you don't ever want this coming loose once you got the rest of your plumbing put together always want to test to make sure you got it on there tight enough okay yeah those taps aren't going to move yep. So this particular faucet it has a threaded assembly. And it has a gasket ring inside here. So we're just going to seat this in. And push down on this part. Now the gasket assembly is inside nice. And strong there we're going to just make sure we're not cross threaded we're going to tighten this c on here. And that'll hold it all in place doesn't matter how tight you turn this it won't affect the ability for the faucet to move. So feel free to make sure it's nice. And snug one more thing we're since we're out in the country. And we have well water here it's a little hard.

And i'm going to take off off this extra bit of screen how many screens does a tap need. Now that the screens are gone we won't have a problem with the faucet bunging up you won't have as much ation. But i'd rather have a faucet that works. So here we are with our sink components we've got our basket strainers have to take off our nut have a nice little gasket here i call it the top hat gasket just. So i can differentiate between that. And no regular overing. Now i am not a license plumber i've just installed a bazillion of these things. So okay. And then we just go back where we just were. And put all that back together again. So the assembly simple you take your ring you put your brass extension in there. And then you drop in your washer no past glues otherwise necessary. So once we've locked these in place we'll be good. Now this is inch. And 1 half pipe. And this is an inch. And 1/2 hole in the kitchen your f your your strains are always inch. And a half hole the exact same piece they make it for bathroom sinks. And it's inch. And a quarter do not get the wrong one that's a drive back to the store you're going to regret slide that on. So it's important that once you have everything fingertight take the wrench. And you really want to tighten the basket nut here if it's moving around just put your hand in the top put a little bit of compression resistance there there we go all right this will get us our measurements we just adjust these what we're looking to measure we measure from the inside to where you want the pipe to finish we're looking at a n. And a half inch pipe that's comfortable all right. So we're going to go. And cut that first we're going to cut a one inch piece for here. So we can stick these together. And send our water back towards the back corner in this particular application there is no p trap it's actually in the basement downstairs which is great because it gives you a little extra storage you can keep your garbage. And recycling under the sink that way a little old school love to sand up my ends a little bit get rid of my burs rough up my fittings i just like to believe that that might just make things stick a little bit better i happen to be aware that there's two kinds of abs out there one of the building store that i was at today to pick these fittings up doesn't carry the kind that i like to use my plumbing supply store is closed. And it's a saturday. So i got stuck using this stuff. And i know that if you don't rough it up it just does not hold very. Then time to grab the glue using the yellow abs glue here. And i'm going to grab a cloth this stuff can make a mess. So respect people's property in their cabinets what we're going to do actually is just glue these in first get these prepped up loosen the collar slide that into position slide that one into position. And this is really how simple this is run your glue. And then turn these in together tighten the collars leave a bit of a slope hand tight. And then a quarter that's it. So what i'm going to do here.

So one of the most complicated doors that you can install in your home of course is the french door which simply means two doors right beside each other with nothing in between them shouldn't be that difficult thing the secret here is in planning having your house framed properly having the jams cut properly. And especially in a basement because your floor is never level there's a lot of information to go through. So we're gonna go step by step on this installation process to make sure that if you want to have a gorgeous french door you can do it yourself. And have an amazing look we're even going to throw in a couple of ball latches at the top. So that there aren't things stays shut okay. So building a french door step by step let's go through the tutorial right basically you go to this harbor store you buy yourself a kit. And it is going to come with a jam for each side with the hinges already in there. And it's going to come with the jam top piece it's your job to make sure that you frame the door properly. So that this will fit this one does not. So we will have to cut it down no big surprise we took over this job from a homeowner who. Then sold this house. And left this mess to somebody else. So this hole does not fit a french door. But that's fine we're just gonna cut it down in the jamb. And install. Now listen if you're installing one of these. And you have yet to buy a laser level do yourself a favor. And go out. And buy one if we're in a basement right. Now so we don't have any confidence that this is plumb level square or otherwise. So we're gonna have to basically build this door float it in the space. And then attach it all or first we're going to cut this down. So it fits [applause]. So the first thing you're gonna do when you want to put in a door especially in a basement although you should do this with the main floor - just in case there's some settling a lot of wood construction homes floor choices take a little weight. And then they drove do a little droop you know.

So what we want to do is take this piece here that is shorter we want to take the extra eighth of an inch off one side look we're hinging out this side is shorter. So we're gonna take another eighth of an inch off the bottom. So that we can just come in. And install our jamb pre-made. And thick it in the hole. And then all we have to do after that is just make sure that each side is plumb. And square at the top. So let's get this the right height first here we go that's the name. So there are three key measurements you're gonna need here one is you have to adjust from your laser,https://youtu.be/dVr03Y6f8wM?t=173,"['What type of measurement do you need to take for this project?', 'How much will the jamb pre-made be thick?', 'Why is it necessary to ensure each side is plumb and square at the top?', 'What is the purpose of taking an eighth of an inch off one side and the bottom?', 'How does adjusting from your laser help with the project?']"

Now the laser line to the top is gonna be exactly the same on both sides good the next thing we've got to do is cut the piece that goes across. So to make our life simple we will simply measure the width of this we got that 50 inches we're gonna cut this to 50 inches. And that's the next measurement we're gonna need. And then after that it's just a matter of figuring out where the jamb assembly gets attached to that top jamb. And then we can stick it in. So here we go that's pretty snug. But that's fine it's not going anywhere i think i like it. So that's our head reestablish we have our sides established. But now we have to figure out you know how plumb are these walls. So we're gonna set up our laser level. And throw a line up each of these to see if this framing is made a little square or not okay. So when i throw my line up i'm going to start right here off the wood i'm gonna see that it opens up a little bit okay. So that's in the world of framing that's actually pretty straight it's not a big issue okay we should just double check this side as well that's give or take an eighth at the corner that's actually pretty straight too okay. So all things being equal let's assume that these are relatively plumb. And our hole is 50 inch that means it should be about 50 inch at the bottom as well we'll just confirm that yeah that's a little bit less okay all right. So now it's time for some math okay. So we have a 50 inch hole. And we got to check our doors. Now i've already measured an advance. And double-checked these particular doors are completely square they're solid wood they do not have a built in bevel okay some doors come with a built in bevel. And make it really easy for opening. And closing in tight spaces these do not. So we have to take our 24 inches per door we have to add an extra eighth of an inch just. So that they can open. And close properly without contacting each other in the middle plus you want another eighth on each side that's the quarter. And we put all of that together plus the thickness of the jamb material that looks like a half-inch to me. So 48 49 hmm that is 2 h 3 eighths 49. And 3/8 which leaves us 5/8 leftover wow. So when we install our jam we're gonna have just enough space in here to throw in the occasional shim. But not a whole heck of a lot more than that. So what i'm going to suggest is when we stand it up into position we get as close to the edge as we can on one side. So what we're gonna do is we're going to install that jam with just 1/8 inside that corner. And then we're going to measure across our 49. And 3/8. And then put the other jam in,https://youtu.be/dVr03Y6f8wM?t=206,"['What is the purpose of adjusting the laser line to the floor?', 'How do you determine if a wall is plumb?', 'What is the significance of adding an extra eighth of an inch to each door?', 'Why is it necessary to leave 5/8 of space for shims in the jamb assembly?', 'What is the recommended method for installing the jam with the top and bottom jams?']"

And 3/8. And then put the other jam in. And we're gonna attach it using the brad nailer. And just throw a few nails in on an angle we're intentionally nailing it. So these nails come back out the other side. So please do be careful on your hands. Now our gap was 49. And 3/8 from the outside that include the jamb i'm gonna give myself just a little bit of extra space there for a good measure. And that measurement takes us to the other side of our jam material here tada. Now we stand it up [music] yeah those little brad nails are working awesome to help create some compression. So doesn't fall down one of the benefits of having it there okay. So now we take the laser level again that we've got this wedged in we know our gap is perfect up here. So we want to see make sure that we can. Now plumb these two sides we'll just use our laser level bring it over to the wood hit the bottom of the jim.

Now we're gonna get some shims. And we're gonna shim behind every one of these hinge positions that's a great way to do a shimming if you shim outside of that your wood can be bowed everywhere union doors gonna creak like you would not believe it okay. So we got our sim pack here. Now before we get started with the shimming just a note if you're framing your own door. And you don't have a lot of experience with this make sure you buy all your material first before your friend know exactly which door you're gonna buy what the actual dimension is understand you need that eighth of an inch between every jam. And door. And door to door as well don't forget to include that you know how thick your jam materials gonna be. And then realize that if you're using longer fasteners you can allow yourself some extra space because building everything plumb is already hard enough. And if you're out. And you're little twisted a square door frame isn't gonna fit in the spaces left. So you can create a lot of work for yourself by trying to keep everything to perfect framing is not finishing work okay leave your hole extra large. And it's. So much easier to work shimming 101 they come wedges you always want to shim from both sides. And that keeps everything just straight nice. And flush. So when you come from both sides. And you put two shims together it creates the same thickness on each side of the wood. So it isn't twist if you shim both pieces from one side you end up with a wedge. And you will twist your doorframe. Now in the same respect an advanced tip here if your frame is twisted you can use that technique to help straighten out your trim bar. But we do not have a twisted frame. And so what we want to do is start off with just a little bit of shinning. And the way we id wavy id whether or not this is where i want it it's with the laser level.

So i'm gonna set up my laser level on this side of the board i'm gonna have to hit this point right here that is not my new fixed position. And you'll see that by putting shims in i'm actually causing it to both right i'm nailing that right against the wood. And it's still perfect. So no need to worry about the shim here yet for this hinge position we are going to be happy with that after we're all done i'm gonna throw some screws into these locations i'm just using the brad nailer for. Now give us a little more flexibility in moving forward when it comes to speed if you can actually build the wall perfectly plumb doesn't that make. So much of a difference okay all right time for the other side on the same thing we're gonna put that laser line right on that corner perfect let's get that position there. And we just want to keep pulling these two shims till the laser shows up on that edge of the jamb damn there it is here oh right. And so when you use the fasteners it's going to compress. So make sure you pull it. And then check with the compression that's perfect. Now before you put fasteners in make sure that it's flush to the wall. And that's only if your wall is level nice to make everything plumb as you go. But there we go okay same process down here we're gonna just go until our light shows up on our corner add a little pressure we're still good okay. Now at this point because we're using a wood jamb you could check here. And see how this is doing okay it's actually it can be forced out a little bit. But we don't want to do that until after we get the other hinge position down. So let's do the bottom first that is pretty darn close to perfect i would like to see this part pulled just a little bit tighter. So we're going to throw one extra shim here. And this is where wood is not perfect. And so if you want a perfect job you've got to be able to manipulate it here we go i like that a lot this is the point in the job almost everyone says what about the top you put in shims. And nail that all up look at how much manipulation there is available here okay resist the temptation i'll tell you why when you put your casing on you have an opportunity to get everything perfect.

Now that we have it perfectly level. And square. And plumb is to install the door hinges on those doors. And exactly the same location on each side. Then they will meet in the middle we're gonna just throw one nail in here for. Now once you're happy with your location throw a few extra screws in. And try to put them where you know the doorstop is gonna go. So you don't have to fill this hole afterwards perfect alright. Now we're ready to move forward woo. Now so. Now what we want to do is we want to find out exactly where this hinge is okay yeah seven. And three-quarter inches. Now we want to transfer that information onto this door. So seven. And three-quarters right okay problem with that there's no gap. So what you want to do is take off an eighth. And the eighth is all you need because remember our door jams are exactly plumb. So everything will be square. So we're gonna do it that way all right we're taking off an eighth. And that's our hinge mark. And we'll do that for each door yeah we'll do one on this side as well here we go all righty. So traditionally when i'm doing this i'll just take out a chisel. And my knife you know cut. And chisel deserved. But i'm thinking to myself you know for the sake of a homeowner i was in the door section. And i was like i'm gonna buy one of these kits because i already have a whole socket for cutting a hole. But this particular kit looks like it comes with a rotary tool blade. And some instructions. And a couple of parts here for hinges this is open this whole thing up try not to cut myself open again packaging is great they sure want you to make a horrible sound if you're gonna try to steal this out of the store don't they okay just for the chisel oh that was really hoping that this was gonna be kind of like a little mini router that we could use there maybe i was gonna put in my rotors it doesn't look like that's the case it's just for sticking this on.

And then you can mark out where the latch plate goes alright moving on it's important when you're doing this to know which door is going on which side. And where the hinges location are. So this might be our mark. But my my hinge is that edge okay. So it might be more thing to put this mark on both doors before you get going just. So you don't get confused once you get it down we're gonna wind up cutting in the same door twice that's my measurement. But that's my hinge location.

Now when you're cutting with the grain of the wood like this it doesn't take any energy at all. So don't hit it too hard or you just rip a hole in your door you know i'm no woodworker. But generally speaking wood is rather predictable as long as you hold that beveled edge on the same angle that will slide that chisel across. And i'll cut relatively the same depth. And this is one of these situations where less is more don't be in a hurry here's why you wanna be careful you have to building materials you've got the softwood lumber core. And you have a hard board hard density fiberboard on the face on both sides it cuts through the hard board a lot slower than it does the wood okay. So if you start here. And you get going. And you're like that's a lot of effort. And then you come over here with that same strike you'll bury the chisel right deep into the hood alright. So you want to just nice.

Now when you're setting this hinge we'll use a different hole there we go. Now because we've already drilled a hole in that middle hinge. And it's not where we want it we're gonna take some of the fiber from the wood the chip we're gonna stick it in that hole break it off create a shim. And then we can put the screw in again you know when i'm installing hinges like this i always intentionally leave at least one screw out until the very end when i know everything is perfect gene case i have to make modifications i'd like to have that flexibility of having fresh wood to set a screw the door number two same thing very important that arrow know which side the hinges go after doing that for last half an hour you be surprised how fast you be to come over here. And do the exactly the same thing. And you will hate yourself for it okay yeah before we throw the rest of these screws in let's have a look.

Now but the reality is you might only be halfway through the installation all depends on how this works out wow that line is freaking awesome you can take that to the bank that was for max okay. So our gap across the top is perfect which means that the gap on the bottom is perfect if we close the door in the middle flesh that is really close we're not gonna get that much closer i don't think it's worth the hassle to try to make that perfect all right. Now you'll notice we had a good healthy gap in the middle. And when i'm adding myself an eighth of an inch.

Now we're in the fall early winter the heating system is running everything is nice. And dry down here i don't know what it's gonna be like in the summer are these clients do they keep the air conditioning going nonstop are they big on keeping the air dry there gonna be a lot of swelling are things going to tighten up we might find ourselves in a position coming back. And packing out some of these hinges to create some extra space. And using that gap in the middle later date i don't know the point is it's nice to have the option. So now we're happy with our locations we're gonna get the rest of these screws installed okay. So in regards to the hardware i'm gonna install it right.

And film after i'm done my painting. So let's just get on with it. So for the hardware i'm going to show you this we have two doors. And on each door they're going to get a door handle on one side we're gonna put in the latch. And on the other side we will,https://youtu.be/dVr03Y6f8wM?t=1495,"['What type of hinge is used in this installation?', 'Why is it important to leave at least one screw out until the very end?', 'How does the gap in the middle affect the overall installation?', 'What is the purpose of allowing extra space for future adjustments?', 'What happens when building a house with a four-season climate?']"

And on the other side we will put on the catch in the top of the door jamb we're gonna install these rollerball units they here inside the top of the door drill a hole. And we're gonna set this in compression wise. And it's just a ball. And when the door closes it'll catch on this little it'll keep the door in position. So each store will be held in position with that assembly at the top. And in the middle it'll be latched together to help keep it in position long term. And work with all the hinges to keep it all from twisting up can't do much about the bottom of the door. But hopefully with all that in place it'll keep the door straight. And square for a long time to come. Now you want to check the instructions for these roller balls when you're at the store this one comes with a 15th 16th requirement for our drill. So i had to buy a specific blade just for that. So now i have the bit i have this. And you have the ability to set the the depth these balls are on springs. Now it's not easy. But if you take your knife closed. And you push the top of that ball you will catch those there's two little pins lines here you see that focus okay. And it's like a massive slot screwdriver okay. And you can actually raise or lower where that ball is. So that when it comes to the door it's the perfect amount of resistance you'll see it's on the spring. So with resistance it'll push past the plate. And then we'll sit back in the cradle again okay we're going to just install it. And then you can see better i think i better get my ladder for that.

And a half we're going to go from the centerline because it's important when you're installing hardware the things are aesthetically correct. So if you go to the midpoint okay the midpoint of this detail on the door it's gonna look good. So we measured off to in a corner measured to the middle made a cross on both sides. Now it's time to drill. And this will be interesting because that's a pretty good sized hole it's almost the width of the door we have to be very careful here which is why the speed bore bit is. So awesome because you can push it right into the center of that hole make sure it's not wandering around before you get going you can see i don't have a lot of room to play. So what i want to do is i want to grab the back of this chuck. And push straight down with both hands. And you'll notice that if i'm only using one hand i might push on an angle. But if i'm using both hands. And i got right in here nice. And tight. Then all my downward force is right through the shaft. And it'll help keep me straight whoop. And we've got to go that deep dear lord. Now i can't really see as well anymore. But it's already in the hole. So we used to protect my eyes from all this flying debris i'm feeling pretty confident about that let's measure this up just to see how we're doing yes you can measure your finger as a device hey we're good to go. Now be careful because this device here has these little ridges here. And these collapse. And they're compression when you force it down. And you want to make sure those ridges are going left. And right to the where all the meat on the door is if you go to the front. And back you might have drilled too close. And you'll cause the door to explode. So you don't want to do that room. And now we just take our hammer a couple of left taps here we go installed same for the other side there we go push a little bit of a drill. Now like that okay off we go. Now we got to mark our spot for these things. And it's really not as hard as you might think done okay tada okay. Now let's put these on them on the ball that's comfortable on the ball it's right on the ridge when you're looking at it the light will shine. And you'll see that ridge right there right you can see it's darker get it on the ball that's perfect it's what we're looking at is this i'm gonna drill,https://youtu.be/dVr03Y6f8wM?t=1834,"['What is the recommended method for measuring the thickness of a detail on a door?', 'Why is it important to measure from the centerline when installing hardware?', 'What type of bit is used for drilling large holes in wood?', 'How can you ensure that your downward force is straight through the shaft while drilling?', 'What should be avoided when drilling into a door to prevent damage or explosion?']"

So i'm just lining this up these little great dancer from the roller ball they just mark the thing. And so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put that edge right on there great perfect. And i'm gonna just trace that feeling that that's nice we also can check with the measuring tape after we eyeball it just kind of murk this off.

So i'm just marking vertical off where the school are it's the screw holes are that's my centerline there yeah the only thing left to do here is sharpen your pencil. So that it becomes a point or if you have a number one pencil that would be really handy okay we're gonna line up our beveled edge we're going to mark out that hole okay because when you look at this plate you will see there's there's a depth to the metal it's been stamped. And so if i just install it even though this is drilled out these two holes are gonna hold it all off the ridge this is gonna look stupid. So we don't use that for that just do a little bit of a dimple on it there we go just make sure that these fixtures will actually fit okay. So now we got our plate in position all of our holes are drilled we want to get that right smack-dab in the middle. And once you start your screw you want to use that technique where you reverse it. And burn because a lot of times these wooden jams that are really thin split. So easy it starts to smoke here we go. So now the plates are in. And what i've done is i took my drill bit. And i dimpled out a piece of wood. And i've got a set screw here. Now and i threw that in. So that when i adjust the door the jam is a slopping around everywhere we're finding that that is a really pretty decent thing to the point where i like to stiffen it up just a bit. So now is the time for us to bring out the shims. And shim above that screw make it nice. And stiff. And then drive the screw i've got a real tiny little space there. Now if i want i can tighten that up i just stuck this on the ball push the ball down. And then do the half turn just to lift out the housing holding the spring-loaded ball i like the fact that it requires a push. And once i put the doorstop in where it has something to push up against you don't function a lot nicer. But i like that good perfectly. So the next step that we have to do before we can add the doorstop on the trim is we want to core out our door for the locks. Now i'm using a laser level in this situation i'm not interested in what's normal i know 35 inches from the unfinished floor is normal for the center of a hole. But i have a 78 inch door over here. And the rest of the doors in this house down here are 78 inches. So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to center,https://youtu.be/dVr03Y6f8wM?t=2087,"['What is the purpose of marking the centerline of the hole in the fixture?', 'How does the author ensure that the plate fits properly in the door?', 'What technique does the author use when reversing the screw to avoid splitting the wooden jam?', 'Why is it necessary to stiffen up the jam a bit?', 'What is the main purpose of using shims and core outting the door for the locks?']"

So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to center my handle right off the existing door handles in the other part of the room. So that visually everything lines up i know the top is gonna be a little bit taller. But it's a bigger door that's fine it's more grandiose. But i don't want the handles to be offline - i think that would just look a little bit cheesy. So once i've got that horizontal line that looks pretty darn fine to me i'm gonna just pencil out that spot here we go. Now that may not seem like much. But that just saved me a whole lot of measuring this is four. And a half we're gonna go a two. And a quarter. And there's our hole okay hey these last plates actually are adjustable for a larger or a smaller hole alright. And that's the tuna quarter hole. So we're gonna be just fine with this. Now i'm gonna show you something here that's gonna be really revolutionary before we do that let's drill our hole. So we're going to take our little hardware kit here. And we're gonna line it up. So that my cross line is right in the middle just right above there okay no if i wanted to i could also take a little screw a set screw lock that in position all right. Now i'm able to drill all my holes. So this little hardware kit here cost about $20 in the hardware store that's canadian dollar. So it's a relatively good deal. So max says to me he goes you got your other drill i'm like this is part of the life for him all right life for the contractor i got a honey-do list i took my drill home mounted my wife's coat rack by the door. So now it looks like i'm using my slow mixture to drill a hole in the florida hole in the door to show you guys how to do this thank god for the template we're gonna see how this works okay that's. So much square all right we'll give that a shot [music] haven't even gotten to the pine yet [laughter] might be faster to drive home he got my drill [music] when you're drilling on core like this.

And you can even take a pencil if you can find your pencil clean up the resin off the teeth here you need a lot of sap. And junk that it really kind of binds things up. And clogs up. And overheats here we go again you'll notice i'm using a little bit of a wiggle motion that's just to help keep the blade from binding if i drill straight in it really super heats fast [music] alright i see the tip coming out the other side we can't believe that actually all right here's the funny part i got to use that same damn drill the core of this ode to okay. So for a cheek we're gonna go on the 17th hole instead of drilling that huge hall mmm it's probably perfect in your hardware pack you're gonna come with this right. And this is very standard everybody sees these plates. And then again you know you have to put it in trace it out get the chisel blah blah blah or you see this gap here you stick your knife in that gap. And you give it a twist both sides. And pops off. And the other piece falls out from the bottom okay your hardware kit comes with one of these all right simply line it up push that on yeah you want to install it. So that this side is actually where it's striking. And that forces it closed right that makes a little bit of sense this is just a hair to smoke that'll work make sure that is flush here take your hammer that's a 3/8 sorry 3/4 bit no 7/8 7/8 bit bam no mortising necessary that will speed up the process for you dramatically.

And we'll put the screws on the inside of the room oh wait. And we will line up this part. And that part like i said i'm gonna have to take this off. And actually patch this door that blade just choose that the garbage that was really funny. But the idea here is you want to get these set screws in position. And then start with fingers make sure you're not cross thread before you put a drill in anything like this most of the metal that comes in these hardware kits is actually pretty soft okay to finish it off pull it out. And make sure that your shot your drill bit isn't touching your door handle you don't a mark it up just do few rotations each side back. And forth. So that you have lots of room to get a good grab on the screw. And not contact the handle. And as soon as it starts to slip stop you'll hear it pump pump pump you don't want to be continued screwing that you're gonna rip apart the screw head. And you will not be able to adjust that ever again okay. Now that door that's happy that's a final resting place we do want to put this latch on the other side. So so. Now we got the her no her final resting place you can see there's actually a mark. And so what we want to do is we want to line that up into the middle okay. And mark the top. And bottom all right you know turn this around. And you want your holes right off the middle you want this part of the latch see that that's where that sits.

And that's comfortable. So if you put these holes center check with your hardware manufacturer it's good to do a rough first those holes aren't center. But the hole is okay. And that'll send her the door on each other hold them flush. So what i'm looking for is since the latch on the other door centered. And this is standard inch in inch. And three-eighths great you're looking actually for the 5/8 mark here here let me describe it in to be easier to see to be right in the middle of your scope of your rectangle here okay. So that's where you want it remember we marked the top. And the bottom based on where the door was rubbing we want to push this until that line is in the middle of this rectangle. And then we want to trace it out. And then grab the chisel this is the same process as the hinges. And you have to be real careful you do not want to split this up [applause] once you have the first part. Then it's just a matter going back. And trim it on up right i like to take that hard board down to the right depth first it doesn't have a green. So it's easier to control once you have a depth set a little easier to set the rest of the door. So we still want to drill a hole for the latch to stick into just trace out rectangle. Now for this we're gonna use the one-inch bit which is the same size as top to bottom we're going to set it up right down the middle of our hole. And we're not going to cut very deep because we have a gap here i don't work okay here you'll see these ridges here these are nice because they'll actually bite right into that soft when i add the screw. So what i like to do is just line this up give it a little bit of a love tap here we go [applause]. Now my plan was to drill another hole in this door. And then i would bring the hose through for my compressor. And be able to put on the door trim from the inside i'm not all that keen about using that bit i'm just a little afraid that something bad is going to happen it's going to come flying out of my hands.

So we want to push it. And then just take a little bit just relax a little bit why are those nails straight up okay there we go the secret to the side door is you don't want it pushed right up against the door. And the reason being the opening. And closing there's a certain amount of swing. So you want to leave a sixteenth of a gap because it's wood it's not going to be straight. So just slowly push it all into position or pull it away from the door as needed you'll see here this is a nice gap that's too tight. So pull the bottom off push the gun on.

Now listen to the the only cost difference with doing this versus our traditional wall is you have to buy a second door second handle the second set of hinges to rollerballs it's it's a little bit more right it's. But another. But not one hundred. And fifty dollars. But i think it's a great look. And it's. So much easier for getting office furniture in. And out of an office you can buy a big desk. And you can have big filing cabinets. And dollies. And all that sort of things. So it does have a benefit it's also really nice if you have a basement or a room that you want to open up really nice.

So what we have to do first of all is uncover all of the mechanical systems of this property. So that we know how we're going to tie in. So then we have a plan to move forward can't just start sticking things where i want to i've got to have the whole plan because there are restrictions. So we're going to open up the walls we're going to open up the ceiling my electrical panel is only 12 feet away. So that's handy. But i have no idea where my vent. And how my drains are going to work i have no idea what kind of access i'm going to have going through the plate through the brick to run my exhaust. So i've got to open up the ceiling in the bathroom as well once we have our whole plan we can start installing a little trick for you when you're going into drywall. And you're flying blind take your rotozip blade set it to half an inch maybe just a hair more. And then you can cut out a space. And pull it down. And then get up with a headlamp. And have a look to identify if there's anything in the way that could cause damage i know i have no plumbing up here. So that's fine. But there is electrical. And just because the code says you're supposed to staple things up doesn't mean they're always stapled up [music] okay i just went outside. And had a quick peek it looks like the vent stock is coming around right next to this window. So be in this joist cavity here. So open another hole. And we'll find out [music] all right don't even ask me okay. So there's the vent. So i can tie in right there that's amazing this pipe here is my vent. And it's perfectly normal for vent stock to be one. And a half inch one. And a half inch pipe. And carry up the ten fixtures okay. So even it has a three-piece bath with the laundry in the kitchen assuming the kitchen's actually vented that only gives me like five tops one two three four yeah. So i can tie into this which is amazing what i can't do is i can't tie into this as a waste as well. So i can't use my my saniflow pump that i'm going to connect all my new plumbing tube pump it up. And over. And into this that would have to be two inch. So you know i could open the wall see if i can find the ability to upgrade. But i'm going to wait because i've got an expert from santa flo going to be coming out to help me connect all of that. So i'm going to get them on the phone. And show them some pictures even i need help once in a while identifying solutions to problems. So i don't mind calling an expert when i need it. And here we go this pipe here this believe this or not this is what they're using as an exhaust for the fan i reach in. And i can feel it taped to the housing some three inch pipe down to this two inch pipe it's not even going anywhere i don't there's no exhaust through the brick. So this is maybe into the attic i don't know no it just stops it's just going over to the wall. And nobody took the time to get an exhaust for it that explains this because all the hot air that this is trying to pump out anytime someone flicks on the switch is just condensing right here in the ceiling because it's got nowhere to go that means i've got to change out the fan i've got to get a new exhaust. So i need a new fan location because i don't have the ability to put a proper pipe here with this venting. So i'll move the fan over. So i've got to open the whole ceiling in order to find out where the electrical's coming from. So i can identify the location for that because you can't splice a wire in the attic here i'm in the ceiling. So i've got to actually pop this off take it out of the ceiling save that wire get a new location installed which won't be an issue looks like the wires are coming from towards the panel which is usually a good thought you know if you're wondering where the wire supply is think about where your panel is. And think what's the what's the shortest distance between those two points electricians pay for the wire. So they don't want to waste their time money either. And then i've got this cavity available for the dryer this wouldn't be for the fan this one could be for a dryer gotta double check my building code for how close i can have an exhaust to a window thinking it's three feet. But it's not a gas appliance. So it should be okay i might have to run my dryer over here all right. So i've got a couple phone calls to make. And i come back with all the solutions. And then we can get started. So this is why we do things right this is what condensation looks like left unattended for years just that's where the stink was coming from in this room no doubt about it oh my god that's the best fan installation i've ever seen they got a hot wire running right against this little i don't know three inch pipe downgraded to a two inch taped onto it plumbing man oh man oh man that is just brutal okay here we go i'm gonna see if this is working hang on gonna plug this in good okay. So the switch is enough to turn the power off that's good because it was wired right  all right i gotta rip all that out because it's of no value to me okay. Now i'm using a regular drill with the erwin speedboard bit it's a self-feed auger system okay with the double blade this drills hole super quick always drill your hole right in the middle of the stud okay. Then you satisfy the code you don't have to put metal plates to protect everything okay because the coat also tells you how long a screw can be when you're attaching something. So it should be perfectly safe if you don't trust yourself you can add the plates. But generally that's how quick. And easy that is okay one for the cold. And one for the hot. And to make your life simple you just hold the tool against your body okay. And you already got the measurement for the height [music] trust me it makes a difference when an inspector comes on a job site. And he sees that all of your your holes are lined up. And horizontal they're happy because they know that you've involved some level of professionalism with what you're doing huh isn't that something somebody used a fastener mounting that sink that's too long for the wood i'm not supposed to do that i'm going to have to go up a little bit this time probably dulled my blade too burgers see it's not just about the fact that we have rules for no reason is we have rules that when we stick a 30 drill bit in a wall we don't go through somebody else's three inch screw that should have been only two inches long cheers to everybody who's done that. So here's my cold line. Now i'm just going to take my pecs through the holes. And i'm going to get this all the way over to my shower okay. And i'm going to connect my shower okay. And then once i've got it connected over here. Then i'm gonna get rid of all my slack. And then connect it over there first of all i gotta show you a new trick come on inside. Now remember when we framed this wall on video number one we left ourself a nice bit of space here to play around with. And that's because we're going to use these these clamps allow us to have the pecs make our way right into the side of the valve okay without another fitting because we don't want to create the turbulence i don't like coming up with the. And then putting in a 90. And having turbulence. And then three inches. And then turbulence into the fitting. So if i put this in first check this out this will actually wrap the pipe into a situation a little bit too far away ah get closer to the tip there that actually creates a bend that won't crimp okay it's not going to kick. And that's what we're doing we're protecting that from happening by doing this if you find you didn't have enough room to work you know you can always come in here. And you can take your cutters. And you can trim it back a little bit if you have to okay put your ring over top set it in place within a quarter inch. And then crimp it boom cold water supply is finished just for convenience we've cut this super long. And i'm going to give myself a short piece to work with i'm not fighting with the roll the whole time. So you want to basically dry fit this right. So i need this pipe coming off that fitting i need something coming through that wall okay let me just cut that real quick we'll do something about eight inches long we can put a shutoff valve on okay. So here's my plumbing. Now so how do i make all that work all right well for simplicity i'm going to use the t right here. So i need two rings all right. And i'm gonna need i need this fitting i want two rings actually i'm gonna use a shark bite tee. Now when you're doing this kind of building process any time you get an opportunity to put a ring on it on a fitting before you bury it in the wall it's not a bad idea okay you can line it all up right here in your lap. And pre-do the connection right because that's going to be one heck of a hard thing to get it get access to after the fact isn't it. But now that you're here crimp as you go okay there are two systems either you crimp as you go. And so you know you're done or you can buy a little test gauge all right. And you can just hold it up against the fitting. And if it doesn't go around it's because the diameter hasn't been compressed yet. And that's how you can tell. Now here i am i could maybe bend it into place i risk kinking it i don't know if that's gonna work that's a little bit a little bit wonky. So what i'm going to do is i'm just going to use a 90 elbow instead okay. So i'm going to cut this off at a horizontal line right there i had my ring put in my 90. Okay. And then i need a little piece to connect the two. So we're just measuring by eyeballing really trying to keep everything square. And horizontal looking it's really all we're trying to do that's better there we go twist. And cut. And i'm going to need two rings for that i'll slide it on the pipe first there go there. And then get everything in position. And then if that's falling down like that what you can do is just give it a pinch with your hand. And it'll make it more of an o shape it'll hold it in place until you can get your crimper on there okay boom. And like anything else you're doing make sure you're happy with what you do one step at a time don't go maybe. And then walk away maybe always leaks [laughter] there we go cold water's done. Now we're gonna do the same for that. So holding true to my concept of knowing the end from the beginning you want to know a couple of things before you start installing your plumbing for your shower hey are you using any tile okay. And the reason i like to say that is the height that you put your fixture at can affect the installation when you put your tile in if you're using large format tile. And you don't want to have a grout line going through just the very top of the trim you want to balance it out you might want to know where your tile line is going to be. So you could draw that across your wall. And then mount your fixture on either on the mid section or if it's a big tile you can mount it to be in the body of the tile that's a consideration for us we're using polystyrene because i'm cheap. And i love the simplicity of having a waterproof system that's all in one that doesn't require any special tools. So for the purpose of getting occupancy in this church we're keeping the budget as friendly as possible i'm just going to go with what's comfortable. So i stand here. And i stick out my hand that's where i expect the faucet line to be okay somewhere around here okay piece of cake. And then we've got a,https://youtu.be/4E3sRo3ScA0?t=0,"['What type of venting is typically used for exhaust fans in residential buildings?', 'How do you determine the location of electrical wires in an attic?', 'What is the purpose of using clamps when installing PEX tubing?', 'Why is it important to crimp fittings as you go while installing plumbing?', 'How can you ensure that tile lines are balanced with shower fixtures?']"

And then we've got a shower head. So we need to know the height. Now here's where it gets interesting because the kit that comes in the shower is 72 inches. So i'm going to put that line on the wall. Now we have two options because we're going to have two different surfaces we're going to drywall. And then polystyrene we want to have the flange cover which is inch. And a half on one material or the other not half. And half. So please do measure this off just for fun i like to have my shower head coming out nice. And high. So that no matter who buys this place if they're tall they're going to be facilitated. So it doesn't matter if the water supply comes out above the styrene polystyrene wall we're going to go with an 80 inch shower head boom right here okay. And the reason we're going to do that is because at least i am guaranteed that my flange is going to be away from this by the time the water starts coming down i don't care if god drips splashes up on the painted wall we're using a bathroom paint when we finish. So the polystyrene will be sealed there. And everything will be just fine.

So no big deal all right. Now let's move on with mounting our blocks we need two pieces at 15. Yep. And then we're just going to screw them in we'll start with one of the top because it's interesting [music]. Now for location we already know the height right there we go that's the height for the depth we got to have our fitting okay. Now this is a drop here made for pecs. So this is where the shower arm will get threaded into. And generally speaking you want this behind the drywall all right. And so what you want to do is stick this over here. And tap the block until it clears the face of the wood okay. Now you'll see i'm only about half an inch from the back of the wall that'll be perfect. And anywhere on there is going to work fine. So i'm just going to grab a few wood screws. And i prefer to screw it from the outside coming in it's a little bit of a drop down here. But that's okay there we are okay. Now we got a bit of a tilt we'll fix that. And you're going to want to use at least three screws. But i would suggest four just because you don't want anything moving around after the install. Now when you're gonna screw at an angle start your screw go in reverse back the screw. And then while it's spinning change the angle that you want in reverse. And it'll pre-bore the hole exactly where you want to go. And then you drive forward. And that keeps it from splitting every time all right i know good trick huh here we go for mounting it we want one inch screws one one. And a quarter one. And a half whatever we have in your arsenal just resist the temptation to use drywall screws because they have a really weak shear strength. And you're gonna find it's going to disappoint. Now before we can screw this on we need to know the center point of this,https://youtu.be/4E3sRo3ScA0?t=907,"['What is the recommended number of screws for mounting blocks?', 'Why is it important to pre-bore holes when screwing at an angle?', 'Where should the shower arm be threaded into the drop?', 'How far from the back of the wall is a suitable location for mounting blocks?', 'What type of screws should be used for mounting blocks?']"
1055.0,2361.0,Plumbing,PL34cQkzKfXWZ06_3PaDAJsb0FnlzN4JYd,Installing A Shower Valve with Great Flow Rate,4E3sRo3ScA0,Installing A Shower Valve with Great Flow Rate: Measure the Center Point,60109848-2224-f5d5-54ee-9c7c80589c6f,Before we can screw this on we need to know the center point of this wall. So to measure the center point we're going to measure from the flange to this indentation which is where the glass panel is it's 34 inches interior okay. So half of 34 is 17. And because we put everything in nice. And plumb we can just measure from here plus a half an inch makes it 17. And a half because we have to include for the tile flange this is going to become our center line we'll do the same thing for the valve fixture. But for. Now let's just get this installed one step at a time okay. Now the secret here is to get everything mounted. And confirm the measurements you can use a laser level or you can use  just measure off the marker. But instead of going nice. And tight leave a little bit of flexibility it makes it easy to do the installation of the plumbing afterwards you get your pipe on there. And then you can drive the screws home after the fact okay. Now we're just setting set up for success here all right [applause]. And who'da thought plumbing was this simple right it's almost like carpentry nowadays. Now for this one we're gonna stick it in the wall where we want it nice. But we don't know exactly how deep to get that information we've got to open up the box. And confer with the instructions because every manufacturer has a different requirement for the depth in the wall. Now to be honest i have not used a moen faucet in a long long time i've done a lot of service work on them over the years. And that's because they have a lifetime guarantee on their parts okay here we are here's our fixture. And it usually comes with one of these little plastic covers on it. And this is your depth cover okay what i mean by that is this this to here usually represents the range of thickness of your finished wall. So if you were to install this fixture like this. And then you add a half inch drywall. And then large format tile you'd find that your fixture was too deep in the wall. And you would have needed to bring it out a little bit more okay. So what you're doing. Now again we have to know the end from the beginning okay we got a half inch drywall we got eighth of inch polystyrene. And so what i'm going to do is i'm going to aim to be basically anywhere in this range this trim kit will install just fine okay. So i'm going to set the plastic on the wood. And i'm going to mark i'll do it over here i'm going to mark right off the back of my my pipe okay that's my mark. Now watch this just for simplicity my two by four is too thick. So if i go flush off the back of the wall let's see how that finishes off okay yes i am raised off a quarter inch. But drywall plus polystyrene leaves me right in the right in the middle which is perfectly healthy okay does that make sense if i had the wood too far far forward. Then i'd have a gap here yeah that's that's i can do this i'd have a gap after the finish okay. So my finished trim wouldn't make contact with the wall if i go too far back. And i try to use like a piece of strapping all right. Then my handle isn't going to function because this can be jammed up against the wall all right. So you got to find that sweet spot where your finished wall after tile after whatever is somewhere in the midst of this little area here okay in almost every situation i found in my experience if you put the 2x4 flush to the back of the the frame this always works all right just saying it's a pretty safe bet i only went through all that information because a lot of people are out there you know you're doing custom bathrooms. And that information is really relevant for you if you're adding drywall. And waterproof membrane. And then large format tile. And maybe your walls aren't as straight as you'd like them to be. So you're going to be adding a lot of cement it can really add up. And so you want to be careful if you're not exactly sure okay. Then for the love of god set it as far back in the wall as you can alright because there are ways there are ways to back off the mounting screws right. So you can see these two holes here those are mounting screws all right. And if your fixture is in the wall. And you find it's too deep you can back out the screw pull it out of the wall okay. And then you can tighten it up just a little bit you can put shims in behind or something. So you can you can build it up. And make it nice. And solid there are tricks. But if it's too proud. Then you got to tear your wall apart to fix it all right here we go okay. Now we're going to line up flush. And i'm going to stick that wood together because it's a little warped i love being able to go from the outside of the wall i'm gonna just disengage the cover okay okay. So now you can you can visualize what's going on here. So we've got a hot water in cold water in to the shower that's the back that's a mounting hole all right. So on this panel there's two mounting brackets for attaching the fixture. And there's two threaded holes here that come with machine screws for putting the finished trim on when you're all done we'll put the whole assembly  for the finished trim later in the video series okay. So if you're looking for all that information it'll be there. And if you're looking for this after all the videos have been released you can check the video description. And it will have links for all the different videos in the series okay that'll help you all right. Now let's get this mounted i need about a two. And a half inch screw yeah that's plenty of meat okay same thing 17. And a half right here we go wow. And this would mount like this [applause] [music]. And like this. And if it's twisted you can back off the screws okay. And then tighten again we've got a left. And right top. And a bottom. And you can manipulate that until it sits resist where you want it. Now the truth is that is mounted. But we're not quite ready for doing this yet because you can see that this comes with the npt thread on the outside. And we're plumbing with pex. So we're going to actually add the conversion pieces to this. And that's a little secret when you're in the store shopping realize that especially the box stores they aren't selling any plumbing fixtures that come ready for pecks you can have the store people open up the box. And you can take a look sometimes the box will have a picture. And they'll show what kind of thread you need this is what we're gonna do we're gonna do one at a time just. So that we don't have any problems. But you just take your teflon okay. And you lay it on the threads you hold it with your thumb. And you stretch it. And you just twist it right on that thread three or four times okay you break it off. And you want to make sure that you're twisting the same direction you'll be tightening the fixture in. And with this go backwards until you feel it click there it is you heard that. Then you can go forward okay that was how you make sure you don't cross thread it if you cross thread these plumbing fixtures it'll be leaking for the rest of its life inside your wall. And it'll drive you crazy all right here we go there's no need to worry about how strong you are or mechanical function here there's no power tools necessary these are machine thread this has been the same thread size for over 100 years all the way back to galvanized pipe this is not rocket science if you go four twists of that teflon you're going to be just fine there it is boom perfect every time all you need is a wrench. And the ability to twist it in circles if you're concerned about your strength you can get a second wrench. And get on the body of the valve. And you can twist opposite directions. But by the time you're struggling at all trust me you got it on there tight enough. And the beautiful thing about pex is even if you install it all. And pressurize the lines to test the water make sure it's not leaking if it develops a little drip you can just go ahead with your wrench reach in. And give that another quarter turn to get rid of the drip even after all the plumbing is connected okay pex is that flexible here we go. Now our plumbing is roughed in. Now we can screw that to the wall right in the same spot [applause] okay i'm happy with that. Now the cool thing here is because it's raised off the wall you can actually connect all your plumbing even with it fully engaged not like up here where you want to leave a little bit of room okay. Now let's go get some pecs. And some connections we're gonna use solid brass rings  i know a lot of people on the internet have been using the pinch clamps they're more for exterior water irrigation systems than they are for interior plumbing although the store sells it in the plumbing aisle it's not really meant to be inside the house. So we're going to use the solid ring crimp i'm going to show you how that works. And how to measure. And cut this plumbing parts. And don't forget all the tools you're going to need we have a special section on our amazon store dedicated to our plumbing tools. So you can go check that out. And get everything all right there one spot. And you don't have to spend a fortune for this stuff especially if you're doing the occasional job okay you don't need a high quality tool for something like this let me just go through the process real quick here's what i mean by a solid copper ring okay it is exactly that it's a solid copper ring. And this clamp is for half inch or three quarter pipe. And when the ring goes in here it doesn't fit. So what you do is you compress it. And it actually makes the diameter of that ring smaller okay. And the amount of force that it takes to make that stretch to the point where you get a leak let's just say it doesn't exist in any natural environment. So you have no worry about it ever leaking again this is garbage because i can never ever get that to work we're gonna use i'm gonna be bold. And i'm gonna get all the same color pecs  we're dealing with supply chain issues as well as the rest of the world. So i got a hundred feet of this one pex it was available. And i said sold i bought it. And here's how you work with it it's as easy as cutting with a pair of scissors okay. And i'm telling you right. Now it is really that easy you take your rings slide it over your product okay. And then you put it in place. And then you double check your measurement until you're perfect right there no measuring tape needed no fuss in a boat if you cut it a little bit long that's okay because it can sit in the wall like an s all right there we go get the ring clamp up there. And down here you want to be a quarter inch away from your fitting for best results. And go done guaranteed i'm a little bit over my head here might have been smart to put that on before i screwed it in. But i wanted to show you the flexibility of the product right okay. Now that that's where it's supposed to be we apply all of our screws done okay. So that's that's the first half that right it's more carpentry than plumbing. Now i'm going to do my hot. And my cold water lines. But first i've got to drill through my wood. And provide myself a path to connect to where the water supply came from all right. Now we're going to jump into the last part of the rough in plumbing system. And that is basically this  i know this is a little confusing maybe because most people have already got plumbing in the floor when they're going to change a shower pan. And so the rules are a little different as long as you've got your p-trap established you don't even need a permit to to change out your fixtures if you don't have a p-trap established. Then you've got to get a permit because it's involving  gases. And trapping. And venting okay. Now what we're going to do is i'm going to just add this to the back side i'm going to actually glue all this in place. And finish this assembly rough-in plumbing basically means for most scenarios that if you wouldn't have access to see what's going underneath the floor it means you're going to put the plumbing in. And then the inspector will come. And see through the floor where your plumbing location is. And you're going to have your pipe you're going to have a cap on it okay in this scenario because he can see how it's run down here i don't need to worry about that i can just finish the assembly. But just remember for most people roughing plumbing is just simply pipe extending through a hole in the floor capped you pass. Then you put the shower pan in i'm doing this a little backwards because i got access all right just want to clear that up before there's any confusion we're going to be coming straight from this location out the side. So the first thing we want to do is open our glue which is always harder than you think. And we want to run it around the fitting. And around the street on that pipe. And line them up all pipes are going to have this mold joint on it okay. So you can use that to line things up. So you know that you're going straight okay that's awesome that's the mold joint. And it's on all fittings you can use that to line things up square okay. So now we got that. And our shower pan is designed for a two inch piece of pipe you only need one. And a half inch drain system for showers. But different plumbing fixtures come with either two or one. And a half. So you've got to make sure you can make the right conversion it's good to open up all your kits. And everything before you go to install. So you can get the right material at the store i didn't have this set up properly. So i had to go to the store. And i get a one. And a half to two inch conversion. And then i can put my two inch pipe into that okay. So and that's where that fits with that gasket. So let's just do this in proper order whenever you're putting a fitting together on a rough end it's nice to leave just a little bit of room okay. So that if anything was to happen. And always do both sides of the fitting you have something that you can cut out. But since this is going to be buried in the floor we don't have to worry about that all right we're just going to go nice. And tight done okay. Now i'm converted. Now i need a piece of inch. And a half that will extend. So i can cut later. So i'm going to measure to the center of that hole i'm going to bring the pipe up 20 inches from the center i'll dry fit i'll measure 20 inches from the center that made in canada right there that's where we're going to cut all right. Now i'm going to glue that joint we use the word glue. But this is actually a solvent what it does is it kind of melts the surface. So if you melt both surfaces together. And then twist them together you get a really good bun okay there we go. Now we're going to rough fit this. And put it in position i'm going to dry fit this together okay just to get an idea. Now what i want to do just. So the inspector is happy with everything again this is a little creative going backwards. But it allows me to get a lot more production the funny thing is is they don't need to come back. And inspect the shower pan after you've installed they just want to know that nothing's leaking. So when they do a final they're going to run the shower they're going to go downstairs maybe look at the ceiling. And see if the water's coming through which doesn't do a whole lot of good for anybody okay secret here is when i lift this pipe i'm actually looking at how the drain pipe is sitting okay. So when it falls it's on an angle when i lift this it's square. So that's what i'm looking for i want that height. So what i'm going to do is over here i'm going to throw in a screw this is just metal strapping it's called all around everybody needs to love this stuff because look what it does that's where i want it i can just set my all around there we go. Now everything's nice. And square all right problem solved. Now this all around can be temporary okay once i get the plumbing connected i'm good to go remember because the p-trap sitting on the ground. Now i can do my measuring from up here add my solvent. And get it the right depth. So what i want to do is i want to have the right depth. So that when this is inside the hole it's all the way down there okay. So i want my pipe to come to this height. So i'm going to mark this right here let me put it on the camera i want to go this height with my pipe okay. Now i can take my measuring tape i'm going to set my tape on top of the fitting. And measure to that black line it's two. And three quarters okay. And just. So you know here's a fitting. And there's a ring inside that marks where the end of the pipe would go. So you take your measurement plus the interior dimension which is three quarters i know this already. But i'm just doing this on camera. So that you know okay three quarters. So whatever measurement you get from the top of a fitting you add three quarters that's where your pipe extends to okay here that should help. So let me take that measurement again because i forgot my number okay. So we are going two. And three quarters plus three quarters is three. And a half all right there we go. So now i'm going to go cut this at three. And a half on my saw because i don't have enough strength in my hand to use one of these on a two inch still healing from an injury all right. So we've got three. And a half. And because it's a shower i am deburring the pipe okay i don't want things like this in here see this right here that's inside the pipe that's going to grab shower here. And it'll clog up. So fast it'll blow your mind especially if you've got someone in your house with super long hair right here we go. Now we got that done i am confident that we can finish this install okay here we go don't drip on the shower pan keep the solvent there. And we'll get it on this side of the pipe as well okay. And now we are going to push them into place right to that joint perfect. Now i'm going to slide my rubber gasket over top okay all right. So here's the problem we're running into in theory this all works great okay with this kind of gasket. And i'm struggling with this because i'm like i'd love to be able to make that go all the way down  you see how the inside of this is ribbed okay. And it's also tapered. And so in order for me to get this rubber all the way down to where i want it i'm going to have to beat the living tar out of this thing.

But before the drywalling the moisture barrier is actually behind that framed wall. And this is basically just directing any moisture that comes through the concrete through frost. And condensation  even small leaks it's just to direct that moisture to the floor. So it isn't soaking into your insulation. Now if you have a spray foamed basement. Then obviously you don't need it spray foam would be sprayed right onto the wall. So but this is if you're using bad insulation okay. So just starting over at the left my left  what i would consider kind of the best method other than spray foam is to attach rigid foam to the,https://youtu.be/P5E2X8Q5jcQ?t=6,"['What are the three different products that can be used as a moisture barrier against concrete basement walls?', 'Where is the vapor air vapor barrier typically located in relation to insulation and drywalling?', 'Why is it necessary to direct moisture from the concrete through frost and condensation?', 'How does spray foam affect the need for a separate moisture barrier?', 'What type of product is best suited for attaching to the wall as a moisture barrier?']"

So we actually have a video showing you how to actually attach it. So i'm not going to go into that detail  you can watch the other video for that. But basically in this case we've attached 1in rigid foam to the wall  we've sealed it can you see in the corner there  maybe down at the bottom you can see i've sealed it with  canned spray foam. So any spaces. And gaps. And in the corners. And stuff we've we've sealed it with some spray foam. So simply get it attached seal it up. And then you can you're ready to frame your wall. And that in front of it okay. So that's that's one way  the other two ways are dealt with a little bit  differently. Now it with the spray foam it was going right from floor to underside of joist. So these ones don't these ones here first we want to attach some type of a wood strip to the concrete wall that's 12 in above the exterior grade. So if your dirt outside is you know somewhere down here this needs to be about 12 in above 6 to 12 in would be fine attach it to the wall doesn't take very much to do that. But you will need a hammer drill  i've just used a screw in type anchor  attach that to the wall. And that's just simply there to hang these two products from okay. So the the first product that you could use would just be  a 6 mil poly sheeting. So plastic sheeting. And obviously this is just a little wi strip just a sample right you're you're covering your whole wall if you're doing this. So it would be hung just simply by stapling it up here hung down to the floor level. So then it directs any moisture down to the floor. And it isn't soaking into the to the studs. And into the insulation. And creating a mold problem okay. So that's that's one  the other product that you could use would,https://youtu.be/P5E2X8Q5jcQ?t=69,"['What is the best method for attaching rigid foam to a wall besides spray foam?', 'How does sealing gaps and corners with spray foam benefit the process?', 'What type of wood strip should be attached to the concrete wall above the exterior grade?', 'Why is it necessary to hang plastic sheeting along the wall?', 'What are the two different methods for dealing with moisture issues in walls?']"

So that's that's one  the other product that you could use would be a a house wrap like an exterior house wrap. And same idea just simply get stapled to this wood strip that's 12 in above grade. And hung down to the floor just like that okay. And that's all really all you need to do. Now with either one of these products as you're going along  anywhere where you've got to overlap at a joint or whatever overlap it by two feet don't tape it or anything just overlap it the idea is here to direct the moisture down. But also still allow the wall to breathe because there's no insulation value to this with bad insulation walls  heat. And moisture from inside the house can transfer through the wall cavity. And if it hits a cold surface it creates condensation or frost the condensation creates the frost. And you have a moisture problem. So this this isn't supposed to be sealed in order. So that it can kind of dry dry from either side cu the wall breathes both the concrete wall. And the wood wall breathes this is a little different situation it we do want to seal it because it is creating some r value. So we're trying to stop any warm moist air from the inside of the house from getting in contact with this cold concrete in the winter okay. So so this one we are sealing it right up. So the,https://youtu.be/P5E2X8Q5jcQ?t=186,"['What type of product can be used as an exterior house wrap?', 'How do you overlap joints in a house wrap?', 'Why is it important to allow walls to breathe?', 'What happens when moisture hits a cold surface?', 'When should insulation be sealed in a wall?']"

So so this one we are sealing it right up. So the spray foam. And red tape on any joints these these sheets come in usually 2t by 8t lengths or or 4t by 8t lengths. So so anywhere where the joints are tape it up also   if you look here this is a piece of the rigid foam it's got a a joint like this. So the joints kind of overlap each other it isn't just a straight joint right back there. And it prevents the cold from transferring through because of the lap. So the other sheet would have the opposite lap. And it would just butt right up against there. And you tape this on the inside okay i think  that's pretty pretty much all you really need to to know  like i said  we do have a video on showing you how to install this already. And we actually do have another video dealing with  mo moisture barrier we've we were doing the poly one there in a b level. So it's a little little bit different. But if you want to watch how it's actually installed you can go there. And watch that  in order of preference to me spray foam would be my first choice. But obviously cost is  usually the determining factor in that process number two choice would be the the foam the 1in foam on the wall number three would be the host wrap. And my last choice kind of would be the poly. So the. And the only reason there is because this breathes a little bit better. But yet it sheds water where this sheds water. But doesn't breathe as well okay. So hopefully that kind of cleared up some of the   misre representation of what a moisture barrier is. And also showed you a few different options that you could use to if you  are redoing your basement. And want to want to figure out which which one of these products you'd prefer to use.

And is layer on layer. So our first job here today is to pull all this siding off. And exposed back to the original siding of this house which we hope is still there. And hope it's still in decent shape. And then we'll see what we have to do to go from there. So as you can see there originally with the door here unbeknownst to us. So that changes our approach a little bit. So originally i think our doors gonna go somewhere around here. And our plan was to remove these boards where our door was going. So that we can install our door with our brick mold flush up against the board. So we're gonna continue with that i just going to drill,https://youtu.be/JJWdYHU-VaM?t=0,"[""['What type of house is being renovated in this video?', 'How old is the house being renovated?', 'Why is it difficult to determine what's beneath the siding?', 'What is the goal of removing the original siding?', 'What was the original plan for installing the door?']""]"

So this is one of the challenges you have when you're dealing with such an old structure foundations is settling there's nothing square or level in a new home try a hundred. And forty years old like seriously the goal here is to try to create a scenario where any moisture that gets in behind the exterior of the building or in behind the framing of the door we're just gonna follow the path of least resistance we want to create a path of resistance. So that it follows back outside of the building again.

And we're going to install cement poured probably three layers a half-inch. And we'll bring that right up underneath this blue skin. And then we'll wrap that over top. But if your building is in solid condition. Then what you do is you just wrap this over the facade okay. And that's your exit point we're going to install this here this is about the spot where the door closes for people actually if they step on the transition are gonna stand on it. And now that we have that done i'm going to take my last layer okay. So here we go. Now we've got a membrane. And you're gonna see what i'm doing is i'm creating an environment here where the water gets in it's gonna run down it's gonna hit this plate. And instead of coming into the building because the house is sloped. And it's sloped in it's gonna come into this area here. And then be directed out okay that is the secret this is what we call the jeff approved method you're not going to find this on that website anywhere in the world.

So the other thing you want to do is you want to seal up the side of your house what i'm going to do is start from the bottom. And work my way up that way i can be confident i have enough to finish the job at the bottom here. And this stuff actually stretches around pretty good. So you can manipulate it. And mold it the way according what you need this stuff sticks really good to new wood not. So good to old wood just staple the bugger on until you get the time to get the type are. And then you can red tape it all in. So now the house is sealed up yeah once we get to the next step. And we'll talk about it when we go to the siding about finishing the water diversion system when we want to focus on this down here when we install our door jamb right we're gonna be foaming installation spray all the way down. So water won't go past that it'll be directed down the front on the inside of this 1 by 3. And then the only place that'll go to run this way because the building slopes that way. And it'll find the exit here it's the only option it has that's why it's gonna work. So effectively when we put the door. And we're gonna use these cedar shims. And we'll build up this corner to get the level point. And then block a few others points along the way. But every six inches that'll give it some strength we'll foam that gap we're good to go. So i'm a little spoiled rotten ear today cuz i got my helper doing all the heavy lifting.

So you can actually set it in place. And then we can put another 2x4 across in front that allows you to manipulate the door. And get it level in square. And shim. Then everything just the way you want it. And then you can remove once you've got a screw in. And then you can remove all this extra framing brilliant. So really all you have to do here set up your level once you've got your level established. Then it's about making everything flush as long as the wall is relatively plump. So we're gonna go like this right off the edge of the my frame on the corner here i'm going to show my laser line.

And i'm just gonna lift this side with shims underneath the jamb which is where the end of the support. And half of this plate the reason for that being you want support both on the jamb that's carrying part of the door. And on the plate when people step on it it transfers down over you'll ever put the shims in backwards the two ramps when i slide them together it creates a perfect little rectangle. And makes the door nice. And flat nice. And flush. So i would do. Now is i hold the bottom shim. And i push the top one in while i'm lifting up the weight to make it thicker hopefully put this where i want it oh nice this is just a matter of trial. And error there we go nice. And plumb we know that if this doors level here most likely that's i'm sorry if that's plumb there. Then this is probably level here let's throw the cross line laser on let's have a look yeah that looks pretty good there's the benefit of having a laser you can use the level to create plumb as much as you like though you're installing a door. And you have a laser you are guaranteed a perfect result every single time. So now that i got my plumb line i know my door fits the hole everything's comfortable i just traced the line where the flush i put this line where that shim goes together. And i know that that combination of shim is the same thickness here as it is here as it is underneath the door. So as long as these two lines are at the door. And not the other ship no matter where i put the store in a minute it's gonna be perfect okay. So we can get rid of all of this. Now and we can remove hard extra 2x4 here. So remember there's a two-by-four keeping the door from falling out on that side right.

So what you want to do to install your door is open your door up right there set it on your 2x4 find another couple of pieces of blocks maybe a few shims set up a nice line all right we'll throw the laser on this we're just gonna throw it on the detail or the door it's not flesh yet it's gonna take a couple more shims it's always plumb in really old houses getting anything perfectly plumb is tricky sometimes the more important if she was flushed like outside we really want to have our brick mold flush to the outside of the house it's not plumb. So our door isn't gonna go in perfectly plumb at this point the only issue it has is if it's left open a crack it might have the tendency to open a little bit more which is fine i'd rather live with that. And make sure that the outside of the door is completely plumbed. And flush flush gives me waterproof. So if you have to choose between plumb. And flush go with flush every time. Now we're just gonna take a few shims you can see this is there's a lot of room to play here right from this side all over this side we want to get these things in here about every four inches. So that when anybody steps on this there's a direct load transfer from this plate into the shim to the wood. And that will keep everything from breaking apart. And opening up gaps over time that will cause nasty drafts there we go you don't want to lift this you just want to create contact it's really easy to over shim. And then your end up creating a bow. And then your door won't seal properly we're not gonna foam the bottom until we have the entire doorframe screwed in because if we did cause a bow we won't know until we go to close the door. So we're gonna get the,https://youtu.be/JJWdYHU-VaM?t=650,"['What is the first step in installing a door?', 'Why is it important to ensure the outside of the door is flush with the surrounding brick mold?', 'How often should shims be placed between the doorframe and the 2x4?', 'Can a door be installed perfectly plumb without any issues?', 'What happens if too many shims are used, causing a bow in the doorframe?']"

So we're gonna get the rest of the door installed first. And then we'll come back to it. So the door comes a little package with my missing hinge screws. And the idea here is as you put shims in behind these. And you use this as your anchoring point. So really the whole goal here let's just get the shims in or the snug back it up. And then come from this side. So that you keep the everything's square all right before we drive these screws in well throw the laser level on it one more time real quick just to confirm whoops there we go we want to snug remember if it's not snug when you drive the screw it'll pull it in tighter you'll get a bow how it looks pretty good i don't know if those screws are long enough. But we'll see [music] what we want to do is we want to put a screw on this jam. But we don't to put it here where it's visible we want to bury it where it's not ever going to be covered up. So if you ever have to make adjustments you have access to it remember as the house moves. And breeze. And stretches. And expands you might want to make adjustments to your door over time. So what we're going to do is pull this out of the way gently okay take your shim. And hold it right there. And then take your screw right up against that shim. And then when you release this should basically cover everything up. Now new door is always gonna have a really good seal on the bottom all right. Now you can see what your gap looks like here. So we know how much to manipulate this jam. So you really want to do three locations on your jam the bottom middle. And top if you need to add another one to get rid of a warped you can. But let's start with the first three okay okay okay the gap is good opens up too much right not a problem there we go that's the beautiful thing about shims you can adjust down to 1/32,https://youtu.be/JJWdYHU-VaM?t=779,"['What type of screws are used for door installation?', 'Why is it important to bury screws in the jam?', 'How do you make adjustments to a door over time?', 'What is the purpose of using shims behind the hinge screws?', 'Can you add additional shims if needed?']"

And try to push it to the other side you'll end up over foaming. And you're not concerned if the foam gets all the way to the other side because your thermal break on this wall is where the door is the door is only r5 nothing you can do about that you're going to spend as much money on as the doors you want there are five wood or glass r5. So you want your insulation to be in line with the thermal break. So what i do is i am on an angle. And i'm just shooting a door. And window bead that's gonna have some expansion. And i wanted to expand towards the front. And towards the rear at the same time. And the trigger on this gun gives you an incredible amount of control to give you an idea i can really shoot a lot of foam out of this gun in a hurry okay. But just a little bit of pressure on that trigger that's you filled the gap or the speed that you're comfortable with this gets rid of the air gap. And the draught it's not gonna give you any structural support that's what the cedars for don't rely on the foam because it will not carry the load all by itself the reviews too much you can just trim it off later.

And it needs to be level all the way around the room using a carpenter square i measure down from the bottom of the floor joist. And make a mark to indicate where i want the top of the wall rail it's important to come down low enough to clear any obstructions yet high enough to maintain adequate ceiling height extend ending a level line all the way around the room can be done using a 4t level or by measuring down at two points on a wall driving in a nail.

And her weight simply pull that toggle right out of the wall. Now i need to make a repair here that's strong enough to hold the new toggle when i put it back in again before starting i head out to my van to get a couple of tools. And the material i'll need to make the repair [music]. Now this is a scrap piece of half-inch wall board it's the same material the wall is made of the first thing i'm going to do is to cut a small patch out of this that's slightly larger than the damaged area right here to cut wall board i make one or two passes over the paper front with a sharp knife break the board. Then score or cut the paper on the back i always like to keep a few wall board scraps around just for repairs like this next i place the patch over the damaged area. And trace the outline onto the wall i also mark the top. Now this is a wall board saw you under stairs a really nice sharp point right here.

And when you think about it well it really has to be because i used the patch as a template to draw the outline. And then i put this arrow up here. So that when i put this back in it's in the same position as it was when i drew the outline next i apply some glue to the back of the patch lay a piece of quarter inch plywood on top. And attach it by driving screws through the wall board. And into the wood. Now this long screw right here is going to be a handle.

And the reason we're soldering is because the original valve is all copper. And solder joint. And so we run out. And we bought a valve that matches the same kind of installation. So we don't have to do any pipe cutting just got to clean all the fittings up. And put it back together with a brand new shower valve this is the way to do it nice. And [music] simple. So the secret i mean the big secret to doing copper valve installation from an existing valve are this right here anyone who doesn't take time to read the instructions on a product nowadays you're just setting yourself up for failure guys every one of these products that comes out has new design elements different requirements for how deep it goes in the wall different techniques for building. And removing parts every manufacturer is a little different. And every manufacturer is. Now developing more. And more. And more complex unique scenarios because they're more concern with the design style than the function it seems nowadays. So you have to be really careful like for instance this one this plate gets put on the wall. And then you attach this handle to,https://youtu.be/p8VDRvucpxQ?t=0,"[""['What type of valve is being installed in today's video?', 'Why was soldering necessary for the installation?', 'How did the plumber choose a new valve that matched the existing installation?', 'What are some common challenges when installing a copper valve from an existing one?', 'How do manufacturers design and develop unique scenarios for plumbing products?']""]"

And then you attach this handle to the cartridge body. And you tighten it up real tight. And you create this compression fitting between the handle. And the plate. And and the valve on the other side of the wall. And then the shower functions from here if you don't get the depth set on this properly you're not going to have contact with the wall or you won't be able to your hand will be sticking out. And it'll look like junk or you won't get proper contact with the wall. So do your measurements take great care here cuz this is almost a little bit too tricky it's a little ridiculous. Now because we've got the water off. And it's been draining for quite some time everything will be nice. And dry. So we're going to start off i checked the tub spout the connection for the tub spo with this particular kit requires a longer stem on the copper so,https://youtu.be/p8VDRvucpxQ?t=72,"['What is the purpose of attaching a handle to the cartridge body?', 'How does the compression fitting work between the handle, plate, and valve?', 'Why is proper depth setting crucial for the shower function?', 'What type of connection does the tub spout require with this particular kit?', 'What happens if the measurements are not taken carefully during installation?']"

So i'm going to put in a longer piece of pipe for. Now after i'm done all my tile work i'll measure back. And cut it later. So for today i want to make sure that i get this one removed first. And that's what we're going to start with. So here we go just got to add some heat until the solder start starts to bubble up try not to burn the wood in the wall i'm just gripping it with my pliers. And giving it a bit of a twist as soon as i see a solder start to melt out of that little spot there i i'll be good to go. And come on baby here we go just about. And there we go okay the reason you want to use pliers for this situation is cuz it gets very hot. Now inside that elbow fitting it is beautiful it looks like a solid silver it's nicely coated the the weld there was done really well all right. So i've got a piece of copper that's just sitting in my my plumbing kit just for such an occasion going to give it a good fresh scratch make sure you got some good copper color. And then put on some flux paste on this bad boy. Now or may not go in probably not exactly. So what we're going to do is we're going to heat that joint up again. And when that slides in. Then we're going to add a little bit of fresh. So done nice. And quick take our paste. And we're just going to wipe that in okay there we go make sure it's nice. And square to the wall the whole joint. Now is all heated up. So we'll just let all that seal up nice. And square beautiful.

And then i'm just going to hit the elbow up hopefully all of this connection will stay intact just waiting for the drip. And there it is not quite yet got to heat the backside the brass is very thick. And it takes a long time to heat up. So when it finally does there we go that one's released. Now this side okayo.

So i can actually grab the valve body with my pliers. And i can twist it or i can just wiggle it here we go see this little wiggle up. And down. And we're sliding off there we go okay it's like being a blacksmith in the 1400s. So now we're going to put this valve body in we're going to start with the hot. And the cold.

And the cold. And the shower all at the same time basically. So what we want to do is we want to just prep all of the ports on this valve body nice. And simple. Now when it came together it came together in a certain way. And it usually has markings on it it'll say hot. And cold h. And c this one just has arrows that means intake. And on this part it marked cold. So make sure you get it going the right way i don't know if it' make a great big difference i mean looks like a pretty mirror image. But not going to take any chances i didn't engineer it. So i don't want to reinvent the wheel all right. Now that part is done. So the other thing we want to do is we want to get flux inside all of these you'll see that these fittings are designed for a half inch copper or you can put compression fittings on whenever it's possible to solder or to crimp versus using compression fittings i prefer to do it i've had really bad success service calls. And compression fittings over the years you just never seem to get that thing on tight enough it always wants to drip in the wall cavity after everything's all finished drives are bloody crazy all right. Now this is most likely a little warm right we just want to give it a little bit of love with the sand cloth cuz we don't want to be fighting too hard putting this valve on holding in place stick all right the idea is is i'm going to heat up this one. And i'm going to stick this up here solder that on. And then we're going to let it cool for just a minute. And then we're going to put the hot. And the cold in. So first you want to heat the old pipe up the old solder connection not too much you don't want to burn it all. And you want to heat the brass okay not the solder the brass will get hot it'll turn melt the solder on the copper,https://youtu.be/p8VDRvucpxQ?t=416,"['What type of valve body does this content describe?', 'How do you determine the correct orientation for the valve?', 'What is the purpose of flux in plumbing?', 'Why are compression fittings preferred over soldering or crimping?', 'What happens when a compression fitting is not tightened properly?']"

Now we just want to get it squared off with the wall a little bit of paste here we go. Now i'm pretty confident that the solder that was on the existing pipe is. Now sealed inside my brass ring okay i put that on there more like a weld just in case it's still hot i wanted to be able to hold its weight here. Now now we're going to hold this. Now take this off set that aside for. Now now you'll see that the original hot. And cold are not in line with the new valve different manufacturer right. So we have a different issue going on. And that is fine what we're going to do is just take my drill. And we're going to disengage it's warm. But it's not too hot we'll go with one screw at the top for.

So we're waiting for the solder on the existing copper pipe to start to sweat. And melt up. And then we'll add a fresh [music] bead remember keep the heat on the brass cartridge. So that cuz it's thicker it takes longer to heat up. And you'll though it'll be hot enough to receive this weld as soon as the copper starts to sweat here there we [music] go okay same on the other side. And this is just to make sure that there's enough solder material inside that joint to seal it up after we've removed. And sanded it from the last joint all right there that's step two okay. So now we're we have the the roughing 3/4 of the way we want to set up our center line before we start attaching things to the wall. So we're going to come down here. And measure the the screw head on our overflows 14. And 5/8 we're going to see yeah they were off center okay from the original instruction was off center that is awesome. And not just a little bit it was off a full half an inch. Now that's not a lot if you're using subway tile. But if your grout line is anywhere near these center line in these fixtures one glance you can say oh that's out a square that's just ridiculous brilliant we're going to do this with our [music] pliers okay again we're going to heat up the bile body. And slide this up there we are. Now we want to square this off. Now i'm just going by eye you only have a few seconds here until this solder starts to really set it. So oh perect okay. So now we want to take a little bit of fleux around this joint as well. And just throw a little fresh solder up there. And make everybody happy going to hold this up with my knee. So it doesn't slide out of the hole see how it wants to fall down here hold it in place. And i use the solder no that one's crooked well if at first you don't succeed try try again [music] that was just to square it off i lost my alignment okay. So check our measurement here as well 14. And 5/8 perfect. Now the wood that i have installed for this valve it's too short. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to prop this up this way couple pieces of scrap from the truck.

And shrinking after construction is completed sometimes leaving a small gap between the framing. And the back side of the drywall an inadvertent bump or even the sudden change in air pressure from a slamming door can cause the wall board to move pushing the fastener head outward applying drywall adhesive before installing wall board can prevent nail pops from happening when using a drywall adhesive trim the cartridge nozzle to create an opening of between one quarter. And 3 8 of an inch. Then puncture the inner seal apply an even bead of adhesive to the center of the wall studs set the drywall in place press firmly. And screw or nail the perimeter in addition to eliminating nail pops there are other advantages to using a drywall adhesive wall board that's installed this way often requires fasteners only around the perimeter whereas drywall put up with just screws or nails calls for several additional fasteners in the center or field it's also said that drywall installed with an adhesive can help eliminate drafts. And provide sound dampening i decided to find out for myself by building a couple of test models on one frame i attach the wall board with adhesive. And screws. And on the other i used only screws. Then i connected a hose from the exhaust port on my shop vac to the back of the test modules. And began forcing air inside on the screw only prop it was clear to see that there was considerable leakage at the edges of the wall board while on the screw. And adhesive frame there was virtually no evidence of escaping air. Then i subjected both units to the tomtom test it was clear to me that there was much less sound transmission on the frame with the adhesive [music] it seems that installing drywall with an adhesive seals against drafts buffer sound reduces the likelihood of nail pops. And cuts down the number of fasteners required all good reasons to consider this approach the next time you're putting up a wall,https://youtu.be/tuIWWTD3BOc?t=76,"['What causes nail pops in drywall construction?', 'How does using drywall adhesive prevent nail pops?', 'Can drywall installed with an adhesive help eliminate drafts?', 'Why is sound dampening more effective when using drywall adhesive?', 'What was the outcome of the test models built to compare screw and adhesive installation methods?']"

Now what i want to do is install a decorative archway. So that i can frame this opening into the living room. Now when i was at the international builders show last year i saw something that caught my eye. So i'm going to go online. And see if i can find it a google search under curved archway kit leads me to www.curvemakers.com after a little bit of exploration around their website i find what i'm looking for. So i place my order a few weeks later i get the word that the kit is on its way. So i go to work preparing the opening the first step is removing the existing casings in jam to keep from damaging the surrounding wall i first cut through the paint. And caulk with a utility knife. Now i like this style knife for the job because i can simply break away a dull blade exposing a fresh cutting edge for this job no question about it sharp is better to keep from crushing or breaking the wall board i drive a wide putty knife behind the casing tap in this flat spoon shaped bar. And pry the trim gently away once i've opened up a gap i switched to this type of pry bar which gives me more leverage. And movement [music] it's not unusual for the casing to pull off the nails leaving them still embedded a pry bar or hammer will pull them out. But again i use the wide putty knife to keep from damaging the wall [music] typically the door frame or jam is nailed into the framing at several points the nails are usually driven through shims for me the quickest way to free the frame is by cutting through the nails with a reciprocating saw using a multi-purpose blade that's designed to cut both wood. And metal nails with all the nails cut the door frame tilts right out of the opening i'll also have to remove the baseboards once again using the wide putty knife to protect the walls well i've encountered encountered small hitch it seems these switches are too close to the opening. And will prevent the archway column from slipping into place the solution is to move them a couple of inches to the left first i remove the switches from the electrical box. And then begin cutting away the wall board. So i can gain access to the wiring next i remove the staples holding the armored cable in place pry the electrical box bracket free from the wall stud [music] it's what i'm hoping to do is screw a 2x4 to the stud. And attach a 1 by 4 on top. Then remount the box if i have enough slack in the cable i can do it thank you it works. Now it's time to replace the wall board first i attach cleats or backer boards to the left top. And bottom edges of the opening. Then using 80 grit sandpaper i create a small bevel around the opening. And on the edge of the patch. Then attach the drywall with several screws this technique stabilizes the joint. And along with the bevel will allow me to make it completely flush repair without the need for tape i can simply apply the compound press it firmly into the joint. And over the recessed screw heads. Then skim off the excess i'll let this dry do a light sanding. And probably come back with a second coat [music] foreign i get a coat of paint on that you'll never know i was inside that wall. Now chances are you won't have to relocate an electrical switch if you decide to put in an archway. But you know what i found more often than not i do run into some kind of little problem some detour. And as you can see it's just not that big a deal to handle it well i'm going to grab my archway,https://youtu.be/tuIWWTD3BOc?t=252,"['What type of knife is recommended for removing existing casings in jam to prevent damaging the surrounding wall?', 'Why is it better to use a sharp utility knife when removing existing casings?', 'How do you typically remove door frames from their nails without damaging the surrounding area?', 'What tool is used to cut through shims and metal nails when removing door frames?', 'What technique is used to stabilize the joint in drywall repairs after installing an archway?']"

Now it's time to bring in the new archway. And get the opening ready to receive it foreign well this is my archway kit. Now even though it's very detailed it really only has three components an archway header. And two archway columns you know you're going to be really amazed at how easily this goes in first step in preparing the opening for the archway kit is installing 1 by 4 cleats to the framing on the upper corners [music] once they're in place i match wall board using drywall screws [music]. Now i'm careful to countersink the screw head slightly. But not enough to break the paper face when i finish the first side i move on to the other [music]. Now i put the columns into place temporarily [music] cardboard template that comes with the kit on top with a marker i trace the template outline onto the wall board oh. Then remove the template. And the columns using a drywall saw i cut along the line creating a curve that will form the top of the archway [music] finally i applied joint compound to the seams. And skim off the excess with the modifications to the opening complete i install the first column by slipping it over the edge. And pushing it into place next i slide the archway header into position piece of one by two to brace it notice how i've cut the brace just a little long. So that it forms a slight bend when it's wedged into position. Now i fit the second column over the left side of the opening check both columns for plum. Then lower the header. So that it's resting on top of the columns finally i use a finished nail gun to secure the columns. And header to the framing just a few nails are all that's needed the nail holes are easily filled with spackle [music]. Then it's time to apply a coat of primer that will be top coated with a semi-gloss enamel [music] you know i think the word elegant is often overused. But in this case i believe it applies.

And that is what we're going to do right. Now very simple we're going to start with a couple of wooden squares like this this is three quarter inch birch plywood on top of that we're going to put one of these bearings we'll mount this on top of the base put the turntable on top of course these will be cut into circles first simple project great results. So let's start i will be using a jigsaw to cut those squares into circles. And well we could do this by hand. But sort of following a line around there. But you know what i can never really get a really clean circle that way. So what i want to do is make up a circle cutting jig with a jigsaw very very simple to do i'm going to make it out of this material right here this is a quarter inch tempered hardboard. And we'll start by clamping this to the workbench. Then i'm going to take a square. And draw myself a line just like that. Now we'll take the jigsaw. And cut right down the line to that mark. Now what i want to do is attach this circle cutting template to the bottom of our jigsaw temporarily let me cut this circle. And the best way to do that i believe is going to be to use some of this double stick carpet tape. Now we'll take the jigsaw place it in this groove that we cut earlier stick it down to our template next i set the assembly on the wooden blank with the jigsaw blade touching the edge. Then drive in a small nail as a pivot point. And get ready to cut all i've got to do. Now is move the saw in a circle. And we should have a pretty accurate disc here the cutting platform i'm using here is three pieces of plywood bound together. And to my workbench double stick tape anyway there we go perfect circle next i repeat the process to cut a smaller circle for the base of the lazy susan. Now we are going to turn plywood into something that looks like solid wood by using a material called wooden edge banding this is it right here it actually is a strip of solid wood very very thin with a hot melt adhesive on the back of it. And it couldn't be simpler to use in fact all you need is the edge banding. And a regular iron lay this in position just kind of make sure that it's centered over the edge the iron is on hot. Now as we apply heat to the face of the tape we're softening up that hot melt glue on the back. And we want to use a lot of pressure on the iron right here. But i don't usually rely just on the iron i like to take a roller like this this is a laminate roller. And just come over on top of it just to make sure that that gets pressed down very securely when i finally come around to the starting point i overlap the edging on top of itself. Then make a diagonal cut through both layers leaving a nice clean joint. Now this is that bearing that we're going to be using we want to make sure that we mount this exactly in the center of the base this is actually a center finding tool right here. And you'll notice that these lines are all crossing at one point that's the center of the circle right there. Now i can take the bearing. And just pretty much by eye. Now place it in the center. And then we can attach this with some pan head screws next we rotate the other side of the bearing a few degrees pass an awl through one of the mounting holes make a starter mark on the wood. And drill a half inch hole all the way through this is our bottom. Now we set the base in place bottom side up. And rotate it until the hole we just drilled lines up with a mounting hole on the bearing plate. Then we insert the screws that will attach the bearing plate to the top we repeat the process for all four holes of the plate. And finally i apply these four soft adhesive plastic feet which will keep our lazy susan stable on any surface well here it is our lazy susan.

And faded well here's a one day deck rejuvenation project that will restore your deck to its original glory oftentimes sunshine is a good thing. And something we want more of especially inside our homes if you don't have enough windows to let the sun in what about adding a tubular skylight it's considerably easier than you may think it's time to head out to the workshop for a project that's fun to make.

So bad it seems like there's just nothing that can be done with it. But restoration of this deck is not only probable. But it's virtually guaranteed it's been several seasons since this deck last received any tlc as a result the wood is dried cracked. And discolored. And the previous finish is badly chipped peeling. And in heavy traffic areas mostly worn away another troublesome symptom is protruding nails caused in part by the deck boards repeatedly getting wet. And then drying out a process that can actually push the nails upward. So the first step is to reset the fasteners flush with the surface using a hammer. And drift pin to avoid denting the wood itself the deck boards also have two additional problems they've weathered badly from years of exposure to sun rain. And dirt. And they're made even more unattractive by the patches of the previous stain that remain to help correct both of these i'm going to clean the deck using a power washer the power washer needs a water supply which will come from a garden hose attached to the inlet port on the water outlet side i'll attach the high pressure hose. Then connect it to the power wand power washers typically have interchangeable tips that create a fan-shaped water pattern for this project i'm using a 15 degree nozzle which will provide a more aggressive pleating action to avoid damaging or etching the wood though it's important to keep the wand moving at all times. And hold it at least six to eight inches from the surface when using this tool properly the results are immediately visible. Now this came out pretty well just with a power washer. But i'm going to take one additional step here i'm going to apply a deck cleaner. And brightener just to take off any residue. And lighten up some of the darker spots before beginning i'm wetting the grass. And shrubs near the deck this will dilute any cleaner that runs off the edges i'll also repeat this after completing the cleaning. And brightening step this three-in-one wood cleaner from thompson's water seal removes stains from dirt mildew algae. And fungus eliminates tannin. And rust stains. And brightens the wood bringing it back closer to its original color when using any deck cleaner cover arms. And legs put on rubber gloves. And wear eye protection pour the cleaner undiluted into a sprayer screw on the top. Then pump 25 to 30 strokes to build up the pressure on warm days like this i pre-wet the deck surface to keep the cleaner from drying too quickly. Then spray on the cleaner. And brightener i found that cleaners like this perform best if they are scrubbed with a synthetic bristle brush this works the solution into the wood. And helps loosen surface particles leave the cleaner brighten around the surface for 10 to 15 minutes. Then rinse the deck using a garden hose or power washer. Now things are looking very good except for a few areas where the old stain is stubbornly clinging to the surface i removed some of the larger spots using an orbital sander. And 80 grit paper because water applied to bare wood will nearly always raise some grain i also sand the handrails making them smooth to the touch sanding is an optional step. And isn't always necessary to protect the deck. And keep it looking good i'm using thompson's water seal waterproofing stain. Now this product contains elastomeric polymers that help the dry stain expand. And contract with the wood during temperature fluctuations reducing cracking. And peeling before sealing the top deck surfaces i want to coat the sides using a brush that's narrow enough to fit into the spaces between the boards my preferred tool for applying a sealer is this deck staining pad a long handle allows me to do the entire job standing up what's important here is to bring the pad into contact with the solution. But not submerge it. Then use the ribs on the pan to distribute the material evenly across the surface the pad allows me to work the stain. And sealer well into the wood assuring a good bond i usually apply the material to three or four boards at a time always moving the pad in the direction of the grain re-wetting the pad frequently ensures an ample coating that's evenly distributed this sealer also has acrylic polymers which greatly improve resistance to scuffing. And marring another thing i like about this combination stain. And sealer is that it can be applied to damp wood this means cleaning. And coating can be done in the same day this applicator incorporates a small brush into the pad making it possible to apply sealer to the deck board sides at the same time the top surface is being coated it also has an onboard container which does away with the need to dip. And re-wet the pad the thumb dial. And trigger determine the flow rate to the applicator head i prefer a smaller pad when it comes to applying material to railings. And balusters on vertical surfaces apply the sealer from the bottom to the top to avoid drips. And runs this sealer dries to the touch in about two hours. And its coating is resistant to mildew. And uv damage from the sun because it's semi-transparent it does an excellent job of concealing any color variations in the wood itself creating a blended yet natural look well although it may have looked hopeless in the beginning you've got to admit this turned out beautifully. And it's a project that you can do in a single day thank you [music],https://youtu.be/5EhQuO55dGM?t=83,"['What type of deck is described in the content?', 'Why is the wood on the deck dried, cracked, and discolored?', 'How does the protruding nail problem occur on the deck?', 'What tool is used to clean the deck with a power washer?', 'What is the name of the three-in-one wood cleaner mentioned in the content?']"

But the sun will definitely play a part in this house call i'm on my way to salem oregon home of jeannie. And william bragg. And their dog lacy the brags have a family room that gets very little light. And they'd love to brighten it up i think a tubular skylight would be perfect for them. And today we're going to cut a hole in the roof. And install one together how's it going excellent how are you pretty good pretty good hi welcome who's this hey lacey how are you i don't know about you. But i am ready to cut a hole in your roof what do you say all right let's do it shall we do it this way okay okay come on this is the room oh yeah this is a quite a bit darker than the rest of the house isn't it you know i think part of it's because of this paneling in here probably soaking up a lot of light yeah we replaced the carpet we put a white carpet in here. And we were thinking we sit on this side we thought we'd put put it up in this area right up here okay a tubular skylight consists of a roof dome lightweight reflective tubing. And ceiling diffuser sunlight enters the dome is channeled down the reflective tubing. And enters the room through a diffuser softly illuminating up to 100 square feet all right. So let's get a piece of tape. And put it up here right. Now with a piece of masking tape genie marks her preferred location for the diffuser teamwork okay. So that's the ideal spot next she uses a stud finder to locate the ceiling joists there it is we're gonna drop this tubular skylight in between the ceiling dress we don't want to be cutting those our goal is to cut a 14 inch diameter hole in the ceiling centered between the ceiling joists genie begins by drilling an exploratory hole where we believe the center point to be okay i want you to push this through the hole. Then she inserts a coat hanger through the hole. And into the attic from inside the attic william locates the coat hanger. And checks to make sure we're clear of the joists. Then he positions a flashlight alongside the coat hanger. And aims the beam up to a clear spot between the rafters which he marks next he drills a hole through the roof. And leaves the bit protruding. So it can be seen from the outside. Now we have an unobstructed line from the roof through the attic into the family room the bit marks the center point for the opening will be cutting in the roof william this is the flashing eventually the skylight dome is going to attach to right. Now though i want to get it centered over that drill bit. So if you get directly over it look down okay. And let me know if i need to move this a little bit that's looking pretty good right there yeah right there right. Now i want to take this  lumber crayon right here okay. And draw a circle on the inside of this right up next to the edge okay the flashing acts as a template for the opening we'll soon be making excellent okay looks good excellent okay there we go there's your hole next we slip the reciprocating saw under the shingles. And cut the roofing nails around the edge of the hole this will allow us to slip the flashing underneath the shingles we secure the flashing to the roof with a few screws okay william go ahead with the flashing in place we slip a section of reflective tube through the center. Then set the plastic roof dome in position. And secure it with screws okay guys time to cut your ceiling. Now we've destroyed your roof. Now your ceiling. Now it's time to cut a hole in the family room ceiling for the diffuser a drywall saw gets the job done in a couple of minutes what we're going to do. Now is we're going to construct a long tube which is going to go up through that hole. And connect to that piece that we put up on the roof it comes in sections like this. And what i want to do is ask you guys to go ahead. And hook these together first of all start by putting these tabs in these slots right here okay just go ahead we assemble the individual solar tube sections by simply inserting tabs through corresponding slots okay i think we're ready to go okay. Now this is aluminum tape it's got a peel. And stick back again. So peel the back off that way okay we're gonna put this right on top of the joint okay the tape will hold the sections together. And prevent light from leaking out at the seams burnishing or rubbing with a cardboard roller ensures a good seal okay genie can you pick that up. Now one sec we're going to assemble the first two sections that one goes right inside here okay about an inch. And a half we assemble the sections by simply inserting one inside the other. And then taping the joints [music] good [music]. Now this is long enough. So it's going to go all the way up. And connect to that the assembled sections are lifted through the ceiling hole aligned okay i see. And slipped over the roof section we installed earlier okay a flange on the bottom section is screwed into the ceiling. And finally the diffuser which will soften the light is snapped in place well i tell you i can't believe the amount of light that's coming through that that's incredible it's really lightened up this whole corner of the room yeah [music] well i think i think we got what we were after here don't you i think that's fantastic cause for a celebration i have something here for you a little souvenir for the middle first time you cut a hole in your roof i think you should have that as a memento oh my god something to remember the experience i can't believe we did it we did this is great.

Now what i like about this particular design is that it's expandable modular simple. And yet as you'll see quite elegant we're going to make it out of one of my favorite woods cherry. So let's head to the table saw. And start cutting [music] i'm cutting several pieces of wood to two basic sizes these six inch by 12 inch pieces will serve as end panels while narrower three inch by 24 inch cross rails will hold the bottles themselves with all the wood cut to size i'm about to cut several notches or dados i'll put four in each end panel. And four in each cross rail these dados will actually lock the cross rails. And end panels together to do this i'm installing a dado set on a table saw this consists of several cutters or chippers sandwiched between two saw blades i've made a couple of other additions too i've added what's called an auxiliary fence just a piece of wood onto my miter gauge there's some sandpaper glued to the front here to keep the wood from slipping. And i've clamped this stop lock on right here. Now that allows me to put the piece of wood in exactly where i want it. So that dado is going to be cut precisely one inch from the end each time i put a piece of wood in here i'll simply slide it down into contact with that block. And make our cut. Now one other thing we're going to do here to keep my fingers away from that blade i'm going to clamp the wood on like that. And i can hold this further back [music] first i cut dados. And all the cross rails. And then in all the end panels [music]. So this is how the wine rack works these cross rails just interlock with the end pieces like this. And we can keep stacking them up or put one section next to another obviously one thing missing here though. And that is that we have to have some way to support the wine bottles. So we're going to have to cut out some partial circles or arches a smaller one for the neck. And a larger one for the base of the bottle. And we'll do that over here on the drill press [music] these arches with a hole saw i've clamped a fence to the drill press right here cut a hole away using the saw itself. So that i can position these right up against the edge like this hold them in place we'll just turn this on i select hole saws that are slightly larger than the diameter of the bottleneck. And body first i make the arches that will support the lower portion or body of the wine bottles. Then i switch to a smaller hole saw to cut semi-circles that will accommodate the bottlenecks finally i use a drum sander installed on the drill press to smooth the edges an orbital sander is the best tool for smoothing the flat surfaces finally to bring out the natural beauty of the cherry i apply a couple of coats of tung oil [music] i've applied this oil quite liberally. And after it's been sitting for just a few minutes i want to wipe off the excess with a clean cloth never want to let this dry on the surface otherwise you can end up with something that's a little bit sticky well believe it or not here's our wine rack large enough to hold 15 bottles of wine it kind of goes together like a set of lincoln logs take a look [music] this rack will cradle a regular wine bottle just about perfectly. But it can also accommodate champagne bottles.

And make something hi i'm ron hazelton welcome to the show you know there are times when it makes a lot of sense to combine two smaller rooms into one larger one. But today we're going to do the opposite divide a larger space into two distinct living areas without actually putting up a wall well at least a full wall.

And catherine moorhead have they taken care of their share of projects since they've bought their house a while back. And had their sights set on the next challenge catherine in particular has a very clear idea what she wants well we're trying to add a little separation. And a little bit of interest in the living room den area right. Now it's just a huge gap in a lot of the new homes that are going off you see these beautiful columns separating two rooms. And i thought why can't we do that here. Now i don't see any reason at all why ben. And catherine can't have exactly what they want i figure they just need a little bit of a jump start. So i head over to ridgefield to see about creating a bit of separation for my friends hey guys hi ron thank you very much i love the rocks i guess that's where the ridge comes from the ridge here that's right. So these are the two rooms you kind of want to separate a little bit yes you don't want a wall up here no we decided against a wall we like open space. But the problem is this this window this room was added afterwards this room over here was added yeah. And it looks like it's just bolted onto the house there's really no transition okay. So you think by making a a pair like there's more of a division between these two rooms exactly. And give it a little interest a little detail. So so what are the actual dimensions you're thinking of i was thinking about 40 inches high. And perhaps 17 inches wide 17. Yeah that's very precise 17 inches it is not 20 you know 15 17. 14 are always very precise well that's good. Now i'm not doubting catherine's judgment. But just to make sure i construct a simple plywood mock-up to help us visualize the dimensions maybe a little too close too much okay let me come into about how about somewhere in this range maybe one more inch what do you think you know honey you're the decision maker here. So okay i like it well catherine's happy. So ben checks things out from his point of view i like this is fine,https://youtu.be/88csy_9rbtU?t=70,"[""['What type of separation are Ben and Catherine trying to achieve in their living room?', \n'Why did Ron suggest creating a division between two rooms?', \n'What was the original intention behind adding the second room?', \n'How precise were Ben's measurements for the mock-up?', \n'What is the main issue with the existing transition between the two rooms?']""]"

And we're going to use these to make up a wall frame. So if you just kind of hang on to that for me i'm going to attach these together with some three inch screws [music] okay. And you grab that piece of 2x4 right there okay. And set it right up on the top okay i'm going to have you put these in [applause] perfect excellent lay this right on here that'll give us the extra thickness we need the wall that we're connecting to is a little thicker than typical. So we're adding strips of one by two to our frame to give us the added depth we'll need excellent okay. So there's our wall frame i'm just going to sit right in here like that okay we attach the wall frame first to the existing wall. And then to the floor [music] when it's secure we head out to the garage. And start cutting the drywall that will cover it first we score the paper on the face of the wall board. Then stand the panel on edge break it along the score line. And finally cut the paper on the back excellent. Now we're just going to snap it back the other way like this okay there's your cut i don't think. So this is half inch wall board here if you want to grab your  your screw gun right there let's go ahead. And start putting this in start here [applause] all right. Now we make it a real wall closed on both sides [applause] [music] okay catherine [music] [music] our next step is to attach this metal bead to protect the otherwise fragile edges. And give us sharp clean lines guys the only thing i remember here is try not to hit the corner because if you do we end up with a dent. And they're not too pretty. So just take your time okay enjoy okay you ready. And we'll. Now have dual hammers or is it dueling hammers time for a little taping okay done this before yes you have i have. So you're taping the taper of the family oh well let's just dive right in. Then all right it's very nice catherine catherine is putting down what i call a bedding coat of joint compound we'll cover the joint with paper tape which i first dip in water. Then pull between my fingers to remove the excess moisture from my experience i've found damp tape like this it hears better if you want to place that. So the center of the tape is right on the seam again keep the knife flat. And you're pressing it in okay okay ben you're up ben uses joint compound to conceal the flanges on the metal corner bead. And blend it into the wall the compound we're using today will set in about 45 minutes. Then we'll apply a second coat. And when it's dry sand it smooth well we've got both of our knee walls in just finishing up the sanding on this one over here how's it going great it's going well looking good oh that's nice really nice okay well you've been busy doing that i've been out cutting  this ledge or shelf whatever you want to call it it's going to go on top here this is a piece of poplar. And all i've done is sort of cut a notch out of it put a little bit of a round over around the edges here. And this will just slip right in here like that that looks great very nice touch it's not going to go anywhere. Now we're going to start trimming out the insides of your openings here with i guess you'd call it jam material all right. So let's start with the top piece right up here okay this kind of woodwork or mill work as it's often called adds interest. And detail to just about any room it can turn a wall from ordinary into elegant [music] foreign well i'd say ben. And catherine did a fine job without me. But now they're going to need my support hey hey look what i've got a new cone oh wow you made a mistake i think i'm a little too big for the opening right here seriously though you do have to decide what portion of this you want  top bottom middle what do you think top because of all of the detail up there what do i think honey you think the top the top looks great to love the way you two just agree on pretty much everything. So the column comes with a capital. And a base i'm going to stack the capital. And the base on top of each other. Then i'm going to give you a tape measure if you'd measure from the top right here yep to the jam i'll know how long to cut this column it's 34. And 7 16. You got it okay let's cut. Now getting a straight cut on a tapered column like this can be a bit tricky for me the best way to do it is to draw a line all the way around. And make the cut with my japanese handsome wow beautiful the shortened column is attached to the base by applying glue. And then toenailing glue is also applied to the top of the column the two sections of the capital are set in place. And nailed [applause] [music] perfectly let's give it a try all right well should we give it a go hey you did it it looks nice good job came out great yeah you have to get them really on the flat oh look at that already a beautiful oh man well you know when you see a paintbrush in hand on a project like this we're nearing the end [music] well i'm gonna go you guys you can finish this up you've got it well in hand well you got us there ron appreciate it oh you're very welcome thank you stay up too late. Now okay we won't do it. And enjoy the room bye-bye sweetie between your design. And his  skillful implementation we've really added a lot of value here don't you think absolutely are you happy i love it well. Now that's quite sweet who would have thought that separating a couple of rooms could bring a couple even closer together you know i'm not one to shatter misconceptions bigger is not necessarily always better,https://youtu.be/88csy_9rbtU?t=202,"['What type of wall frame was being assembled?', 'What material were the strips added to give extra depth to the wall?', 'What tool was used to score the paper on the face of the wall board?', 'What type of woodwork or mill work adds interest and detail to a room?', 'Why is it important to apply glue to the top of the column before nailing it in place?']"

And that's got me thinking about outdoor living. But when i took a look at my outdoor furniture i realized well it had taken quite a beating over the winter. So it's time to give it a facelift. Now this is a two-step process first i'm going to clean. And brighten it. And then restore the color because the wood is very dry i'm going to first wet it. So the solution i'm about to apply will be absorbed more evenly. And will not dry out too quickly i'm also wetting down the patio to dilute any runoff this cleaner in brightener will do two things remove accumulated dirt. And restore the sun. And weather darkened surface to something close to its original color i'm going to apply the material with a pump sprayer [music] starting near the bottom. And working upward to avoid drips that could leave streaks [music] being a solution to sit for a few minutes it's time to do a light scrubbing to loosen stubborn soil. And sun-damaged wood cells for harder to reach spots i use smaller brushes it's really the cleaner. And brightener though that's doing most of the work [music] that's really evident when it comes time for rinsing the old surface is literally washed away revealing fresh bright wood underneath i've given the furniture plenty of time to dry. Now for a little light sanding with 100 grit paper both the weather. And water i've just used have raised the grain the idea is to even out the surface a bit. But not over sand it making it too smooth could prevent the wood from adequately absorbing the finish the tight spots i sand by hand in the direction of the grain you know i'm just amazed at what a difference a cleaner. And brightener can make on outdoor furniture even though it may look really bad like this one did to begin with. Now i want to put a protective coating on here. And add some color back. And i'm going to do that in one step using not a liquid. But a gel stain like this one. Now one big advantage to this when you're using it on things that have a lot of slats no drips i find that a brush works well for applying the gel stain to the edges [music]. And getting in between the slats. And other tight spaces [music] your pad that comes with the stain is ideal for putting the gel on flat surfaces [music] the pad spreads evenly. And does a good job of working the material into the grain foreign [music] outdoor furniture that we started with. And just in case you've forgotten how they looked well take a peek not only do they look terrific. But they've got a protective coating on them that'll see them through the summer. And well beyond [music] as a do-it-yourselfer you know that prying things apart is a very common task no doubt you also found that it's important to have the right tool for the job these are some of the prying tools that have proven most useful to me. Now i'm about to add another it's called the trim puller by zenith industries as its name suggests this tool was made for removing wood trim without damaging either the trim or the walls the ground bevel on the edge allows the tool to be easily driven between the trim. And wall the integrated center wedge. Then continues to separate the materials in some cases this wedging action alone is enough to complete the job the trim puller is designed to be leveraged side to side because of the wide contact area. And greater leveraging effect trim removal goes faster while wall surfaces remain undamaged the tool quickly easily. And safely removes shoe molding baseboard chair railing. And door casings it's ideally suited for lifting carpet tack strip. And edging the trim puller can also be used for prying off molding from decorative panels or doors without the risk of damaging either it's also quite effective at removing ceramic tile the integrated center wedge combined with the tool's wide surface area enable it to quickly pop tile away from the surface beneath the trim puller can be used as a temporary shim when leveling base cabinets or for prying off cabinet countertops that have been glued or nailed in place it even comes in handy when replacing damaged floor planks removing shoe molding baseboards chair railing door casing carpet strips tile. And more it's always impressive when a single tool can do. So many things.

So many things. So well [music] some of the wider ones like this one have a standout of almost 10 feet. Now this makes it much much easier if you're working by yourself. But one thing the tape measures are not great at doing is making inside measurements like this you kind of have to roll them into the corner. And do a bit of guesswork well here's one way to get a more accurate inside measurement using a tape measure take a framing square sometimes called a carpenter square. Now these have two sides usually one is 16 inches. And one is 24. Lay the framing square in like this. And then use the tape measure to measure from the end of the framing square to the end of the opening. And simply add the tape measurement to the 24 inches of the framing square for a very accurate inside dimension to view today's projects again visit ronhazelton.com where you'll find hundreds of how-to videos available 24 7.

And arlene sapphir in albuquerque new mexico they call themselves two old hippies. And run an internet business from their home. But it's not their home office that needs help it's their guest bedroom two rather unattractive closet doors break up the wall. So the seir would like to replace them with doors that double as display cases. And i'm going to help it's. So nice to meet you oh thank you come on into the house i've drawn up some plans for the project. And go over them with phil. And arlene this is what i have in mind here this is essentially a case  or box if you want to think of it that way with shelves that we'll put in here. And we can space those shelves any way you guys want them depending on what you're going to put in there. Now this will be just about the same size as your door we're going to take the door out. And then we're going to place this in the opening on hinges. So it'll swing out. And then to make it a little bit more decorative. And also to hide this joint here  i want to put on some decorative moldings like these some fluted moldings with some corner blocks up here all right. So what i want to do. Now is  is set up sort of a temporary shop in your garage as we're going to have to do some cutting here we're about to cut strips of plywood that will be used to make up the sides top bottom. And the shelves of our units each piece will be 5. And 1/2 in wide. Now this is the stuff we're going to make your bookcases or cabinets from this is 3/4 in thick birch veneer plywood okay it's the best material for the sides. And the shelves we use something else for the back after measuring. And marking the plywood we attach a self-clamping straight edge running the base of the circular saw along the straight edge will guarantee a perfectly straight cut after cutting several strips to width we move on to the chop saw to cut them length in almost any cabinet making project you end up having to cut a number of pieces of wood to the same length. And we're going to be working on the shelves right. Now we need several of those at 212 in. Now we could measure. And mark each one of those. But you're can always going to get some error when you do that. So we're going to measure once. And then we're going to cut a number of these as many as we need without measuring again to make these consistent cuts we attach a wood block called a work stop 21 1/2 in from the saw blade the length of the shell when the wood contacts the work stop phil lowers the saw okay. And he. And arlene take turns cutting the shelves with all the shelves cut we next cut the two side panels to link righty another side. Now it's time for assembly. And then over here i've done something which will help us assemble the corners i've just stacked up some blocks here nailed them together. So that when we get ready to attach these which we'll be doing in just a second this will kind of help us sort of orient everything in the right position our lean begins the assembly process by drilling pilot holes through the top panel of the display case next phil runs a bead of glue right over the pilot holes we press the top panel to the side panels using our assembly blocks. And then secure them with screws okay we repeat the process for the bottom panel. And now we're ready to move on to the shelves i've asked you guys to bring down some of the typical things you're going to have on here cuz. Now is the point where we have to decide what our shelf spacing is going to be. So what we can do is kind of temporarily lay a shelf in here. And our just see if some of that's going to fit. And if it doesn't. Then just move that shelf down or up all right i'm going to move this down there okay. And i think it should have some space above. And below okay you move that one down let's see how that looks like all right that feels about right. But i would like to see it with just four shelves if we can to see i'm going to take this one okay i think i agree i'll move these down i actually i like that better actually i think i do too four shells well that'll make it easy i use a combination square to mark the final position of the shelves. Then we run a bead of glue over the ends. And attach them with screws. Now we're going to put one more board in right down here this is actually not a shelf it's more like a false bottle. And what it's going to do is give us a surface to which we'll attach a piece of trim later on. So same idea u put some glue on the ends right here okay put it in place. And screw it in position. Now all of our shelves are in. So now it's time to put the back on. So if you guys would lay a be go all the way around the outside. And across the back of the shelves okay i like doing that there we go all right i think phil's got a future in cake decorating i really do just drop that right on the back of the bookas case is put in place. And secured with an air powerered stapler we've transferred the shelf lines to the back panel. So that we can see where to put the staples. Now we're going to have some fun we're going we're going to decorate. And embellish this basic case here  starting with this fluted molding here. And then on the bottom of that  we're going to place  a what's called a plinth block this is supposed to simulate a column. And this would be the base of the column. And then across the bottom i want to add something like this this is a base board remember we put this extra shelf in earlier that's. So we can support both sides of this. So this will go on here. So let's start down here at the bottom. And then work our way up to the top okay we attach the plinth block. And the rest of the molding with a combination of glue. And nails we've also decided to add wooden rosettes to the top corners these decorative moldings are only attached to one side of the case a matching set will be attached later. But not to the case rather to the bedroom wall on the hinge side of the door in order to allow the case to open. And close without binding now to create a lip for the shelves we attach narrow strips of wood along each front edge while phil. And arlene assembled the second display case i move up to the bedroom to remove the old closet doors i use a utility knife to cut through the paint. And caulk at the edge of the door casing which also has to be removed a putty knife slipped behind the casing protects the wallboard while i use a flat bar to pry the casing off i also use a pry bar to remove the old door stop bo are you've been busy i have been busy up here. But here's the problem not a problem. But just a situation we took off the casing around the door because we had to have that flat. Now what we're left with is this kind of ugly joint here. And this unfinished wallboard. So i want to put this flat molding on here. And you came just in time arlene attaches the molding with a nail gun after giving it a coat of paint we're ready to install our first display case all right let's stop just just a second here phil done a couple of things i've  extended some lines around onto the casing here of this trim we put up earlier showing the location of the old hinge mortise. And i put a couple of pieces of plywood down here thin to act as shims i want to get this up off the carpet okay. So just bring it in lift it up tip it forward on top of the shims we rest the bookcase on the shims. And i transfer the hinge marks from the door casing to the shelving unit we lay the bookcase on the floor. And phil attaches the hinges. Then we hang the door once it's in place arlene completes the job by nailing the remaining decorative moldings plinth blocks. And rosettes to the wall okay guys has turned out really nice you know we started this morning with a couple of plain closet doors. And now you got a closet gallery looks great ron a swinging exhibit i think we'll call it that the doors dress up the safir's guest room without sacrificing space they're practical.

Now i'm on my way to troop texas to visit dennis. And kimberly stevens oh man you're going to have a jungle gym village out here when you finish that's what we're hoping for you know one thing i really like you've already got the safe play surface down here with the pe grabel got plenty of that. So what's your thinking here this is about where you want to put the second one yes it is okay are we going to build this from scratch bu build it from a kit have to buy the lumber additional. And the slides also separate okay. So we would have get the accessories. And the hardware in the kit right can you've got that already yes we do in the lumber yes we do let's go we ready our play set requires a bit of construction we're going to build a two-story structure with a tube slide. And other accessories connected to the upper level. Now before we start let me show you the kit that we're going to be using today this is actually the unit that we're going to build. And this kit like most provides the accessories. And all the hardware here's a tip for you separate the hardware out to start with put the light kind in it piles like this. And using a muffin tin is a great way to separate out the small parts this kit also has a cutting list right here. So the first thing we're going to do is start cutting some wood 23. And a/4 using the cut list as a guide we measure. And mark each piece of wood speed we're going to just measure. And mark these one at a time all right. Now take the speed square if you would draw us a nice st straight line across there dennis. And kimberly take turns with the circular saw running the base of the saw along the edge of the speed square assures a straight cut with all the lumber cut we can begin assembly we're first going to put together two nearly identical frames which could be thought of as the front. And back of the playet we snap chalk lines on the concrete patio to create a fullsize plant with this we can see the exact location for each piece of lumber. Then we just lay the boards on top of the lines all right this is the beginnings of our first frame right here. So we're going to temporarily attach this together. Now we temporarily attach the frames together by first drilling pilot holes. Then driving in four stainless screws at each joint okay guys we're going to flip this over. Now we have one more brace to put on the other side we secure the joints with carriage bolts washers. And nuts finally it's time to raise the frame. So we can can continue the assembly's push it up. So that it's vertical okay kim put the level up there let us know when it's plum or vertical okay a little bit more more which way out this way mhm okay no got it in in in right there right there okay everybody hold on once plum we temporarily hold the frames in place by clamping them to brac which are attached to stakes driven into the ground. Now we're going to hook these together with six pieces of 2x6 starting right down here on the bottom okay guys grab that in same thing here. Now we're going to drill the pilot holes. And then we're going to put the screws in first. Then we'll bat later we attach our first two boards to the sides of each frame connecting them together on the bottom. Then we'll attach two more boards across the top of the frame. And two at the midpoint in addition we're going to install two joists running through the middle of the frames these will support the deck boards that we'll attach later on okay race number two okay what a team over there huh i feel like we're framing out of house here big project [music] [applause] is well we put all of our cross supports in you can see that we've got a really sturdy structure here. Now took a little break. Now we're going to come back. And stabilize this there's always a danger of one of these playsets tipping. So to prevent that from happening we're going to put some heavy stakes around the bottom right here we secure the stakes to the frame with 3-in screws. Then kimberly. And i climb up top to begin installing the decking we're attaching the deck across all four supports or joist with galvanized deck screws using a carpenter's pencil as a spacer leaves just enough distance between the boards to allow water. And small debris to fall through with the deck in place we begin installing the walls or sidings again using galvanized screws you ready what we've gotten all of the siding on our uple level up there. Now we're putting it on the bottom down here same process. But i want to show you a little  little trick here sometimes if you're working by yourself. And it's hard to hold the board you  as you're getting it in position to screw it you can use a clamp like this just to secure it where you want it. So this case flush with the top. Then you can let go with both hands. And go ahead. And put the screws in with the playet frame decking. And walls complete dennis. And i are going to attach a small wooden frame we've just built this is the landing for a pirates ladder one of the several accessories that came with the kit we attach the ladder to the top railing with a couple of eyebolts the bottom of the rope ladder is attached to the frame with heavyduty staples to make sure the tension is tight with the ladders attached dennis fills in the landing. And covers the frame with peak gravel well this is our second accessory here the climbing rope it attaches to the upper part of the structure just same way the pyat ladder did with a long eyebolt. And a nut which we will. Now tighten down okay kim give it a try i'll give you 10 seconds to get up here come on go ahead at least it's strong enough huh yeah hang on it it'll help me. Now every two-story playhouse requ requ ires a suitable set of front steps in this case it's going to be a ladder we'll make the rails out of two 2x4s. And to be sure the holes are spaced accurately will clamp them together. And drill through both at the same time the rungs are short pieces of 1 and8 in dowel which came with a kit simply pound them through. And secure them in place with screws we attach the ladder to the playset. And now it's time for the grand finale well there are slides. And then there are slid slides. Now this tubular slide was purchased as an accessory to the playet. And we're going to roll it into position here. And then we'll attach it to the main frame kimberly places the bottom of the slide into the p gravel. Then dennis. And i bolt the top onto the frame. Now no playhouse would be complete without a roof. So dennis attaches a ridge beam to support an awning that came with the kit we drape the awning over the beam. And attach it with screws. And fender washers finally it's time for me to do what i came here for no not build an outdoor playet play on one wasen this is a great house call thanks for having me down i just want to ask one thing can i come back.

And play on this a little bit someday dad definitely water that's discharged from your downspouts can saturate the ground near your basement wall or foundation. Now over time that can cause settling. And cracking a very expensive proposition. So the idea is to carry that water away from the foundation here are three very simple ways to do that this is a splash block its job is to carry away discharged water this version is installed by removing the elbow. And slipping on the extender it's held in place with a couple of screws the clip holds the extension up. And out of the way when it's time for mowing or raking. And finally there's the accordion version the kids will love this one it slips over the elbow. And also attaches with screws each end has a differen size connector the unused connector is cut off this extender is flexible enough to route water clear of shrubs or flower beds. So remember downspout plus water plus foundation equals trouble.

But there's one thing that's missing. And that's right up here where the wall meets the ceiling it's crown molding. So right. Now we're going to put some in. And you're going to be amazed at how easily it goes the molding i'm using today is manufactured by creative crown molding. And available through their network of distributors it's made of high density polystyrene foam the surface is very smooth. And the detail is crisp. And clean because the material is lightweight it can be easily installed by one person. And best of all requires no nails or fasteners of any kind completely eliminating the need to locate wall studs to begin the installation i cut a 45 degree miter on the end of one molding section i can make this cut either by moving the miter saw table to the 45 degree position. And setting the molding vertically or by tilting the blade to a 45 degree bevel. And laying the molding flat on the saw bed today i'll be cutting with the material in the vertical position rather than using nails the crown is going to be held in place with caulk this material from sherwin-williams is a paintable siliconized acrylic latex sealant that immediately bonds the material in place. And cleans up easily with water i cut the nozzle off leaving an opening of about an eighth of an inch in diameter. Then use the built-in tool in the caulking gun to puncture the seal at the base of the nozzle there are two ways to apply the caulk i can lay a bead about the size of a small drinking straw near the edge of the top. And bottom of the molding when the section is placed on the wall the excess sealant squeezes out of the joint it's. Then cleaned off with this caulk removal tool any remaining sealant is wiped away with a damp cloth the second method is to place the bead of sealant about a quarter inch away from the edge set the molding in position. And press firmly with the palm of my hand in this case none of the sealant squeezes out. And an additional bead of caulk is added where the molding meets the ceiling. And wall i've removed the excess with my finger. And clean away any remaining material with a damp cloth it's a good idea to stop occasionally rinse the cloth wring out most of the water. And then continue quite surprisingly i found it unnecessary to use a tape measure for this project each wall requires two sections of molding i cut a 45 degree miter on the end of the second piece. And set it into position making sure that the tip of the miter is fully into the corner. Then i mark the spot where the two pieces meet this is a straight cut on the saw with the miter indicator set at zero normally it would be awkward to install conventional nailed on crown molding behind this built-in corner cabinet in this case though it's easily slipped into place. And firmly attached to the wall. And ceiling in a matter of seconds applying spackle to the ends of the butt joints before installation ensures that there will be a strong bond front to back that will prevent the joint from moving as the two pieces of molding are pressed together excess spackle squeezes out the front it's easily removed either with a plastic card or the caulk removal tool this spackle has a dry time indicator it goes on pink. But turns white when it's dry i like to fold my sandpaper into thirds before using it this makes the sandpaper pad stiffer yet pliable enough to conform to the molding profile rolling the sandpaper into a small cylinder allows me to get into the curved sections sealant is applied to each mitered end here too where the sections are pressed together any excess squeezes out it can be easily smoothed out with a finger. And cleaned up with a damp cloth [music] bright white. And the surface is perfectly smooth one coat of high quality water-based paint is usually all that's required applying masking tape to the wall. And ceiling allows the molding to be painted in place without any mess however i think painting the molding before installation is easier. And quicker once i get familiar with the process the project moves along surprisingly fast there's no noise mess or frustration a room like this can be completed in a couple of hours most often without the need to move the furniture this new. And improved high density polystyrene molding from creative crown is extremely stable. And does not expand or contract eliminating the possibility of future gaps in the joints the material also has a class a fire rating. And is made right here in america. Now that completes the room. And can you believe how easy it was from plane to classic in a couple of hours thank you good morning folks hi ron how are you good how are you ron how are you both yeah what a beautiful house this is i think it looks like an old farmhouse here the house was originally built in 1732. Really. And we moved in a little over two years ago oh it's gorgeous yeah i understand you've got a drainage problem yes yeah once you show me what's going on sure well when we bought the house the house did not have any gutters jim quickly pointed out that the water just pours from the roof creating among other things a rotted porch. So our first task is to figure out the slope of the eaves which tells us where the water naturally flows this two dollar item called a line level attaches to a string allowing us to create a level as long as we need it in this case 36 feet let me know when it's level. Now okay it looks level this is how much out of level right here this distance the roof is at this end compared to that end. But we can use that to our advantage a gutter attached to this long portion of porch roof will be naturally sloped carrying rain water toward one end. And eventually into a downspout all gutters must slope at least one quarter inch for every 10 linear feet to provide proper drainage this section of the roof on the other hand is nearly level. So we strike a level reference line. Then a second mark one quarter inch below the line to indicate the correct slope this portion of gutter will have a 90 degree turn or elbow on each end to determine the proper length for the straight section we hold the elbows in place. And mark their ends from this mark we subtract one quarter inch to allow room for the seams that we'll install later okay jim put it on the quarter inch mark there all right. And 67. Rain gutters are made of aluminum copper plastic even wood. But aluminum seems to be the most popular variety probably because it's inexpensive. And easy to install if you go out to buy them you'll usually find them in 10 foot sections like this they're measured. And cut to length. And then hooked together with special connectors show you more about that in a second right. Now let's cut this first section we had 67 inches up there take the tape measure measure down from this end make a mark at 67 inches. Then use a combination square to carry that line all the way around the gutter. Now we're ready to cut heavy duty tin snips are the best tool to use for this job. And there is a technique start at the top. And cut down the face of the gutter first. Then make the second cut down the back finally crease the gutter. And make the third. And final cut across the bottom careful. Now these are razor sharp edges we'll use hanging brackets to attach the gutter to the edge of the ease the manufacturer suggests placing brackets about six inches from each end. And then every 18 to 24 inches we. Then snap the brackets into place. And head up to the roof to mount the gutters we'll drive a screw through each bracket. And into the face board on the eaves to the last section of gutter will connect it downspout while janine holds the gutter in place i mark the location of the downspout hole this sleeve will connect the downspout to the gutter. Now to install it we have to cut a square hole in the bottom of the gutter those are the lines that we just drew for position we can actually use this sleeve as a temp that we'll just lay it on top. And trace the outline with the pencil in order to cut out the downspout opening we'll first make a punch mark at each corner. Then janine will drill starter holes. And cut the opening using the jigsaw when she's finished i file the edges smooth i don't know we want to put some sealant on next we apply a silicone sealant to the lip of this downspout connector a nice healthy bead. And place it into the cutout. And we'll drop that right down in there press it into place janine secures the downspout connector with short sheet metal screws since this will be the last gutter section in the run we'll need to install an end cap the cap is slipped into place. Then the edges are crimped to hold it securely with the downspout sleeve in place we'll hang the gutter with the gutter attached to the face board okay janine. And i measure the length for our downspout 75 okay good. Now the two ends on a piece of downspout may look the same. But actually they're not one end is tapered like this one. So that it will slip into the end of the next section. Now when you're cutting down spout always cut off the larger end never cut off the taper. And when you're installing it make sure that the large end is up. And the tapered end is down here's why if the large end faces down water will leak out through the joint. But if the large end faces up water will flow past the joint without leaking it's time to assemble the downspout. And do a test fit okay -oh this is something i hadn't counted on the bottom is hitting the concrete down here okay the solution here is to cut some wooden spacers from 2x4 lumber aluminum mounting straps are. Then screwed to the spacers. And attached to the posts with screws. Now we can slip the downspout assembly over the connector. And secure it in place with screws. Then we fold the aluminum mounting straps around the downspouts. And attach them with screws our last step is to connect the straight sections of gutter to each other. And the corner angles using this two inch strip of aluminum called a seamer it overlaps the joints. And fills in the quarter inch gap we left earlier the joints are made watertight by applying a heavy bead of sealant on the inside we'll let you do it guys let the sealer dry overnight. And then tomorrow take a garden hose. And put it in this end of the gutter check to make sure the water is flowing this way. And going into the downspout okay. And then it's not leaking at the joints. And you've got this gorgeous maple tree right here unfortunately it's going to dump a lot of leaves into these gutters. So i put up some leaf guards okay all the way around especially on this end it was a pleasure working with you you are wonderful with the hand tools thanks a lot ryan oh you're very welcome jim all the best to you thank you. And guys enjoy the gutters thank you [music],https://youtu.be/wEr-2seuYjQ?t=68,"['What type of material is used for crown molding?', 'How does caulk work in installing crown molding?', 'Why is it necessary to use spackle when installing crown molding?', 'What is the purpose of a seamer in gutter installation?', 'Can gutters be installed without a downspout?']"

And their gas log set it all began when in order to like this fireplace you have to stick your hand in the fireplace to light it okay that's no big deal that is a big deal do you remember the last time you said you draw your hair off the hand that's scared to wee-wee out of me oh is the gas still on i guess we can say lynn that was a point well made. So what's the moral of this story well i guess you could say it's that when your wife suggests you might want to update your gas log set to one that doesn't require you to put your hand inside to light it you should listen i did. And that's why i'm going to replace this gas log set with one that's state of the art i start by shutting off the gas to the fireplace. Then remove the artificial logs [music] great next i disconnect the gas line remove the old burner [music] last of all clean out the firebox [music] well the fireplace is all cleaned out. And i'm about to put in my new gas log set it has three components the burner the logs. And this wireless remote control more about this a little bit later on right. Now i want to start by putting in the burner. And attaching it to the bottom of the firebox the first step is to apply pipe thread sealant. Then attach the gas supply line to the burner. And snug the connection up tightly this system has remote control electronic ignition the small receiver simply plugs into the control box next i set the burner in position use a masonry bit to drill holes into the brick on the bottom of the firebox. And finally put in masonry screws to secure the burner in place well the long the log it's installed i've attached the gas line. Now i want to check to see if there are any leaks. So i'm going to turn the gas back on i'm going to take this bottle of soapy water just dishwashing detergent. And water here. And i'm going to spray it on all the connections. And fittings down here. Now if there were a leak i'd see some fairly substantial soap bubbles hopefully i won't find any. Now for what is probably going to be the most fun part of this job putting the actual logs on the burner. Now these are made of concrete. And they have to go in a very specific way. But it's easy because the bottoms of the logs have holes. And the burner down here has pins. So all i've got to do is match them up foreign well the burner's installed the logs are in place. But what comes next is what's going to make this look like a convincing wood burning fire it's called an accessory kit. And it's an option from the manufacturer of this log set empire comfort systems let me show you how it works first i sprinkle small blackened coals that look like remnants of earlier fires next i drop in a few of these ash coated coals for added realism. Then place some small partially burned pieces of wood around the base of the logs all of these materials of course are non-combustible finally small pieces of rock wool are placed over special ports in the burner when the log set is operating these tufts of rock wool will glow like hot coals pretty convincing isn't it. And you know the best thing of all i can turn that fireplace off. And on from right here in my easy chair using this remote control. And this is also a thermostat by pre-setting the room temperature i want this will automatically turn the log set on. And off keeping the room adjust the temperature i want it well that's it from fireplace theater join us next time for tales of the hand iron to view today's projects again visit ron,https://youtu.be/wEr-2seuYjQ?t=813,"['What is the main reason why the author replaced his gas log set?', 'How does the wireless remote control work with the log set?', 'What are the steps involved in installing a new burner?', 'Why is it important to check for leaks when installing a gas log set?', 'What is an accessory kit and how does it enhance the appearance of the fireplace?']"

And machines to build to fix to improve we're known as do-it-yourselfers home improvement fans fix it fanatics inventors at our core though we're all makers. So let's jump in. And make something hi i'm ron hazelton welcome to the show. And what a show we've got today first we'll build some simple. But very decorative wall panels that can transform just about any room. Then will'll construct a cat tree designed by an expert it's a perfect palace for a feline friend next i'll demonstrate a new tool that makes it unbelievably quick to change from drilling to driving. And finally some timely tips on how to protect exterior wood fences furniture. And accessories. Now this is going to be fun. So grab a toolbox. And let's get started well today i'm headed to davis california to visit john. And marcy [music] nrom well it's obvious you guys have got something in mind here because you've already begun to paint why don't you kind of tell me what the effect is that you're going for here well what we thought is we have the two colors here. And we were going to put a wallaper border up at the top there. And then come with some framing on the wall that we could either paint a contrasting color or put wallpaper in as well i'm thinking we might want to have one more element in here to separate the lower part of the wall from the upper part i suggest to marcy. And john that we add a strip of chair rail molding. Now i find it can be a bit difficult to imagine how borders moldings. And panels will look on a wall. So we decide to test our ideas first before we commit to past. And nails first marcy. And john temporarily tape up a portion of the wallpaper border they plan to use. Then we use wide masking tape to simulate the frame molding. And chair rail well what do you think i like it actually looks good to me too yeah yeah. Now that we've agreed on where everything will go we make measurements lower one is six. And 3/4 take down the tape. And draw level. And plum or vertical lines showing where each piece of molding will go all right mary start with the top mark. Now the edge of the level has got to go on the mark. And you have to adjust the level up. And down till this bubble is right between those two lines okay that looks pretty good good okay with all of our layout done we turn our attention to the wallpaper border the border is prepasted. But marcy prefers to use the paste activator rather than just water to guarantee a good bond we apply the activator with a roller. Then fold the pasted sides together a process called booking leaving the pasted surfaces in contact with each other for a few minutes before application ensures the adhesive is thoroughly moistened. And ready to go strips are unfolded positioned on the wall. And pressed in place using a wallpaper squeegee marcy trims the ends using a wide putty knife in a very sharp knife meanwhile i step outside. And start setting up the saw for the molding we'll soon be cutting. Now what i've done here is make a work support system for the power miter saw the reason is that we're going to be cutting several pieces of molding to exactly the same length here's how it's going to work first of all let's say we want to cut a piece 42 in long i' measure down from the blade 42 in right here. And then take this piece of wood which i call a stop block put it right on that mark clamp it in place. And for my molding i just simply set it on here slide the end of the molding up against the stop block. Then go ahead. And make my cut before we start cutting in nest though we paint all of our molding prep painting will save us a lot of tedious work later on [music] okay guys that's great. So these are all the vertical pieces okay cut this is the chair rail we're going to be putting this up next it'll have to have miters on the end too where it goes to the inside corners they'll be cut something like this they there'll be one on each end they'll go together like this. And then give us a nice finished inside look all the horizontal pieces of molding will be nailed into wall studs marcy locates. And marks the studs using an electronic stud finder okay. Now you see where the wall studs are you i'll tell you what i'll put the first nail in right here okay you when you're ready a pneumatic nail gun is by far the fastest. And easiest way to attach molding. And we don't have to worry about dents from a missed hammer blow air nailers can be rented or purchased these days you can find an entire system for under $150. Now on this piece we were able to catch three studs john on the verticals there are no studs. So we're going to have on some construction adhesive here. So i usually like put just a dot every few inches on this we'll still nail these vertical pieces. But just to keep them in place until the glue dries the real holding power comes from the glue 59 half marcy wants a frame above the fireplace in the center of which she plans to hang a circular mirror hey john. Now these are corner blocks or plinth blocks going to set right here nice thing about these jn is that they you don't have to  cut any miters with these. So lay this in okay john. So just drop this in here. Now with the molding up we fill the nail holes with spackling our fingertips seem to work best for this well that's why you stand down john let me know if it's in the center here while john. And i have been installing the molding marcy has been wallpapering the inside of the panels she cuts the strips oversiz. And forces out any air bubbles with a squeegee making sure the pattern matches. And then trims off the excess with the sharp knife well i got to tell you i think this adds a lot of dimension a lot of detail a lot of depth of this wall i think. So too this is a project that i've thought about for a long time. But we would never have done it in this much detail by ourselves you know what i love about this project with a few strips of molding. And a little little wallpaper you can take a room from plain to fancy contemporary to traditional whatever look or feel you want to create it's just that [music],https://youtu.be/cMHlPyuX3ko?t=0,"['What is the main theme of the content?', 'Who are the hosts of the show?', 'What type of project will be built first?', 'How do the hosts apply wallpaper border?', 'What tool does John use to support his power miter saw?']"

Now let's talk about home improvement for pets you know those canaries dogs. And cats that we all live with especially cats you know they can be really finicky. So i thought i'd try to design a cat tree that they would just love this is it right here. Now i'm going to have some pals coming over in a little while from the humane society to check this out i'll be here shortly. So we better get started. Now some folks feel that the cat trees that you buy in stores don't really have stable bases. So we're going to make ours with a very large. And heavy base out of 3/4 in plywood actually two layers of it. And we're going to hook these together by first gluing them. And then screwing them. So i'm going to apply the glue. And since we've got such a large surface here i'm going to roll it on with a paint roller take our second piece of plywood. And just put this right on top okay. Then i drill some counter sunk shank holes. And drive in a few screws. Now that's a sturdy base. Now we're going to put a lip all the way around the outside here all righty well there's the base. Now we're going to start on the apartment complex. Now cats love cozy spaces that they can crawl into. And out of. So we've designed kind of a two-story jungle gym here with plenty of entrances. And exits. Now for small to medium siiz cats you want these holes to be about 6 in in diameter. And so set up my compass here to be 3 ines which is half of that all right we'll put the sharp part on the cross line here. And draw ourselves a 6in diameter circle there we go. Now we're going to be cutting this out with a jigsaw. So i'm going to drill a starter hole just inside the line that we drew i'm going to drop that blade right into the starter hole. And cut this circle out well we've got all of our doorways cut those cats have got plenty of ways to get in. And out. Now we're going to begin to construct the box or should i say the kitty cottage. And we're going to be doing that by taking the sides top. And bottom. And putting them together with glue. And nails. So let's start by putting some glue on the side right [music] [music] here well our tower's finished that'll sit right inside the base just like that. Now experts tell us that cats like to perch scratch. And climb i'd say we've got the perch taken care of. Now we're going to deal with the scratch. And climb by covering all of this in carpet i've cut a piece here that drops right inside our base as you can see. And we're going to hold this in place with some staples. And there we go that carpet's not going to go anywhere next we attach carpet to the side. And top of the soon tobe kitty highrise well our carpet's on. But those cats are going to have kind of a tough time getting to that door right. Now aren't they. So we're going to have to cut a hole through the carpet. And the way to do that is to locate pretty much the center of the hole just by feel here it's about right there i would say. Then take the knife we're going to go all the way through. And we're going to cut out to the edge of the hole till the knife stops right there. And then make several sort of pie-shaped cuts like this wedges stopping at the edge of the hole always going back to the center i give each section a dab of construction adhesive fold them around the edge of the opening. Then staple them in place on the inside well we've got a great place for our feline friends to curl up inside. And perfect perch. Now we want to add a gymnastic element i'm going to take four pieces of pvc pipe. And create a frame that'll come up on all from all four corners right here to attach that at the top though i've got to put something into this hollow pipe piece of dowel i've mixed up some quick setting epoxy. And i'll spread it on the inside of the pipe there that's good. And then we'll take a piece of our dowel. And just slide this right inside these dowels also provide a solid core to which we can attach a piece of cil rope a favorite scratching material ron hey how are you i'm good how are you this is my friend jean from the humane society nice to meet you buddies here huh who we got we have in here this is tina. And turnip tina. And turnip hey guys these are two little kittens found in a dumpster in a dumpster mhm 10 days old we've come up with a time-saving way to wrap the rope around the pvc using my drill to spin the pipe while jean guides the rope into place excellent all right. So now we okay we're going to have it for you they're really impatient they're anxious to try this out out jean could you hand me that last one there sure we'll set this in place. And then if you can kind of align those marks up for me right there i'll put the screws in finally we join all our poles together by driving screws through the plastic pipe. And into the wooden dowels i inserted earlier okay on little guys let's see what we got for i think oh look look look she loves it she loves it wow [music] [laughter],https://youtu.be/cMHlPyuX3ko?t=431,"['What type of base is used to make a stable cat tree?', 'How are the doorways cut out in the cat tree design?', 'Why is carpet used on the sides and top of the cat tree?', 'What material is used for the scratching post?', 'How do you attach the rope to the PVC pipe frame?']"

But let me ask you this have you ever thought of going green using a natural product well just what is a natural product. And how well do they work right. Now there's no industry standard for natural cleaners one company though chloro has set their own standard by making their greenworks products from 99% natural materials including coconut lemon. And corn how well do natural cleaners work well i put them to the test i tried out the allpurpose cleaner the glass cleaner the bathroom cleaner. And the concentrate i put the all-purpose cleaner to work on countertops cooktop spills even the inside of the oven door it's seemed to work as well as most traditional cleaners i've used there was very little odor. And the smells i did detect were not at all offensive the brand clorox is practically synonymous with bleach however there is no bleach in any of the greenworks products including the bathroom cleaner it worked well on porcelain sinks chrome plumbing fixtures. And the tile walls in the shower the greenw works glass cleaner starts out a bit sudsy. But clears up quickly leaving a squeaky clean surface free from smears. And smudges the formula uses no ammonia or alcohol for floors i tried the concentrate. Now i don't recommend waterborne cleaners for wood floors. But the solution did a good job on the entryway marble tile the green works cleaners contain no phosphorus. And can be safely disposed of down the drain. So the next time you're choosing a cleaning product think about going natural it's good for your family.

And good for the environment. Now if you like me you use your drill as much for driving as you do for drilling especially if you're putting screws into hard material. Now what that usually means is that you first have to load the drill bit drill a hole remove the drill put in the driver bit. And then drive in the screw. Now that's not. So bad if you've only got to put in a couple of screws. But if you've got to drive a lot of them well it can be a real time waster. So i want to introduce you to a new tool it's called the twist lock drill. And drive system. And it can really save you a lot of time on this otherwise dual operation with the twist lock system you first insert a bit holder. And drill bit into the chuck. Then drill the pilot hole here i'm also making a counter sync in the same operation. Now instead of removing the drill bit i simply slip a driver bit holder over it place a screw on the magnetized tip. And drive it in another version of this system uses this keyless chuck within a chuck it accepts any standard round shaft drill for drilling any pilot or clearance hole. And uses the same slip-on bit holder. So that's it from drilling to driving with just a,https://youtu.be/cMHlPyuX3ko?t=903,"[""['What is the main problem with using a drill and driver separately?', \n ['How does the twist lock drill system work?', \n ['What are the benefits of using a twist lock drill system?', \n ['Can you use any standard round shaft drill with the twist lock chuck?', \n ['Is the twist lock drill system suitable for drilling large numbers of screws?']""]"

And as the wood dries out it contracts it's this continuous expanding. And contracting as the wood gets wet. Then dry that causes it to crack warp. And splinter also ultraviolet rays from the sun break down wood cells. And can deteriorate wood. And finally believe it or not rainwater can actually wash the color out of certain woods like redwood. And cedar in much the same way that i'm washing the coffee out of this sponge. So that's why you need to seal or waterproof exterior wood. And keep it sealed fortunately that's pretty easy to do these days because there's a new type of wood waterproofer out there it can be applied to new pressure treated lumber as well as freshly cleaned dam amp lumber which means you can clean. And seal your wood in the same day waterproofers can be brushed on or they can be applied with a garden sprayer if sprayed on it's best to follow up with a brushing just to work the sealer well into the wood. Now sealers or waterproofers can be clear or tinted like this one as a matter of fact there are. So many tinted sealers available that you can create just about any kind of a effect that you want how often should you reseal well here's a simple test that you can do splash some water on the wood if it beads up like this you have protection if it soaks in like this example it's time to retreat to view today's projects again visit ronhazelton.com step-by-step home improvement tips when you need them let ron show you how to do it [music] yourself [music] sh,https://youtu.be/cMHlPyuX3ko?t=1016,"['What type of damage can water cause to exterior wood?', 'How does ultraviolet rays affect wood cells?', 'Can rainwater wash the color out of certain types of wood?', 'How often should sealers or waterproofers be reapplied?', 'What is a simple test to determine if a sealer is working effectively?']"

And ordered a couple of samples when the tiles arrived one of the first first things i noticed was how lightweight they were. So before we committed to putting up an entire room of these tiles i thought well why not put a couple up just to sort of get the effect. So here's one of the tiles right here. And i've cut some  masking tape i'm just going to roll this up here. So that the sticky side is out. And apply this to the back of the tile. And now what this is going to do is going to allow me to get an idea what these will look like like without putting any kind of permanent adhesive on the back. Now use the flat of my hand here push it up there i can begin to get some idea of how it's going to change the appearance of the room laying out the tile pattern typically involves using intersecting lines to find the center of the room. Then installing the tiles from there outward using the lines as guides to do that we measure each wall. Then locate. And mark the center point we do this on all four walls next i drive in a small finish nail on the mark loop one end of a chalk line over the nail move to the opposite wall locate the center mark there pull the line taut. And snap i repeat the process for the remaining two walls the point where the two chalk lines cross is the exact center of the ceiling it's also the original location of the chandelier however in this room the chandelier has been moved a bit to allow it to hang directly above the dining table i'd also like the chandelier to be in the exact center of a tile. So i offset the starting point to accommodate this the tools. And materials required for this installation are simple. And readily available because the polystyrene tiles are. So lightweight they can be installed using a hightech instant grab adhesive like this one i cut the tapered nozzle. So that it will produce a medium width bead using the built-in piercing tool on the caul gun i puncture the seal at the base of the nozzle. And then load the cartridge the adhesive is best applied in dimiz dabs spaced about 6 in apart i begin installation starting at the chalk line intersection aligning the edge of the tile with the lines on the ceiling once the tile is in position i press it firmly using the flat or palm of my hand putting up the full tiles goes quite quickly here's where having a second person to apply the adhesive can save time. And avoid a lot of trips up. And down the ladder it's important to make sure the tiles are pushed tightly together the corners are aligned. And that the edges follow the chalked guidelines to cut. And fit the tiles around the perimeter of the room i measure the distance from the last full tile to the wall or in this case the crown molding i make two measurements since the distances may not be the same. Then transfer those measurements to a tile align a straight edge with the marks. And cut through the tile using a utility knife a couple of tips here place a sheet of cardboard or other soft material on top of the workt this will reduce drag on the blade as it cuts through. And keep the blade sharper longer i find the utility knife with a snap off blade makes it quick. And easy to restore a sharp cutting edge making two or three passes with light pressure produces a clean smooth cut cutting out for electrical boxes can be easily done after the tiles are installed before taking the chandelier down i made sure to turn off the power at the circuit breaker panel now using a utility knife i can simply insert the blade carefully cut my way to the edge of the box. And then use the box as a [music] template there are a couple of ways to cut openings for for air conditioning or heating ducks one method is to measure the distance from adjacent tiles to the edges of the opening. And transfer those measurements to a tile to avoid drawing on the face of the tile i use painters masking [music] tape another approach is to place the tile in position. Then use the edge of the opening as a cutting guide [music] although the tile seams are barely visible they can be sealed with acrylic painter's caul cut the cartridge nozzle to provide an opening that's about an eighth of an inch in diameter this will reduce the likelihood of overfilling the joint smooth the caul with your finger. And clean up any excess with a damp cloth these tiles can be painted after installation or can be ordered prepainted from the supplier that's it f the elegance of an embossed ceiling in a matter of hours.

And at a very affordable cost an ideal do it yourself home improvement well today i'm headed out to studio city california i'm going to be visiting steve leo. Now steve loves to enter sweep stakes in contests what he lacks is a good mailbox to handle the huge volume of mail he receives every day. So we're going to build one. Now is this typical of the amount of mail you get every day actually it's lighter than normal i get. So much mail because i enter all those sweep steaks. And contest what i think we should do here steve is  design a custom mailbox for two reasons first of all i want to make sure your new mailbox is large enough to handle both the size. And the volume of mail that you're getting okay. So when it gets to be that big  i think we want to build it. So that it kind of blends in with your house great together steve. And i designed a wallmounted mailbox we'll craft it from solid wood. And it will consist of two main parts a frame. And a bin the bin will sit inside the frame. And be hinged at the bottom. So that it can open. And close have you used a table saw much before when i was in wood shop a long time ago that's the last time i used since this project will require accurate cross cuts on the table saw i decide to construct a simple accessory called a cradle it's a sort of wooden sled that will allow us to easily hold the wood in position as we cut we start with strips of wood called runners small pieces of double-sided carpet tape. And a bead of glue are placed on one side. Then the runners are set into the table saw grooves glue side up this is going to be the bottom of our cradle right here just a piece of plywood. So if you could take that edge over there steve. And i place the plywood down on the runners i want to set this down. So that the front edge of the plywood is just about even with the front of those stick there the double stick tape acts as a temporary clamp holding the runners to the bottom of the plywood. Then we turn the plywood over. And there's our rails. Now that positions the rails exactly where we want them okay. Now we nail the runners in place next we flip the cradle back over for a quick test i turn on the saw. And raise the blade. So that it cuts through the center of the cradle i stop the cut a few inches from the end next we apply glue to the edge of a 1x3 set the wood on the rear edge of the plywood to me use a framing square to make sure it's perfectly perpendicular to the saw blade. And clamp it in position. So steve if you grab that piece of 1x3 over there. And let me just turn this up on edge carefully we turn the cradle over. And secure the fence with finish nails finally we place a second fence on the front of the cradle good warmup for the mailbox huh a piece of cake by the time we get to the all right. So let's just try this out steve okay lay the board up against this edge flip on the saw hold both sides this gives us a very accurate cut. And a lot of control. So we're going to use this a lot this afternoon all right all right this is something i made up to to go with our saw cradle right here this is called i call it a stop block this attachment can be clamped anywhere along the rear edge of the fence. And once in place will enable us to duplicate pieces of lumber cut to exactly the same length ready to cut [music] yes. Now this is one of the sides to your mailbox  what we're going to do is we're going to cut this corner off right here just it's sort of a detail as we've seen the rear fence of a table saw cradle can be used to make very accurate straight cuts by temporarily attaching an auxiliary fence the cradle can also be used to make very precise angle cut that's good. Now if we've done this right these should be just about perfect matches looks exact with all of our pieces cut we can begin to assemble our mailbox starting with the frame the l-shaped top. And bottom sections are made up of two pieces of wood steve brushes water resistant glue along the edge of one board i hold the second board in place as steve attaches them with nails. So here's our top okay here's our bottom. And these are the sides that we cut earlier next we attach the ends to the top. And bottom of the mailbox. And our frame assembly is complete well i've been sanding off our frame right here steve's been over cutting out the the last few remaining pieces actually. And those are for the bin that's going to go inside this area right here. And here are good job very nice job okay. So this is the bottom this is the front of the bin right here. And this is the back this is where your mail is actually going to go right here. And this unit right here was going to fit inside that opening [music] right again we use glue. And nails to attach the sections of the bin [music] together my thought is this is the bin that's going to hold your mail that we hinge this on the bottom. So that it'll it'll flip out this way we attach the bin to the frame with a piano hinge while steve holds the hinge in position i install the screws with the mailbox complete i pl down the edge of the bin to ensure a smooth opening. And closing well here's our handle which we made out of just a scrap piece of that redwood that looks nice clamp the handle in place. Then drive in the screws from the inside of the bin good since it's a tight fit for the drill we use a drill bit extension to give us a better angle finally we install an address frame. And house numbers with a bit of clear silicone all right we did it steve has decided he wants the top of his mailbox right here. And i've drawn a level line. So we're going to go ahead. Now and start to mount this the first thing we want to do steve is to drill some clearance holes in the top. And bottom. So i've got these marked for you here. So why don't you go ahead. And drill those intersection here. Now we want to do is transfer the location of these holes up here in the wall i hold the mailbox on the level line. And center it. Then steve passes a small masonry bit through the mailbox holes. And marks their location on the stucco next we enlarge the holes with a bigger masonry bit. And hammer in plastic anchors we put the mailbox up. And install pan head screws through the mailbox. And into the anchors finally steve applies a coat of exterior house paint all he has to do. Now is wait for those lucky sweep stakes forms to arrive big difference from this to this very big difference i love the way it looks. And it it will actually hold all of my mail that's the best part about it too whether steve's new mailbox brings him good fortune or not i'm sure he'll feel like a winner whenever he opens it knowing that it didn't just come from a store.

But from his own two hands. Now when you've got a couple of young kids around the house like i do this kind of damage is well not all that surprising what i think happened here is that my daughter found it was a lot of fun to swing on this gate. And her weight simply pull that toggle right out of the wall. Now i need to make a repair here that's strong enough to hold the new toggle when i put it back in again before starting i head out to my van to get a couple of tools. And the material i'll need to make the [music] repair. Now this is a scrap piece of halfin wallboard it's the same material the wall is made of the first thing i'm going to do is to cut a small patch out of this that's slightly larger than the damaged area right here to cut wallboard i make one or two passes over the paper front with a sharp knife break the board. Then score or cut the paper on the [music] back i always like to keep a few board scraps around just for repairs like this next i place the patch over the damaged area. And trace the outline onto the wall i also mark the top. Now this is a wallboard saw you notice there's a really nice sharp point right here. So to get this started all i've really got to do is place this on the line kind of give it a little bit of a twist. And a push it goes right in [music] well that's just about a perfect fit. And when you think about it well it really has to be because i used the patch as a template to draw the outline. And then i put this arrow up here. So that when i put this back in it's in the same position as it was when i drew the [music] outline next i app apply some glue to the back of the patch lay a piece of quin plywood on top. And attach it by driving screws through the wallboard. And into the wood. Now this long screw right here is going to be a handle. So i'm put a little bit of glue on this backer board think of those as is kind of tabs all right. Now i'm going to slip the whole patch up inside the hole i'll grip that nail. And secure this patch in place by running two screws through the wall. And into that piece of plywood in the back with the patch secured in place i fill the gaps around the edges with joint [music] compound after letting it dry. And sanding it smooth i touch up the paint next i reposition the gate post drill a locator hole bore a larger halfin opening insert the bolt screw on the toggle push it into the wall. And [music] tighten well there we go good as new actually this is a little bit better than new because that toggle is. Now resting on the plywood. And not just on the wallboard. But i am going to have a little chat with my daughter see if i can't find something else for her to swing,https://youtu.be/2AGgODGYsoQ?t=862,"['What type of material was used to make the original gate post?', 'How did the author repair the damaged area in the wall?', 'What is the purpose of using plywood as a backing board?', 'Why is it important to use joint compound to fill gaps around edges?', 'What happened to the toggle when the gate post was repaired?']"

So to prepare for that we first cover the carpet with plastic drop claws. Then mask the windows door casings. And baseboards while we're prepping the room david. And scott are painting a section of drywall with three different shades of burgundy that gwen. And derek have picked as possible colors for the room what do you think you have a choice here yes definitely the first one this one the left yes okay rich all right once we take a look at the colors in daylight we shut the blinds. And turn on a lamp to get an idea of how the colors will look at night okay man jack you are easy to entertain all right. So we're gna prime this may not look like primer because it's got color in it. But it is. And we've we've tinted this primer because we've going from a pretty dramatic  very light colored wall over here actually stark white to a color that's very dark. So to help us get better coverage on the final coat we've added a little color to the primer which is something you can do anytime you're going to make a a drastic change like that right using edging tools derek. And gwen get to work priming the edges. And corners of the walls i generally try to keep the pan m close to the work however be careful not to step in it which i have done when. And derek finished painting the edges. And now we're about to roll on the rest of the [music] primer.

Now if you're going to be rolling paint on walls like these here's a tip that'll save you time. And give you more uniform results instead of putting your paint in a pan like this put it in a 5 gallon bucket in this case we've got two gallons to put in here. Now if there's any color variation between these two gallons it's going to go away when i mix them together everything's mixed. Now we're going to drop this over the side of the bucket this is called a painter screen. And instead of going back to a paint pan. And dipping our roller in that we're going to dip this directly into the 5 gallon bucket submerge it like that roll off the excess on the screen. And we're ready to paint this means you have far fewer stops to refill a roller pan like that. And as long as you keep this bucket up close to the wall you have to spend almost no time reloading place the fully charge roller near the top of the wall. And make one long stroke from top all the way down to the bottom. And back up again recharge the roller move over about one roller's width. And repeat that process after you've made three or four stripes. Then come back. And blend them together with long vertical strokes going from the top all the way down to the bottom try this technique it'll save you time. And you'll avoid what painters call holiday days that's the spots in the wall where you just didn't get quite enough paint all,https://youtu.be/gJoCo2R1X-U?t=274,"['What is a 5-gallon bucket used for in painting?', 'How does mixing two gallons of paint together affect color variation?', 'What is a painter screen and how is it used?', 'Why is it recommended to keep the roller close to the wall during painting?', 'What is meant by ""holiday days"" in painting?']"

But occasionally they require a little hands-on practice i don't feel like i'm doing this right all the way down oh oh no look what ceiling theil oops look what i just did i saw gwen's mark up there. And i said i got to match that there you. Now you come down. So you're going to have that white stripe in between [music]  you thought i had a hole of it think i'm going to do yours. And mine well she was really quick to give up that roller wasn't she you're unloading the roller. Now you've already got enough paint on the wall all the way up. And down all the way down all the way down there you go top to bottom that's it. And then back up. And all the way down. And keep working your way across the wall.

And scott work off camera hey ron we finished with the primer you did yeah that was pretty fast finished yeah it was pretty quick okay. So while that's drying  let's go ahead. And start putting some of the furniture together. So i've got the first piece right here this is actually well there's a picture of it right here you can see this is a bookcase. And i guess i'm going to be forced to read the directions here. Now everybody pay attention place the right side panel a on the clean cardboard inside the box or on a carpeted surface with the holes pointing upward screw cam connectors j into the holes for the permanent shelves as shown in figures one8 wow whatever how you coming gwen i think i'm doing it right oh gwen you put them in back backwards i put him in back no you didn't this is the top the screws are pointing good all right. Now is there a front or back to this we need one more cam somewhere is there se one down anyone no a man maybe it fell on the ground oh here's one here it is you see it go you see david has read the directions i'm become an expert at this. Now yeah this is really nice. Now here here is the back this is e8 in plywood okay see those little little groove right there just slide it in just slide it in all the way up okay it should be flush with the top there right yes we are here's the thing on this glen this is a variable speed drill the further you pull this back the faster it goes. So very slowly the most enjoyable part is going to be what we're doing right. Now today go when i said slow gwen took me at my [music] word okay screw just fli it over okay this we should have a bookcase all right voila there it is there it is all right guys want to carry that up to the garage okay all right all right i'll supervise all right that way this way up the hills,https://youtu.be/gJoCo2R1X-U?t=425,"['What type of furniture was being assembled in the video?', 'How did the person assemble the bookcase?', 'What is the variable speed drill used for?', 'Why was it important to follow the directions carefully?', 'Where were the bookcases carried after assembly?']"

So little yet have such a dramatic effect on your home as paint. And the nice thing is you know if you do it mm. And i know we were joking about this later. But if you don't like it let do it over again that's true i'm not suggesting that that's going to be the case here while painting is going on indoors i've moved back outside to start prepping our furniture for finishing i drive a couple of nails into the edges of the bookshelves. And place them on a pair of 2x4s. So see. Now we can let these nails rest on these 2x4s. And even though we could have wet finish on both sides of this no part of the shelf is touching anything. So that allows us to kind of work a little bit faster i have to wait for one side to dry that's a good idea. Now the shelves  the these cabinets are made of birch. And alder it has a tendency to splotch a little bit when you stain it. So we're going to put this material on here this is called a pre-stained wood conditioner. And all we have to do is brush this on it's kind of almost water likee. So you guys just go ahead. And start start putting this on we're going to put it on both sides okay. And then we can just flip this right over see that's w on the other side. But it's not touching okay yeah is this is that brilliant yeah i never would have thought about that i learned that from somebody everything i know i've learned from somebody else tell you after applying the wood conditioner we wipe off the excess with cloths. And let it dry. Now we're ready for our finished stain this is a stain that's been added to a finish or coating. So it's sort of suspended in the coating. And again because of this kind of wood the birch. And the alder  it's going to go on with less spotting. And blotching it's important to apply the finish as quickly as possible to avoid leaving streaks. And lap marks. And then come back with nice long strokes like this okay once the finish dries we rub out the surface with fine steel wool to remove bubbles or trap dust particles moving the steel wool. And long strokes in the direction of the wood grain prevent scratching next we run a tack cloth over the shelves to pick up any residue. Then we'll apply a second coat of finish all,https://youtu.be/gJoCo2R1X-U?t=560,"['What type of paint has a dramatic effect on your home?', 'Why is it recommended to apply finish as quickly as possible?', 'What happens when you stain birch and alder wood?', 'How does pre-stained wood conditioner work?', 'What should be done after applying the second coat of finish?']"

And a top to protect food from the elements larger hopper feeders hold a greater amount of seed. And therefore require less refilling they attract blue jays nut hatches. And woodpeckers among others this is a platform or tray feeder food is spread across an open surface. And the feeder often has a roof to keep food dry this is the easiest feeder to fill. And attracts cardinals black cap chickies. And tufted ti mice a tube feeder is a tower of sorts with several ports. And purches the size of these ports. And perches determines the type of birds that we'll visit sometimes called a silo feeder it attracts a variety of finches place feeders where birds can easily see them since most birds find food by sight rather than smell put feeders in quiet areas. But make sure they're located where you can view them such as a kitchen dining or living room window. And choose a convenience spot that makes it easy for you to refill no matter what the weather position feeders close to the shelter of trees. And shrubs. So birds have a refuge while they wait their turn. But not too close otherwise squirrels will have a good jumping off point. And outdoor cats can more easily stalk select a location where cleanup is not an issue since there will be feathers seed shells. And droppings on the ground below keep it in mind the food that you put in your feeders will determine what kind of birds come visiting choose a blend that attracts desirable song birds.

And often i need to unplug an appliance before i can plug in my charger this clever device from snap power solves that problem by incorporating a usb charger port into the cover plate installation is simple i just remove the existing cover plate slip on the snap power unit. And replace the screws this built-in charger draws its power through these tabs that make contact with the terminal screws on the receptacle. Now i don't have to give up an outlet to charge my phone.

And make something hi i'm ron hazelton welcome to the show. Now today's program is about the rooms we live in. And the openings between them my house call takes me to a couple looking for a separation a separation of spaces that is. Then back here at my own place i find that widening the doorway to my living room has created a real problem with my hardwood floors two very interesting [music] challenges,https://youtu.be/9aUWQDn21Yo?t=0,"['What does it mean to be a maker?', 'How do DIYers approach home improvement projects?', 'What are some common problems caused by widening doorways?', 'Why is separating spaces important in a house?', 'How can widening doorways affect hardwood floors?']"

Now it seems to me that many home improvement projects start with a vision that would appear to be true for ben. And katherine morehead have theyve taken care of their share of projects since they bought their house a while back. And have their sight set on the next challenge katherine in particular has a very clear idea what she wants well we're trying to add a little separation. And a little bit of interest in the living room den area right. Now it's it's just a huge gap in a lot of the new homes that are going up you see these beautiful columns separating two rooms. And i thought why can't we do that here. Now i don't see any reason at all why ben. And catherine can't have exactly what they want i figure they just need a little bit of a jump start. So i head over to ridgefield to see about creating a bit of separation for my friends hey guys hi ron how arefi thanks thank you very much i love the rocks i guess that's where the ridge comes from theid here that's right. So these are the two rooms that you kind of want to separate a little bit yes you don't want a wall up here no we decide against a wall we like open space. But the problem is this this window this room was added afterward it looks this room over here was added yeah. And it looks like it's just bolted onto the house there's really no transition okay. So you think by making a up here like there's more of a division between these two rooms exactly. And give it a little interest a little details. So so what are the actual dimensions you're thinking of i was thinking about 40 in high. And perhaps 17 in wide 17 yeah that's very precise 17 in not 20 not 15 17 maring ers are always very precise that's good. Now i'm not doubting catherine's judgment. But just to make sure i construct a simple plywood mockup to help us visualize the dimensions maybe a little too close in little too much okay let me come into about here how does that look further in couple more inches in how about somewhere in this range maybe one more inch what do you think i you know honey you're the decision maker here. So okay i i like it well catherine's happy. So ben checks things out from his point of view i like this is,https://youtu.be/9aUWQDn21Yo?t=60,"['What type of separation are Ben and Catherine trying to create in their living room?', 'Why do many new homes lack columns separating two rooms?', 'How did the addition of a second room affect the design of the space?', 'What dimensions were Ben and Catherine thinking of for the separation?', 'Why did Ben construct a plywood mockup to visualize the dimensions?']"

Now these are the 2x4s you cut outside. And we're going to use these to make up a wall frame. So if you just kind of hang out of that for me i'm going to patch these together with some 3in screws sti this up okay. And if you' grab that piece of 2x4 right there okay. And set it right up on the top okay i'm going to have you put these in perfect excellent lay this right on here that'll give us the extra thickness we need the wall that we're connecting to is a little thicker than typical. So we're adding strips of 1x two to our frame to give us the added depth we'll need excellent okay. So there's our wall frame let going to sit right in here like that okay we attach the wall frame first to the existing wall. And then to the floor when it's secure we head out to the garage. And start cutting the drywall that will cover it first we score the paper on the face of the wallboard. Then stand the panel on edge break it along the score line. And finally cut the paper on the back excellent. Now we're just going to snap it back the other way like this okay there's your cut. So this is half inch wallboard here if you want to grab your  your screw gun right there just go ahead. And start putting this in all right start here mhm all right. Now we make it a real wall closed on both [applause] [music] sides okay [music] cine our next step is to attach this metal bead to protect the otherwise fragile edges. And give us sharp clean lines guys the only thing you got to remember here is try not to hit the corner cuz if you do we end up with a dent. And that not too pretty. So just take your time okay enjoy okay you ready. And we'll. Now have dual hammers or is it dueling hammers time for little taping okay done this before yes you have. So you're a taping v i'm the taper of the family oh well let's just dive right in. Then all right it's very nice catherine catherine is putting down what i call a bedding coat of joint compound we'll cover the joint with paper tape which i first dip in water. Then pull between my fingers to remove the excess moisture for my experience i found damp tape like this ad hears better if you want to place that. So the center of the tape is right on the seam okay again keep the knife flat. And you're pressing it in okay ben you're up ben uses joint compound to conceal the flanges on the metal corner bead. And blend it into the wall the compound we're using today will set in about 45 minutes. Then we'll apply a second coat. And when it's dry sand it smooth well we've got both of our knee walls in just finishing up the sanding on this one over here how's it going great it's going well looking good that's nice really nice okay well you've been busy doing that  i've been out cutting this ledge or shelf whatever you want to call it it's going to go on top here this is a piece of popler. And all i've done is sort of cut a notch out of it put a little bit of a round over on the edges here. And this will just slip right in here like that that's that looks great very nice touch that's not going to go anywhere huh. Now we're going to start trimming out the inside of your openings here with i guess you'd call it jam material all right. So let's start with the top piece right up here okay this kind of woodwork or mill work as it's often called adds interest. And detail to just about any room it can turn a wall from ordinary into [music] elegant [music] well i'd say ben. And katherine did a fine job without me. But now they're going to need my support hey hey hey look what i've got your new col oh wow at that  oh i think i made a little mistake think i'm a little too too big for the opening right here just a little seriously though you do have to decide what portion of this you want  top bottom middle what do you think i think the top because of all of the detail up there what do i think honey you think the top the top looks great to i love the way you two just agree on pretty much everything. So the column comes with a capital. And a base i'm going to stack the capital. And the base on top of each other ben i'm going to give you tape measure if you'd measure from the top right here yep to the jam i'll know how long to cut this column it's 34. And 7/16 you got it okay let's cut. Now getting a straight cut on a tapered column like this can be a bit tricky for me the best way to do it is to draw a line all the way around. And make the cut with my japanese handa all right wow beautiful the shortened column is attached to the base by applying glue gl. And then toenailing glue is also applied to the top of the column. And the two sections of the capital are set in place. And [applause] nailed [music] okay perfect let's give it a try all right well. So we give it it go hey you did it looks nice good job guys came out great let's see how we go yeah you have to get really on the flat oh look at that tell already a beautiful f man well you know when you see a paintbrush in hand on a project like this we're nearing the [music] end well i'm going to go you guys you can finish this up i think you got it well hand well you got us there ron i appreciate it oh you're very welcome don't stay too late. Now we won't okay we won't do it. And enjoy the room byebye thank you well sweetie between your design. And his  skillful implementation we've really added a lot of value here don't you think absolutely are you happy i i love it well. Now that's quite sweet who would have thought that separating a couple of rooms could bring a couple even closer together you know i'm not one to shatter misconceptions. But bigger is not necessarily always better a little while ago i widened this doorway from here out to here. And then put in these french doors i'm really happy with the way this turned out. But when i took this portion of the wall out well of course there was no flooring here. So i had to put new strips in. Now i'm faced with two problems these strips are slightly higher than the surrounding floor flor. And they're a different color well actually they're completely unfinished. So what i need to do is to level this down. And try to match the color. And finish you know what this is well if you said a paint scraper you'd be absolutely right. And are you're wondering why i'd want to use a paint scraper on this job well properly prepared this tool can do a great job of removing thin layers of wood. And properly prepared means getting it really sharp well this case i'm going to bring my sharpening station right to the work side here. So first thing take the paint scraper put it in our portable vise here. And tighten it up. Now this is a  a 10in maybe this is a 12in  mill file what i want to do is just pass this along the edge of the blade like this. Now if you look really closely here you see how shiny this is all the way across the blade that means i'm getting a really sharp edge from one side all the way over to the other well this feels pretty sharp let's give it a try here start here in the middle where there's a little bit of a ridge. Now if it's working right we should be kind of like peeling off some wood here see that's what i want to see there  that's much better by the way than  than dust that means that we're actually cutting the wood fibers this is working pretty well you can see kind of almost functioning like a plane however i'm going to switch to a different tool right up in here. Now this  scraper is much narrower. And it has a carbide tip right here which means it never has to be sharpened. And it's great for getting up into tight spots like [music] this. Now as i'm getting up close to the edge of the board here i've switched to a smaller scraper same idea same shaped blade just gives me a little more precise control well i've gone about as far as i can go with the scraper can to tell you this is a workout  what i want to do. Now is take a random orbital sander this is a fairly aggressive sander i want to smooth everything off. And i want to sand off  the finish that was on this one plank right here. But i'm going to be very careful only to sand right up to the edge of this plank well this is coming along just fine  next step for me is to take some wood filler. And fill up some nail holes right here. And then i've got a just a couple of places where there's a small gap. Now my technique for putting in wood filler is to put in enough to fill up the crack or the hole maybe slightly overfill it. But not much more because excess just means that stuff you got to sand off i use a vibrating palm sander with 100 grit paper for the final smoothing. Now it's time to remove any dust on the surface first with a vacuum. And then with a sticky tack cloth made just for this [music] purpose all right clean smooth. And dust free. Now it's time to put a finish on here the question is what color finish. Now i think these floors have just a clear coating on them. But i'm not 100% sure. So what i want to do is a little test here to kind of give me an idea what this would look like with a clear finish on it before i commit to that. And one way to do that is to put either water or alcohol on the wood. And wet it temporarily i'm going to use the alcohol because it'll evaporate very quickly. Now see if i just put a clear finish on that's what it's going to probably look like as you can see with just a clear finish the new wood would be a little lighter or less yellow than the adjacent planks. So i'm going to adjust the color by brushing on some shellac that has been thin with denatured alcohol at first the new wood appears too orange. So i wipe off a bit of the shellac while it's still wet well down to the final step right here going to put a clear polyurethane coating on this. And it might impart just a touch of color. But i don't expect very much i've poured some of it into this container this is a semi gloss finish which is i think what's on here not not high gloss let's go ahead. And brush the sun oh yeah well there we go. And you know what no one is ever going to know that those boards were new,https://youtu.be/9aUWQDn21Yo?t=192,"['What type of wood was used for the knee wall frame?', 'How do you score and break drywall to cut it?', 'Why use a paint scraper to level and finish wood?', 'What is the purpose of bedding coat of joint compound in taping?', 'What type of finish should be applied to the floors?']"

And natural gas prices are skyrocketing. And that means that homeowners are going to be facing higher winter heating bills than ever. But some are going to begin to investigate alternative heating sources. And one is the pellet stove got one right here from harmon. Now instead of burning split wood these stoves burn wood pellets this is actually compressed wood made mostly of waste sawdust. And chips you fill this hopper up. And that provides enough fuel for this stove to operate for about 24 hours it's completely automatic the only part that's not automatic is having to carry in the bags of fuel many dealers though will deliver them to start the stove you simply set the thermostat to the desired temperature tempure. And switch the power on the stove self ignites. And the fuel pellets are automatically fed into the fire chamber within minutes the stove is up. And running you can figure that a stove like this will cost about $600 to operate for the heating season. And it produces 50,000 btus that's enough heat to heat a house of 2200 square ft.

And more the key is to use the right blade or attachment for the job the oscillating saw was invented over 70 years ago originally as a device for safely removing plaster casts circular saws move in a rotary direction at high speed reciprocating saws move back. And forth in linear direction oscillating saws alternate direction up to 20,000 times per minute. But move through a very small arc about 3° in the case of cast removal this is what keeps it from cutting skin the secret to getting the most from an oscillating tool is in using a high quality blade. And matching the blade to the jw these blades all from zenith industry are manufactured from high performance alloys. And designed to cut specific materials each one goes through a microphase hardening process that improves performance. And keeps the tool sharper longer when it comes to cutting wood this chrome vadium fast cut blade is topof the line it features a japanese style tooth design with a double row of alternating bevel teeth it's the best choice for clean fat f cuts in wood the spacing of the teeth allows for sawdust. And small particles to be expelled greatly reducing any tendency to burn it's a good choice for plunge cuts in materials like laminate flooring. And for cutting door jams. And casings during tile wood or laminate flooring installations the blue oxide coating keeps this blade from leaving marks or stains on the material being cut. And protects the blade itself from rusting this fine too version of the chrome vadium blade also with the blue oxide coating is well suited for plunge cuts in drywall especially when doing cut-ins for electrical boxes this extra long blade has cobalt steel teeth. And a titanium nitride coating that makes it suitable for cutting bolts trimming off bent nails that are in awkward difficult to reach places. And cutting pipe when there's not enough space to use conventional plumbing tools its long reach also makes it a good choice for cutting through framing nails during demolition b metal blades also have cobalt teeth. And are a good choice for cutting through wood that has embedded nails this blade too can be used to separate nail together framing members semicircular blades made from high-speed steel offer excellent straight line cutting. And can even be used with a straight edge since the teeth have zero offset. And don't protrude from the sides of the blade this is also a good choice for terminating cuts without over cutting into adjacent surfaces for even more precise cutting the flat toothless portion of the blade can be used [music] carbide grit blades have no teeth. But instead have tough carbide grit vacuum brazed to their cutting edges these blades come in a variety of shapes.

And that is that they keep going up every month. And i can't help. But think that part of those heating. And cooling dollars are going right out my windows 30 5 years ago when this house was built these windows were standard fair in those days energy was cheap the fact that a single pain of glass was a poor insulator was well not that big a deal. Then heating. And cooling cost started climbing the storm windows that were put on about 20 years ago were supposed to make the house more energy efficient quite honestly i'm not sure how effective they really are. But more importantly i just don't like the way they look i also don't like what it takes to clean them [music]. So for all of those reasons i'm going to replace my old windows. And i'm going to replace them with this a state-of-the-art double hung window from pella. Now it's got the look that i want it's very energy efficient. And you won't believe how easy this is to clean the installation ah surprisingly simple step one is to remove the storm windows from the inside. Then start on the frame outside. Now this storm window frame is held in place with several screws around the outside i want to take it off. And normally what i do is just use a screwdriver. And back those screws out. But if you take a look here you see that i've got a problem these screw heads are covered with several coats of paint there's no way i'm going to get a screwdriver to engage that. So i'm going to use this little tool right here it's called a grabbit on one end is a reamer right here that'll bore kind of a small hole in the head of the screw. And on this end is the retractor. So let me load this up in the drill. And show you how it works first i use the reamer to create a cone-shaped depression. Then turn the bit end for end. And use the retractor to back out the screw [music] through back inside i use the utility knife to cut through the paint. And caul between this narrow strip of molding called a sash stop. And the window casing. Then i insert a putty knife. And work the sash stops loose enough to allow room for a pry bar i'm going carefully here because i want to reuse these when i install the new [music] window with the stops gone i remove the upper sash lower sash. And window track all at the same time this piece of wood called a parting strip comes out easily by gripping it with a pair of pliers. Now with the exception of the storm window i've been able to do all of my work from the inside there's been very little demolition required just the removal of these three strips of molding the outside trim. And the casing right here still intact with the window opening clean it's time for a test fit first i check the sill to make sure it's level. Then apply silicone sealant to the bottom [music] corners from my van i get a couple of rolls of aluminum weatherproofing tape i peel off the protective backing. Then starting on the sides press the tape onto the surface. And smooth it out with my hands the tape tape has a butal adhesive backing that will prevent any water from penetrating the [music] sill next i apply silicone sealant to the outside stop against which the new window frame will sit the edge of the window ledge or stoop as it's called. And the corners at the ends of the sill. Now i can set the window in place put putting the bottom in first. Then tipping the frame upright. And pushing it against the [music] stops i check to make sure the frame is square. Then begin installing shims first at the top. Then the bottom [music]. And finally the middle for the window to operate smoothly it's important that the gap between the sash. And frame be uniform top to bottom with the frame square. And locked in position i run screws into pre-drilled holes in the sides through the shims. And into the jam [music]. Then using a utility knife i score the shims. And break off the excess there's a small gap or space between the edge of the frame. And the window opening that i fill with low expansion foam made just for this purpose about the last thing i have left to do here on the inside is replace the sash stops i took off earlier [music] outside i begin making a watertight seal between the replacement window frame. And the original opening by pressing foam backer rod into the gap between the two. Then i fill the remaining space with silicone caul [music] spray the surface with a lubricant. And release liquid called mate. And tool the joint smooth with my finger this is a standard window screen. But i'm going to be putting in high transparency window screens pella calls them vivid view 50% more light three times as much air flow. And great curb appeal as a matter of fact it's like having no screen at all even though these windows are state-of-the-art they still look very conventional the mill work detailing classical hardware. And authentic proportions make them seem as if they've always been part of the house in fact they look even better than the original windows because i no longer have to use the storm windows. And the reason i don't have to use the storm windows is because of the way the new windows are constructed actually they're made up of two pieces of glass with a space in between filled with argon gas. Now here's how that works older windows typically have a single pane of glass that offers little insulation value in the winter warm air passes right through to the outside wasting energy in the summer outside heat penetrates the windows driving up air conditioning costs on the other hand double insulated glass with a gas filled barrier reflects warm air back into the house in the winter. And keeps heat outside during the summer lowering heating as well as air conditioning costs. Now these windows also have a coating on the glass it's called a low e coating that filters out damaging ultraviolet rays. And helps prevent fading out upholstery drapes. And carpeting. But you know what i think i like best about these windows is the way they've been designed for easy cleaning you lift up push the tabs on the inside tilt this down clean the outside of the window the upper sash works the same way when you finished put it back.

Now restoring or repairing that texture may seem challenging. But actually it's easier than you may think wall texture is intended to hide wall board joints. And other imperfections usually it's supplied with some sort of spray equipment during construction frequently the need to repair or restore wall texture occurs when a section of the wallboard itself has been replaced because of damage or repairs there are actually several different styles of wall texture. But two of the most popular are knockdown. And orange peel knockdown involves flattening the peaks left by a sprayon finish in orange peel resembles the skin texture of this popular citrus fruit hx bakes an aerosol product for creating both styles even though applying wall texture is a fairly straightforward process there are a number of variables that can come into play air pressure material volume distance from the nozzle to the wall. And spray pattern can all affect the final appearance for this reason the hx aerosol applicator head has two important adjustments this one for air pressure. And this one to control the volume of material the best way to map match an existing wall texture to experiment on a piece of scrap cardboard. Then hold the sample up next to the wall orange peel texture is simply sprayed on the wall. And left to dry knockdown requires a second step using either a joint knife or this knockdown tool that features a sponge rubber pad attached to the blade i found this tool easier to use. And less likely to leave edge marks hold the knockdown tool almost parallel to the surface before spraying hold the aerosol can upside down. And shake vigorously to thoroughly mix the contents i found that holding the can 12 to 16 in from the wall gave me the best results the material can be applied in a circular or linear pattern. But what's important is to keep the can in motion at all times when you're finished hold the can up side down. And pull the trigger to clear the nozzle after a short wait usually a minute or less the knockdown tool is passed over the surface using light pressure if for any reason you're not pleased with the look it's very simple to remove the texture. And start over once the texture dries it can be [applause] painted.

And machines to build to fix to improve we're known as do-it-yourselfers home improvement fans fix it fanatics inventors at our core though we're all makers. So let's jump in. And make something hi i'm ron hazelton welcome to the show today's house call takes me to the home of two radio personalities who want to add charm in a romantic setting to their bedroom with a ventless gas fireplace. Then i turn up the temperature right here in my own shop by installing a heater made just for the purpose stick with me you'll be glad you [music] did 95 northbound state police on the scene i'm an ronda pierre we be want to wait first fast accurate traffic good morning storm. And norman it's the weeb wake up morning show sunny. And very cold today we have high about 25. And it is 8 right. Now at web18 we make an appeal this morning to ron hazelton. Now ron if you're listening my wife. And i would like to see whether or not you can put in one of those beautiful ventless fireplaces in our bedroom toh take the chill off these  winter nights. Now how often do i get a house call request over the air. And from storm. And norman at that i got to check this out [music] hey guys how are you oh snow snow. And more snow in the way here yeah yeah that's a good thing i heard you had a good sense of humor. So i just couldn't pass that up well ron this is it our bedroom this is it the passion palace yes kind of i can see it right. Now you want to lie bed cold winter's evening fireplace sounds good that myself. So this is where you're thinking about putting it we were hoping if we could get a corner unit that this would be a nice spot to enjoy it from the bed or from our seating area. Now i'm trying to think  whether we should go vent or ventless i'm leaning toward the the ventless  the technology has been around for decades in europe it's been well established here it's safe even for a bedroom. And then we avoid all that work as you say putting holes in the ceiling in the wall. So why don't we get online kind of just you know look around a little bit. And see what's out there. And and what appeals to you this is the empire comfort systems website it's their white mountain hearth collection this is a ventfree fireplace right here could it be painted oh sure i think it comes in  it comes in white hey guys take a look at this will this is not an example of my cabinet making ability. But it will serve to give you some idea of what that unit you guys liked online yeah might look like in here from proportion standpoint right yeah this is great i'm starting to be able to imagine it can you see it yeah fire flames okay i can feel it. Now what i want you to do. And i'm serious about this. But go over there. And lie in bed for a second will you i want you to see how it looks to you from that perspective it's nice yeah is there any way we could maybe raise it up a little higher on on a hearth or something. So we could actually see the fire part yeah why don't we try that yeah let's pick up grab an edge. And then we can slide this under i got it something we can just take it up a little bit john gam okay oh he'd be proud to be part of this project what do you think i like that.

And i head back to start the insation my hearth kit has a top. And three sides our first step is to attach some glue blocks along the edge this is like how i do on my hot [music] dogs bring this right up we going to nail right into that block we just put on okay we'll pull this side up. Now all right all right one more huh side number three what i did is i cut a couple of kind of corner braces to drop in here. So take your nail gun. Now and right down through here give me about four your fingers oh i let do that once little carpenter humor okay i say let's give this a test fit huh all right let spin it around all set okay let's keep our fingers cross okay looks pretty good we just got one little problem the baseboard is keeping the hearth from sitting tightly against the wall. So we turn the base bottom side up clamp on a piece of scrap trim as a template trace the outline. And cut out the shape with a jigsaw wow. So this is what i would call a ledge it's a piece of wood that we're going to attach to the wall to support the back of this i'm right the top of the board right on that line you got [music] it it should drop right in well our ledger's installed. And we've got a snug fit all around. So we nail everything in place well norman here it is everything we need for your fireplace. And manle right here all the good stuff the good stuff. And you're going to be amazed how easily this goes together we set the fireplace base on our raised hearth place the firebox on top about halfway. And attach it in place with [music] screws next i attach the flexible gas line. And tighten the connection. Then we remove the protective plastic from the metal trim set the fireplace surrounds in position. And then the a [music] sprint once again we attach ledgers to the wall. Then slide the fireplace assembly into position finally we set the mtle on top. And attach it to the ledgers all right huh solid yeah looks pretty good looks very official looking. And back  honey i don't think. So out here you know where she is no i think she went shopping get some access think we should go forward without her taking a look at this no really no think she'll be long no she should be back pretty soon. So thanks you know this is coming out really good how's everybody the family yeah good the little one yeah i'm getting like that 2 hours of sleep every night oh you're going to love that i'll see your red anchor. And i'll raise you an orange screw. And a molly bolt oh honey honey honey h you guys have been  hard at work i see we you know we we we didn't really want to go ahead until you took a look at it what do you think wow huh okay wait let me block this out for a moment wow i think i really like it well this is the main reason i wanted to get your input here is  what we're going to do up here  we can leave it just like this. But my thought is if we were to put some kind of a a wall back here right we might make this look more like there's actually a chimney there. And that would come up flat yeah come up here. And i think it might sell the idea that this is a built-in more of a built-in fireplace. And it would give me a nice spot to maybe hang a picture right yeah okay yeah. Now i didn't get that right away. But while i was sleeping it came to me in a dream that that paid off. So and this is what i'm thinking of here. But just stand back. And kind of look at that. And see if you think you're going to like that better than just the wall i i'll put it up i'll take it down you know ron i think i like a lot better this time we put our ledger strips up vertically nailing them into the wall studs. Then we position a piece of/ in plywood on top of the ledgers. And nail it in place finally we install t drywall over the plywood. And secure it with screws next i apply a bedding coat of joint compound to the seams tear off lengths of joint tape dampen them in water apply the tape to the seams press it firmly into the compound using a putty knife. And finally snip off the excess. Now it's time to trim out our base with decorative edge molding. And install baseboard a couple of coats of paint. And form begins setting the logs in place this is about the only wood carrying he'll have to do for this [music] fireplace wow not only can we build good fireplaces we're good interior decorators too look at that way terrific hey how are you i've got one more edition i think it looks fantastic. But i got to see this oh yeah you wanted that wall. So you could hang a picture on yes i did here it is voila nice huh it looks great ron this calls for a toast let me go get the champagne hey nice fireplace certainly is  nice to be here lying this was a great idea looking ready ready he may i pour to the fireplace okay thank you thank you yes.

And already it's become apparent i've got to have some heat out here. Now i don't need to keep this at a constant temperature that is a living temperature. But i do want to be able to get the heat up quickly when i need it. So i settled on this unit right here it's called the hot dog. Now this heater comes in four different sizes 30,000 btus 45,000 btus 60,000. And 70,000 btus this is the 60,000 btu model right here. And this is the one that's the right size for my shop. So let's get started we're going to put this [music] up there we go. Now this heater is designed to attach directly to the bottom of the joist. But in this case i want to mount it in an angle. So i've added a couple of 2x sixes up here. And leg screwed those into the joist. Now since i'm going to be working alone today one of the more challenging parts of this project may be hoisting this 80 lb heater up there where i'm going to attach it to those 2x sixes to start with i've wrapped a couple of cargo straps around the case a little research leads me to a marine supply store where i check out things in the rigging department. Now to do the heavy lifting today i've decided to use this marine block. And tackle it's designed to lift very heavy booms on sailing ships lightweight very strong a little pricey. But it's a lifetime tool. Now i'm going to attach it to this 2x4 that i put up earlier the lower end of the block. And tackle gets attached to the cargo straps. Then i hoist the 80 lb heater upward as easily as a sailor would raise a maino on a mizon mast once in position i clamp the mounting flanges. And more clearance holes next i insert carriage bolts. And finally twist on nuts. And snug them tight with a socket wrench. Now this being a gas burning appliance of course i've got to exhaust those gases out of flu. So the first thing i'm going to do is attach this t-shaped piece of flu to the back of the furnace right here. And i'll attach that permanently a little bit later on. Now there's going to be a second piece of pipe that'll go from the center of this flu right up through the roof that means we're going to have to cut a hole up there that's exact ly on top of this one right here. So let's take a plum bop this is the best way to do this i'm going to move it around up here until the plumb bob is centered directly over this flu all right. Now i'll make a mark right up here at the top of the plum bob line right there next i bore through the roof. And insert a wire coat hanger well the coat hanger marks the spot we won't need that anymore. So let me push this back down through through here. Now what i want to do is draw a circle 6 in in diameter. Now this is a lumber crayon that i have in here i bore a halfin hole on the edge of the circle insert the blade of a jigsaw. And make the cutout well this is the flashing that's going to make the watertight seal eventually around our fl i'm going to set this about where i want it here. And that is i want to center the large opening down here on the bottom over that hole that we cut in the roof that looks pretty good. Now i'm going to reach inside with my lumber crayon be careful because this is sharp here i'm going to trace the outline of this sort of oval shaped base here. Then using a utility knife with a hooked blade i cut along the mark that i just made next i apply sealant to the lower shingles where the base will be sitting on top. Then i slide the flashing underneath the upper shingles. And into the circular cutout finally i secure the flashing base with roofing nails this is double walled vent pipe the inner liner is aluminum the outside is galvanized steel. Now the idea is that even though there are hot gases passing through this pipe the outer jacket remains cool what i'm going to do is pass this up through that flashing we put on earlier the lower end of the pipe i connect to the vent coming out of the back of the heater the joints are held together with couplings that snap into place back up on the roof i slip a weather ring over the top of the vent. And slide it down to the top of the flashing finally i set the vent cap in place. And apply sealant to the nail heads with everything finished on the roof i go back inside to make the electrical connections next i apply thread sealant to the gas pipe sections tighten them together. And finally connect the flexible gas line i installed the main part of the gas line. And shut off valve earlier [music] i've installed a programmable thermostat because out here in the garage workshop i don't need heat all the time just when i'm working. And the nice thing about this one is if i'm coming to work at 9:00 i can set this to bring the heat up around 8:30 i can't tell you how glad i am that i put this unit in in the few weeks since i've installed it the temperature hasn't gotten above freezing. And this heater is done a great job of giving me heat where i want it when i want [music]",https://youtu.be/9ZWU4IbeD1M?t=650,"['What type of heating unit was chosen for the shop?', 'How many different sizes are available for the hot dog heater?', 'Why did the author choose to mount the heater at an angle?', 'What tool was used to lift the 80 lb heater into position?', 'What is the purpose of the flashing base in the vent pipe installation?']"

Now these are sometimes called instant glues they're very easy to use in this case i'm just going to put some glue on this edge here i'm not going to make any effort to smooth this out actually what i kind of want is a sort of a little bead going here. But i do want it to be continuous because this is going to have to hold liquids all right. Now that's on i'm going to press these two pieces together just hold them just like this. Now the thing about cyano accolades is they come in different thicknesses generally speaking the more coarse or porous the material the thicker glue you'll want to use you also want to use the thicker glues on plastics. Now this particular one that i'm using takes about 10 to 15 seconds to set up. So i should be able to let go of this. And have a repair. Now the truth is i want to wait about 24 hours for this to reach maximum hardness.

And machines to build to fix to improve we're known as do-it-yourselfers home improvement fans fix it fanatics. And vendors at our core though we're all makers. So let's jump in. And make something hi i'm ron hazelton welcome to the show well i'm trying my best to join the green thumb club doing what i can to learn the ins. And outs of gardening what i've discovered though is keeping my plants properly watered well it can be a real challenge. So i've decided to install an automatic drip irrigation system you'll see how simple it can be. Then i head to the sunshine state to help turn a bare al cove into a built-in entertainment center stay with me you'll be glad you [music] did you know the longer i'm here the more i enjoy my gardening. But i've got one problem when it comes to watering i'm on the road a lot. And sometimes several days can go by. And these guys don't get any water also i've got several different situations container plants back here foundation plants over here. And flowering plants. So what i'm going to do is install an automatic drip irrigation system it'll water the plants even if i'm not at home. And take into account their individual requirements as much as 2third of the water used in our homes is actually used outside taking care of our yard. And plants. And drip irrigation can show as much as a 70% water savings over other methods also studies have shown that plant material grows as much as 50% faster using drip irrigation my drip irrigation system is going to start right here with this hose bib or faucet. Now the first thing i want to do is screw on this check valve it's designed to keep the irrigation water out here from flowing inside the house. And contaminating my household water supply tightening this set screw will keep vibration or maybe even the kids from loosening the valve the next thing i want to do is turn this single faucet right here into four using what's called a hose bib manifold. Now these are pressure reducers in a lot of homes water pressure can run 60 80 some places even over 100 lb per square inch that's way too much pressure for a drip irrigation system. So what this device does is drop it down from household pressure to something in the 20 to 25 lb range in the area that i've decided to irrigate there are several different kinds of plants with different water requirements. So i've set up three areas or zones. And each one of them is going to be served by by one of these outlets this fourth one over here will be for my garden hose. Now remember in my case i want the water to come on. And turn off automatically. So the next step for me is to install or in this case just screw on an automatic valve these electronic valves operate using very low voltage they'll turn the water on. And off for each zone when they're instructed to do. So now this is the brain behind my automatic drip irrigation system it's called a timer or controller it's completely weatherproof battery operated. And each of these automatic valves will plug into the bottom like this. And then the controller itself mounts on the front of one of the valves. Now i'm going to program this. And it will tell each of these automatic valves which day of the week to turn on which time of the day to come on. And how long to run well i'm finished with the work on my water source. Now i need to set up a distribution system to get the water from the valves to where it's needed that water highway if you will is/ in polyethylene [music],https://youtu.be/7DFcWUU_cks?t=0,"['What type of devices are used to control and regulate the flow of water in an automatic drip irrigation system?', 'How does a pressure reducer work in relation to household water pressure?', 'What is the primary advantage of using drip irrigation compared to other methods of watering plants?', 'How do electronic valves operate in an automatic drip irrigation system?', 'What type of materials are used for the distribution system in an automatic drip irrigation setup?']"

And make it more pliable. And two invest in a pair of these cutters one end of the tubing i connect to the automatic valves in my case since i have fairly deep mulch in my beds i'm going to lay the tubing on top of the ground. So all i'll have to do is rake a path. Then use tubing stakes to anchor the run in [music] place. Now when you reach the end of a run of tubing like this you have to close or cap it off there are a couple of ways to do that one is to take a figure8 clip like this slip it over the tubing bend the tubing. And then slide the clip back up to keep it in position sort of like you'd bend a garden hose to stop the flow of water another way to end a run of tubing is with a cap like this when winter weather comes i can just unscrew the cover. And drain the lines this 1/2 in polyethylene tubing brings water into a general area. And this smaller quin tubing delivers it to individual plants or groups of plants to attach the smaller tubing to the large i first use a special punch to make a small hole. Then snap in a connector next i slip on a piece of/ quin tubing. And cut it to length on the ends of the tubing go the emitters small nozzles if you will that emit different amounts of water anywhere from one to 4 gall per hour in a variety of patterns drip emitters like this are extremely efficient delivering water directly to the base of the plant misters sprays. And sprinklers are often mounted on higher stakes. And distribute water in quarter circle half circle full circle even rectangular patterns just one of these can water several plants at once for my container plants here i'm going to use something called soaker tubing the water actually penetrates through the wall. Now it's very easy to use i start by putting a t in the end of the quarter-inch tubing like this place one end of the soaker tubing on one arm of the te lay the soaker tube around the base of the plant cut it to length. And then hook the end of the tube on the other of the [music] tea. Now for my hanging plants i'm going to use this flexible [music] mister with this part of my irrigation system in place. And ready to go to work i can rake the mulch back over the tubing making it invisible yet accessible the tubing can also be buried usually a trench just a few inches deep is add since the line is not under pressure freezing is usually not a concern the simplest way to run tubing across grass is to make an angled cut through the turf using a flat garden spade. Then lever the side upward to create a shallow groove set the tubing in the bottom of the cut. And press the grass back into place this is called a sidewalk tunneling tool it's simply a plastic nozzle attached to a length of pvc pipe with a hose connected to the opposite end the stream of water actually bs a hole under the sidewalk once i'm through i use a pair of pvc pipe cutters to snip off the nozzle. And the hose connector the plastic pipe stays in place. And acts as a conduit i just push the irrigation tubing through it well i'm up early this morning. But not as early as my automatic irrigation system you know it's good to know that even if i'm on the road or i want to sleep in late these guys are not going to suffer because of [music],https://youtu.be/7DFcWUU_cks?t=254,"['What is polyethylene tubing used for?', 'How do you warm up polyethylene tubing before use?', 'What is a figure8 clip used for in irrigation?', 'How does soaker tubing work with plants?', 'What is the purpose of PVC pipe cutters in irrigation systems?']"

And u as you can see right. Now it looks fairly  undone unfinished. So i really wanted a nice entertainment center. So everything could have a proper place for it okay rita's living room has an al cove that's the perfect place for the kind of entertainment center she has in mind she wants something that looks built in. And can house her tv stereo cds books. And of course little little ornaments that's not what tvs look like these days is it. Now it's time to sit down. And draw a rough sketch the base section will have doors. And drawers for lots of out of side storage on top we'll build three cabinets with adjustable shelving finally to give our project that built-in look what we want to do is is put this in place. And then trim out the way i see it the edge of it right here all the way around with molding that would look great. So that it looks like it was it's built into the unit to save time. And money. And a lot of work we construct the base from stock kitchen cabinets purchased at the nearby home improvement center the cabinets are first clamped together. Then secured with screws on each end we attach a filler strip to conceal the space between the cabinets in the wall. Now it's the same with the drill the further you pull the trigger the faster the blade goes before setting the base section in place we cut holes in the back of the cabinets to give us access to the electrical outlets. And tv cable jack in the wall boring holes through the sides of the cabinets will allow us to run wires wherever we need them next we measure for the countertop. So all the way to the corner okay 79. And 3/4 okay good. And now let's measure from the wall 29 and2 okay transfer those measurements to a sheet of 3/4 inch plywood okay want our cut here to be at 21. Then it's time for rita to confront the tool she's most uncomfortable using okay have you ever used one of these before no are you concerned about using this. So a little bit are you yeah keep going there you go all right there you go beautiful straight cut good how was that not. So bad not. So scary rita's first cutting job results in a near perfect fit way back a piece of 1x8 popler notched to fit around the corners conceals the edge of the plywood push it all the way down. And then just pull the trigger like that good grav. Then it's time for a shot with a nail gun. Now if we were building a wet bar or a built-in sideboard you know we could stop right here or we'd have to put on a better countertop maybe plastic lamet or even granite. But the point is this is a great way to get a built-in run of base cabinets like this using offthe shelf kitchen cabinets you can see that these went together in a very short time. And they cost us less than $300. But we're not stopping here we're building an entertainment center it's going to go all the way up. So now let's move on to the next section the upper portion of our entertainment center will be made in three sections a center section for the tv. And two side sections for books audio gear. And collectibles using the circular saw. And a clamp on straight edge as a guide we cut the sides bottoms. And tops from sheets of 3/4 in birch veneer plywood. Now the upper section of our entertainment center is going to have adjustable shelves they're going to be supported on pins just like these. And these pins are going to be set into a series of holes. Now two things are really important here these holes have to start at the same point usually near the bottom. And they have to be spaced precisely the same distance apart. Now here's how we've been drilling those holes. So accurately after measuring. And drawing a baseline i align. And clamp a pre-drilled plastic template to the cabinet side using a self centering drill bit i. Then drill a series of holes about 2/3 of the way through the wood the process is. Then repeated on all of the cabinet sides the face of this cabinet grade plywood is smooth. And clean. But like most plywood the edges are rough. And unfinished to conceal them i apply edge banding a thin strip of wood with a heat activated adhesive backing once it's trimmed. And sanded it'll make these plywood panels look like solid wood we're going to face the edges of our shelves with a solid piece of 1x two lumber this edging will make the shelves more rigid. And will give them a thicker more substantial appearance well it's time for some of assembly. And we're going to start with this n section right here i've laid all the pieces out on the table. Now we're going to glue. And nail these together. But to help us position these pieces for assembly. And to make the unit stronger we're going to be using these wooden biscuits or splines the biscuits are set into slots cut with this machine called a plate joiner which can be rented or purchased for as little as $100 once the jointer has cut the slot glue is applied. And a biscuit or a spline is inserted with the bis gets in place more glue is applied to the surface of the wood. And the pieces are pressed together just put put them right in the slots with the splines holding everything in the correct position the two pieces are nailed a lot of things that we've done. So far it's just a matter of watching on how it's done. And then i can become a pro because that's all you need basically is you need to be shown how to do something. And then once you have that information that knowledge. Then you can do it yourself go we complete this same assembly process for all three upper cabinets. And carry each one back into the house very nice job slide into [music] place okay very [music] slowly great job good job after securing the cabinets together with screws we cut trim strips. And attach them to the front edge of the cabinets to conceal the joint. Now rita gets a chance to try out the power miter saw as she cuts the molding or casing that will give the entire unit that built-in look finally it's time to mount the cabinet doors install the drawers. And set the shelves into position okay beautiful boy let time me take a look at this this came out. So nice i know we did it. But i i must say it really turned out nicely you know what was the most satisfying thing for you on this project i think seeing it all put together at the end it's it's a little hard to imagine sometimes just seeing the different parts. And pieces. But when it's all pulled together you really you really see what it is. And i got to tell you this really changes the personality of the entire room remember back what it looked like with that just hole here horrible. And now what it looks like. And it changed your personality too it did yes you have a tool personality.

And material you'll surely want to know about developed by master tile setter arman tavi it's designed to give you professional quality job that will look great. And last for decades creating attractive tiled floors. And walls like this over concrete. And wallboard is quick. And easy using the taby thin skin method to begin apply the adhesive or glue directly to the floor using a not [music] tr in this example we're going to coat the wall with the same adhesive while the glue is still wet lay this fiberglass reinforced paper on top of the adhesive the joints can be overlapped or buted the paper bonds securely to the glue. And the glue adheres to the concrete underneath paper is also applied to the wall ensuring that regardless of the condition of the wallboard the tile that will eventually go on top will be securely. And permanently bonded for the wall tiles we're using a premixed mastic applied with a notch tr check the instructions on the mastic container for the correct tri notch size this 2in square tile comes in 12x2 mats that are simply pressed into the mastic notice that arman tavi creator of the thin skin system starts at the bottom. And works upward to prevent the tile sheets from sliding down when they're placed on the wall specially designed spacers created by armen are inserted into the joints between the sheets ensuring that the grout lines are straight even. And uniform their open design keeps the tile corners visible for perfect alignment the floor tiles are going to be installed using thin set mortar the powder is emptied into a bucket. And first mixed to blend the dry ingredients. Then armen slowly adds water until the mixture is smooth lump free. And about the consistency of sour cream the mortar is applied to the reinforced paper as a thin skim coat that conditions the paper for a heavier application that will follow after the skim coat dries a second coat of mortar is applied using a notch trowel the trowel is held at a consistent angle. And the notches leave ridges of mortar that are uniform in height ensuring that each tile is fully supported by the mortar underneath the tiles in this case 6in squares are pressed into the mortar bed. Now notice how armen slides the tiles from side to side flattening the mortar ridges underneath. And distributing the cement evenly across the back of the time p a few taps from a mallet further ensures a good bond since they float arman often keeps his tile spacers in a bucket of water here as on the wall the spacers ensure joints that are consistent. And straight by cutting a spacer in half it can be used around the edge where the floor meets the wall with all the full tiles in place cas it's time to cut those that will fit around the toilet flange first armen traces. Then cuts out a paper template. Then he applies a couple of tape strips to a piece of tile. And draws the shape onto the tape using a tile saw he makes one large cut. Then several smaller ones up to the line [music] finally for finishing. And smoothing he uses the blade as a [music] grinder sometimes the thin set mortar can squeeze up between tiles leaving no room for the grout that will soon be applied the dried mortar can be removed with a utility knife or grout saw vacuum any dust off the face of the tile. And and out of the grout joint after the thins set has dried for at least 24 hours it's time for grout the dry ingredients are mixed together to evenly distribute the color pigments. Then the powder is added to a small amount of water. And [music] stirred more water is added to the mixture until it's smooth. And thoroughly blended to the consistency of pudding [music] a sponge rubber float is used to apply grout arman first forces the material all the way to the bottom of the joint completely filling it. Then he tilts the float up on edge. And moving diagonally from corner to corner removes any excess material from the face if the float is not kept on the diagonal it can scoop out grout previously put into the joint virtually the same technique is used on the smaller tiles the grout is. Then left to dry about 45 minutes to an hour until the material is firm in the joints. And a dry haze is visible on the face of the tile at this point it's time to clean off the remaining grout using a grout sponge dipped in water we're going to take about 80% of it out. And leave some behind we're going to take the sponge. And just coat it over the tiles the tile will usually need to be washed two or three times turn the sponge over when one side becomes dirty. And rinse it frequently for the final wash armen begins with fresh water as he wipes the tile he tips the sponge up. So that just the edge is in contact. And makes long strokes lifting the sponge at the end. And then presenting a clean edge for the next stroke the tile saw can be used to create a customiz sponge ideal for getting into corners like this one where the floor meets the wall once the tiles are thoroughly dry any remaining haze is removed with a soft [music] cloth. So if you're planning on tiling over concrete. Now you know what to use.

Now you know what to use. And how to do [music] it well i'm headed down to cape coral florida. Now steven hs have a very nice house down there they want to put some ceiling panels in their family room i'm going to see if i can help out their roomy spanish style home is typical of those built here in recent years. But their idea for dressing it up isn't they've invited me to cape coral to help them give their den ceiling a dramatic new look we had been to a restaurant in fort meyers that had a ceiling done in peky cyprus. And as a matter of fact i'm sure they thought we were rather strange because of instead of sitting there eating he was standing up taking pictures of the ceiling with his come over to say what the heck are you doing i was waiting for them to do that. So this is the restaurant here. Now wood ceiling panels are usually made from pine. But the herses fell in love with this once abundant. But now rare native florida wood called pecky cyprus. And special ordered it from their home improvement center pecky refers to the pock marks or elongated holes that give this wood its unique unque character. But apparently when the bark gets damaged or a branch breaks off a fungus actually invades the tree. And then works its way up in in the little rings here where the where the where the moisture would go after removing all the furniture steve. And barb use electronic stud finders to locate all the ceiling joists they identify the location of each joist by snapping chalk lines our paneling planks will run perpendicular to the joist. And will be nailed into them. But first the planks need to be cut to fit inside the beams. So steve takes a measurement the same this looks like 61. And a/4 here okay. Now it's likely there could be as much as a quarter inch difference between the beams from one end of each section to the other. So measurements are made about every 12 in 2 by 61. And 38 m,https://youtu.be/gCRmW_NDM7A?t=497,"['What type of wood is typically used for ceiling panels?', 'Why did Steve and Barb choose pecky cyprus instead of pine?', 'How do you locate the ceiling joists when installing ceiling panels?', 'What happens to the tree when a fungus invades it and causes pock marks?', 'How are the paneling planks cut to fit inside the beams?']"

So measurements are made about every 12 in 2 by 61. And 38 m hey guys hi all finished oh yes have all the measurements all the measurements all the studs are marked we're ready to cut. So what what do we want to cut first what length well i guess we came up the the first section is off just a here. So probably about half of them go in at 61. And 1 e. And the rest of them at 61. And 1/4 in okay. So here's the way this thing works over here okay is we just loosen this up. And we're going to do the 61. And 1 e first. So we set the edge of this right there at 61. And 1 e that way we don't have to measure each board i pre-cut the end here. So we got a nice square end to start with. So who wants to cut first i think it should be bar should be me okay okay bring it out like this bring it all the way down till it stops. And then push it all the way in till it stops let it come up. And then release the trigger okay ch steve our measurement is one inch off oh really we're at 60. And an e versus 61. And an e m did that oh it must have this this is why my things never fit i just realized. Now only it's only an inch thank you very much for catching that. Now this is very embarrassing i hope that we cut this out of the show well with the expert set straight by his student barb cuts the first of several planks at 61 i know i know 61. And an eight there you go wonderful how was thatuh that was great steve cuts the next batch of board slightly longer since the distance between the beams is wider at one end. Now we got one little problem here there's a corner that's sort of cut off right here because of this fan light box. So we're going to have to cut an angle on the end of this first board first of all i want to measure from this corner down to see where that angle starts that's about 55. And a2 we'll mark that on the board. And then i want to see what the actual angle is this is called a bevel gauge i'm going to put it right in here one side on that wall one side over here. And that's the angle that we need to accomplish. So this is the angle that we took off the ceiling is lay this bevel gauge right here on the saw. And we're going to rotate the saw table right here until the edge lines up with that bevel gauge. Then we'll take the board. So we'll slide that down. Now you want to put the left edge of the blade on that little mark right there okay barb hand that board up here let's see what kind of an angle cutter you are okay all right drop it in here i'd say that just about perfection look at that great great okay guys i think we can start to glue these up well we've cut enough paneling for this first section up here. Now this is called tongue. And groove paning why because each piece has a tongue. And a groove a tongue on one side a groove on the other side when we put this up we're going to slip that tongue into the groove. And this gives us quite a bit of strength actually makes us almost as strong as a solid panel all right we're going to attach this up mostly with construction or panel adhesive. And i'm going to put some on right. Now we're going to kind of apply this in sort of a serpentine pattern like this not too much i don't want to make this too thick okay guys first board coming up all right. So this is the one with the angle cut on the end put it right up there in the corner like we did before push it in. And then push it up to the ceiling. Now pull it down from the ceiling pull it down again. And then put it back up that'll make sure that the adhesive gets distributed right. Now you've got the pneumatic nail gun you've got your ceiling joist mark put a couple nails right into the joist there we're off. And running guys here comes your next board okay remember the groove. Now is going to engage the tongue. And then push it up. And then pull it down just a little bit. And then put it up again okay okay waiting glue man huh [music] right when we reach the wall we're left with a gap narrower than our planks. So we measure it transfer that distance to a plank. And rip it to size on the table saw. Now steve here's the strip that you cut off before we put it up we're going to have to make a little modification to it it. And i've made up a little demo here to show you why  we want this to drop in  next to that last full board. But you see the one side of the groove there is going to be getting in the way. So what we're going to have to do is cut that one half of the groove off. So that this just drops in like that. Then we'll glue. And nail it in place i've lowered the blade on the table saw. And steve pushes the plank through taking off only the bottom lip of the groove. Now it's simple to slip the arrow board into the gap. Then we glue. And nail it into place once it's up we move on to the next ceiling [music] section well the boards go up nice. And easy until we reach this speaker hole which we must cut around barb. And steve hold the first panel that overlaps the hole in place steve traces the arc onto the back. And then cuts it out with a jigsaw looks good okay great steve applies the adhesive. And barb nails the board into place since the second panel would completely cover the hole we first cut it into two pieces leaving the end of the first piece slightly overlapping the hole this time we trace the arc of the circle on the end of the plank. Then barb takes a turn in the jigsaw to cut it to shape we repeat the process on the other side of the hole finally barb. And steve trac. And cut the third board exactly as they did the first we'll try. And fit the speaker support rig oh look at that just like downtown could be better with the speaker hole out of the way we take a little break from the ceiling panels. And move outside to paint some wood molding which we'll use to frame each ceiling section all right. Now i may have cut this a little bit long because i rather be long than short let's see oh well oh my gosh seems to be just about perfect boy. Now that is sheer luck it never happens to looks pretty good except when i'm working with you steve you're a good omen we work our way around each section measuring cutting. And attaching the rest of the molding. Now for a final touch steve. And barb have elected to faux finish the beans after a long day we can finally relax room's back together. And the ceiling looks absolutely beautiful i love the pecky part i do too i can't believe the difference i think the the beauty to me is i love the wood. But with focus on the ceiling it kind of brings the room down a little bit makes it a little more cozy. And for me the speaker  when we got to the speaker wondering how you were going to get that hole cut some really good tips it did take quite a bit of challenging thought on my part well the real credit for today's project goes to barb.

Now what i like about portable generators is their flexibility you can run power anywhere you can run an extension cord. So i can use them to operate a light or a microwave what i can't do though is provide emergency power to a built-in refrigerator or an exhaust fan using an extension cord. Now that generator that i have outside produces 3,000 watts of power that's enough to light 30 100 watt light bulbs. Now that sounds like a lot. But if i were to operate the microwave a toaster. And say a hair drive i would have used up almost all of my power. So i'm going to install an automatic standby generator what it's going to do is to provide me backup power 24 hours a day 7 days a week as a matter of fact it could cover me in a power blackout even if i wasn't home my backup power system is a new super quiet model from guardian called quiet source installation is being done by canondale generators a local company that's put in some 2500 home generators around here step one is to remove about 15 square ft of sod. And compact the soil next stone dust is dumped on top rak out. Then tamped to provide a firm level [music] surface this 11,000 watt unit weighs over 500 lbs. And comes mounted on its own base the trick is to slip it off the pallet. And on into a couple of rollers which are. Then removed the key to making a generator like this automatic is a power transfer switch which electrician tony dne. And his crew are installing in my basement my electrical lines from the street will be connected to one side of the transfer switch when power is lost the transfer switch sends a signal to the generator to start once up to speed the generator begins sending power back to the transfer switch it relays power to 12 circuits over here in my main circuit breaker panel. Now these are circuits that i pre-selected like kitchen. And basement lighting the boiler the master bedroom lighting the basement freezer. And the kitchen refrigerator things that i know i'll need in a power outage. And things that'll make life more comfortable the gas line is run. And pressure tested. Then plumber jim moriset makes the final connections this generator uses natural gas which means i won't have to worry about fuel storage it can also operate on propane well our generator's in. And running. And quite quietly i might add as a matter of fact it sounds about like a central air conditioning compressor. Now it's putting out 11,000 watts right. Now that's about 95 amps plenty of juice to run anything we'd want to operate during a power outage to put our new backup power system to the test we decide to conduct a simulated power outage our friend josephine shuts off the main breaker in the basement. And we do what we normally do light the candles within seconds the generator starts automatically when the power is restored the generator will shut off automatically. And we'll hardly have missed a beat that was only like about 10 or 15 seconds heack up a lot better than the  the [music]",https://youtu.be/9Dui8Z8owjY?t=113,"['What type of power can be provided by an automatic standby generator?', 'How many watts does the installed generator produce?', 'Why is it difficult to provide emergency power to certain appliances using an extension cord?', 'Who installs the backup power system and what company are they from?', 'How long did the simulated power outage test take before the generator shut off automatically?']"

So what do you get for the difference in cost the larger. And more powerful disposers get the quieter they run why because they have quieter motors. And more sound dampening insulation higher end models also have stainless steel grinders. And stainless steel grind chambers finally when you get to the upper end of the pricing spectrum you can find disposers that have an auto reversing feature to help prevent jamming. Now now there are two basic types of garbage disposers the continuous feed type that operates from a wall switch. And the batch type that turns on when you put the top in. And turns off when you remove it. Now if you have a septic tank like i do you might be concerned about even using a disposer well this could be the answer this unit injects a small amount of enzyme each time it's operated.

But walking on it well that can be a dangerous matter. And i'm going to do something about it. Now like most of my projects this one begins with a shopping trip to pick up a slip resistant rug pad [music] you know a lot of really good-looking rugs don't have a slip resistant back. And in my book well that's just an accident waiting to happen. So here's an easy way to turn a slippery rug into a slipfree rug i've turned the rug over. And i'm placing the rubber pad on the back i'm going to mark this just. So that it's about one inch smaller than the rug itself. Now i'll cut this out with a pair of scissors okay i'll check this for fit should be about a 1 inch margin around the edge more or less good. Now i used to just put this down on the floor the pad. And then the carpet on top. But what i found is that the rug actually slips on top of the pad sometimes. So when i started doing was sticking the pad to the rug using this double stick carpet tape again you can find this in your home improvement center in most hardware stores or carpet stores. Now once i've got the perimeter done i like to put a couple of strips in the middle some people call this the [music] field. Now i'm going to peel off the protective backing here [music] i'm going to put the pad on. Now just kind of very lightly till i get position where i want it with that one inch margin okay let's try it out.

And there we have it that's how i turn a slippery rug into a slip free rug [music] lori. And david oriel of naples florida have asked for a little help. So i'm off to see if i can lend a [music] hand the couple took on an extensive remodel themselves though lately they're dedicating more time to their competitive showcats including te lars a grand champion abian. But today they're getting back in the do-it-yourself spirit. And have invited me to help accent their beautiful home by installing a decorative wall niche. So this guy here you guys picked this out of a catalog yes we did at our local home improvement store okay. And then it was special it was ordered for it was special ordered okay. And what's this made of lightweight yeah it is it's a highdensity polyurethane foam very pretty it is it's very attractive i think it'll add a lot to that wall this is where you're going to put it absolutely  i can see one problem right. Now you get this is your intercom right here right what are you thinking about doing with that just taking it right out we have an intercom in every other room. And the door is right there. So so you won't miss that one all right i want to hold this up on the wall first all let me actually ste give you that pencil i'm going to hold this up on the wall because i want you guys to get a sense of how high don't worry about centering it oil right. Now but just height that you like. And i i'm going to be the mover up or downer here. So you just tell me i think it should h that's a little high okay that looks good okay you want to mark it steve yep right on top there all right got it after turning off the power at the circuit breaker steve. And lor's first job is to remove the intercom. And light switch they take off the face plates disconnect the wires. And pull the units out meanwhile i locate. And mark both the center point of the niche. And the center point of the wall. So here's the center mark on the niche right here there's the center mark on the wall. So we're just going to put these two together. And that automatically centers the niche in this these are these are the things you don't see on tv right good thing that's polyurethane foam you see way it boun yeah a ball well inadvertently i've made a point here polyurethane is far more durable than the plaster it's designed to mimic with a better grip on things we line up the mark on the niche with the one on the wall. Then while steve. And i hold it in place lori traces the outline onto the wall with a marking pen very nice sisting chapel quality i would say well we've located our studs near this opening that we're about to cut here's one here one here. And one here. And what we're looking at is sort of a a road map of what's behind the wallboard we got a couple of problems the opening as we've originally drawn it kind of falls right on top top of this wall stud over here. And we've got this switch that we've got to deal with this is a switch that's duplicated by another one on the inside of the bathroom we're going to take this one out. But we're left with this opening right here. So our solution to clear this wall stud. And to cover this box with the lip of our niche right here is to move everything to the right just about one inch that'll be enough to accomplish what we want. But not. So much that it appears to be off center. Now before we start cutting into the wall we take a precautionary step steve uses a flashlight. And compact mirror to take a peak inside through the intercom opening to make sure we're clear of any pipes wires or heating ducts over here in this bay between these two studs we don't have an excess port. So we're going to cut one i cut the inspection port with a drywall saw. Then steve confirms that we're clear to make the big cut while steve. And lori go to work with the drywall saws i take a little time getting to know tless lars the first grand champion abian i've ever [music] met okay all finished huh yep okay laori grab right here steve get your hands in here just kind of wiggle it back. And forth a couple times. And pull it off you sure this is what you want to do laori y okay pull it off there you go oh it came off in one piece beautiful a small strip along the edge is still attached to a stud. So we remove it with a pry bar well we're about to take on the most interesting part of this project removing these sections of wall studs right here that are in our opening. Now two things are important here we want to make sure this is not a loadbearing wall what's a load bearing wall well it's a wall that  supports some weight from above usually ceiling joist we went up in the attic. And determined this in fact was not a load bearing wall if you're going to take on a project like this make sure that you do the same in if you don't know. Then that's the time to call in an expert. And have them tell you secondly i want to minimize the damage to the surrounding wall as i'm taking these out. So with that in mind i've drawn some lines down here. And cut some slots just about an inch. And a half below our opening. And i'm going to insert this saw this is called a reciprocating saw because the blade reciprocates back. And forth we're going to put it through this slot right here. And i'm going to cut off the bottom portion of this stud okay steve want to give it a shot sure love to okay these are loose. Now but they are attached with screws that are coming through the drywall from the other side right wallboard. So we're going to u have to kind of pull these out to get a better grip lori. And i attach a couple of clamps to the stud. Then rock it back. And forth okay take the clamps off okay. And see maybe we can drop it down a little bit there we go oh that came out easy stud number one. Now we need to frame out the top. And bottom of our opening with short 2x4s this one at the top called a header is cut for a snug fit. And attached to the cut ends of the studs with 3-in screws the bottom piece called a sill is attached the same way together the header in the sill will secure. And strengthen the cut ends of the studs the only patching we'll need to do before installing our niche is to fill these cutting slots patient is before us yes we are gloved ready to apply the adhesive this is a  polyurethane adhesive the reason bet you guys to put the gloves on is if it gets in your hands it does not come off i apply the adhesive in a serpentine pattern along the lip. And add a few dollops on the back i think we're ready okay maybe we should have done a test fit first oh would have been a good idea oh man here we go how you doing over there pretty good pretty good right i make it how long does it take for that glue to in here glove  about 25 to 30 minutes. Now there are a couple ways to do this we could drive a couple small finish nails in here. But you know this is fitting. So well because you guys did such a perfect job of cutting i think that's going to be fine let's leave it just like that. Now lars this is a niche fit for a championship cat if i ever saw one you look magnificent up up there just majestic oh wait a minute you're not supposed to be up there i guess i guess you're going to be replaced by a vase yes wow. So what do you guys think oh i think it adds great character to a wall that was very hard to put anything on yeah it was too short to really do do much with absolutely couldn't put another piece of furniture there how was it for you doing it i thought it was pretty easy i was a little concerned what we would find when we cut into the wall. And we had the problem with the the wall studs that was easy to overcome in end. So was easier than what i thought was going did a great job cutting those out on the way good steady hand well wall niches are pretty simple to install. And come in a variety of styles. And shapes all said they're a great way to add an elegant architectural element or cat perch to just about any [music],https://youtu.be/9Dui8Z8owjY?t=538,"['What is high-density polyurethane foam used for?', 'How do you determine if a wall is load-bearing?', 'What type of saw is best for cutting through drywall?', 'Why is it important to minimize damage to surrounding walls during renovation?', 'Can you install a decorative wall niche without professional help?']"

But that was back in the days before central air conditioning was as common as it is today. But maybe all that air conditioning has made me a bit soft or spoiled because as comfortable as this room is today for a lot of the year i find it too cold or are too warm out here. So what i want to do is make this into a four seasons room i want to preserve the cross ventilation. And the great views. But i want to be able to use it year round i start my project by prying off the wood stops that are holding the screen panels in place once the inside stops are removed a few taps with a mallet from the outside nudges the panels free. Then i can just lift them out [music] since the porch construction is pretty straightforward eight columns supporting the roof about the only other demolition i have to do is to remove some trim from the [music] posts while i'm finished with theep instruction. Now i want to start the construction. And i want to begin by putting a short wall between the posts about 3 ft high because everything from there up is going to be windows i grab a few 2x4s out of my truck for the sill. And bottom plates. Then cut them to length. So they'll fit between the post the bottom board is pressure treated on top of that i lay a standard 2x four. Then attach the two boards together this carbide tip masonry bit also boards through wood. Now the idea here is to put the boards in place. And drill through just far enough to make a locator mark on the stone below. Then i switch over to a hammer drill also equipped with a masonry bit. And finish boring the holes a piece of tape on the drill shank acts as a depth guide [music] next i drive expansion anchor bolts into the holes i've just drilled to make an airtight seal i lay down a strip of foam insulation. Then slip the screw together 2x4s over the bolts i install washers. And nuts. And tighten everything with a socket wrench as the nuts are tightened the bolts expand inside the hole holes jamming themselves in place. And securing the boards to the floor finally i trim away the excess foam. Then i repeat the process for the other wall sections well my double base plate is in securely fastened to the deck. Now what i'm going to do is build a short wall here complete with a top plate. And studs about every 16 in the end studs are nailed to the post. Then the top plate or sill is set in place i check for level. Then nail it [music] down next i install studs every 16 in or. So making sure their plum are vertical. Then in nail at the top. And toenail at the [music] [music] bottom well that finishes this side of the porch that's a porch for. Now i guess soon to be a room. Now i'm going to do the same thing on this wall. And that that one over there this wall is going to have a glass sliding door all i have to do here is add a couple of 2x4s to reduce the rough opening to the proper size. Now next i want to begin to actually enclose this by applying plywood sheathing on the outside i tilt the sheathing up slide it into position. Then attach it with a clamp. Now this leaves my hand free to work a couple of nails along the top will hold the plywood in place this simple t-square that i've made up from some scrap 1 by tws allows me to quickly draw locator lines for the studs even on a short wall like this it's easy to drift sideways. And miss the framing the lines make sure every nail finds its mark well i've got the beginnings of a wall.

Now this is a water. And air barrier why am i putting it up well i want to keep water rain. And air cold winds from penetrating to the inside of the house while at the same time i want to allow water vapor to pass through the walls to the outside. And not get trapped inside the wall where it could do some damage. Now i've already applied it over here i just got one section left right here this material can be attached either with a conventional staple gun or a hammer tacker the hammer tacker though is a good bit faster. And less tiring on the grip upper pieces are lapped over lower ones. So that flowing water will always be diverted to the front of the strip below. And never directed behind the wrap or it could be trapped. And cause rotting [music] finally i tape all the seams with a material designed just for that purpose well i guess this is why they call it home wrap well the walls are in good shape. Now i'm going to do the same for the window. And door openings this aluminum tape will create a watertight. And weathertight seal i apply it to the sills. And run it up the sides about 8 in [music] i cut it. So that it can be wrapped around the corners. And finally folded over the [music] edges i apply a second strip of tape to the rear of the seill in the same [music] way my new windows come with a metal flange that must be bent outward. So that it's perpendicular to the window frame the weathertight seal comes from a beat of caulk that's applied to the inside of the flange. Now installing these windows at least the larger ones is definitely a two-person job. So i recruit my neighbor peter to come over. And lend me a hand after setting the bottom of the window on the finished opening we just tilt it up into position wow like a glove huh hey it looks great you know i'm really lucky to have a neighbor like you thanks i've got work at my house next yeah well turnouts fair play i owe you one thanks appreciate it at the top i make sure the house wrap laps over the flange. Then nail the window in place well i can't let peter go yet the sliding glass door is even larger than the window. But the installation is pretty much the same drill with the windows. And doors in it's time to begin adding some exterior trim starting with the sills notice the grip groove in the bottom it'll prevent water from clinging to the underside. And running down behind the shingles i first clamp the wood in place. Then secure it with [music] screws adjoining sections are overlapped using a mitered scarf joint screw holes are counter sunk. So the screw heads can later be concealed with exterior [music] spackle above the windows i'm installing some flat trim the galvanized finish nails i'm using are being driven just below the surface. So they too can be concealed with spackle before painting a piece of cornice molding adds a nice bit of detail where the eaves meet the wall.

Now it's on to shingling i tack a strip of 1 by two in place as a sort of ledge. Then simply set each shingle on the board. And tack it tempor in place this speeds things up. And allows me to make sure the bottom edge of each course is perfectly [music] straight once an entire row is set i strike a chalk line as a nailing guide. And permanently attach each shingle with two galvanized nails [music] these windows are state-of-the-art as good as they get when it comes to sealing around the edges. And insulation two pieces of glass with a space in between filled with argon gas. And inert gas. Now that helps keep warm heated air from passing through in the winter. And keeps the hot air outside in the summer. So i've done about as good as i can do in terms of insulation up here. Now it's time to take care of the wall down here i'll use bats of insulation cut to fit each [music] bay after stapling these in place all i need to do is to cut out the openings for the electrical receptacles the power of course is turned off this paper on the back of the insulation is a vapor barrier it's intended to prevent water vapor from passing into the wall cavity. Now when you're putting insulation like this up make sure the vapor barrier is facing the interior living space as it is [music] here next it's time for the drywall. Now when it comes to driving screws for wallboard you'll never get faster than this this driver holds a strip of 50 screws it's a one-handed operation that goes about as fast as i can pull the trigger [music] to finish the wallboard i first cover the recessed screw heads with joint [music] compound. Then apply a coat of compound to the joints themselves. Now i like to wet my paper tape before applying it for me it sticks better. And i seem to be able to avoid air bubbles [music] i lay the tape along the [music] joint. Then press it into the compound keeping the knife at a shallow angle taping usually requires two or three coats of compound each one being applied with a whiter knife i tape the corners the same way first applying a bedding coat of compound here here though i fold the tape before dipping it in the water. And lay the crease into the corner of the wall. Then press each flap of the tape into the compound using the putty knife the last step for me is to trim out the windows on the inside the cordless nailer i'm using requires no compressor no fuel cells. And and will drive up to 1,000 nails on a single battery [music] charge well that finishes up this room when the weather's good i can open all these windows pull down the screens.

And you can't back it out well. Now there's a solution to this. And i think you're going to find it very interesting. Now this is a new screw removal tool it's called a grabbit has two different ends a reamer on this end. And the remover itself on this end to use the screw remover i first loaded into my cordless drill with the reamer end out. Then set the forward reverse switch to reverse. And apply moderate pressure as the ramer quickly cuts a con shaped depression in the screw head. Then i loosen the drill chuck. And reverse the tool. So the mover in protrudes. Now the trick here is to start the drill slowly again in reverse apply a bit of pressure. And voila out comes the screw well i'd say that worked pretty well didn't it. Now these come in two sizes one for large screws. And one for small. And i'd say with a set of these in your pocket well stripped screw problems are a thing of the past,https://youtu.be/09z7Lso0J64?t=939,"['What is a Grabbit?', 'How does a Grabbit work?', 'What is the purpose of a reamer on a Grabbit?', 'Can you use a Grabbit with any type of drill?', 'Are there different sizes of Grabbits available?']"

And these guys don't get any water also i've got several different situations container plants back here foundation plants over here. And flowering plants. So what i'm going to do is install an automatic drip irrigation system it'll water the plants even if i'm not home.

And take into account their individual requirements as much as 2third of the water used in our homes is actually used outside taking care of our yard. And plant. And drip irrigation can show as much as a 70% water savings over other methods also studies have shown that plant material grows as much as 50% faster using drip irrigation my drip irrigation system is going to start right here with this hose bib or faucet. Now the first thing i want to do is screw on this check valve it's designed to keep the irrigation water out here from flowing inside the house. And contaminating my household water supply tightening this set screw will keep vibration or maybe even the kids from loosening the valve the next thing i want to do is turn this single faucet right here into four using what's called a hose bib manifold. Now these are pressure reducers in a lot of homes water pressure can run 60 80 some places even over 100 lb per square inch that's way too much pressure for a drip irrigation system. So what this device does is drop it down from household pressure to something in the 20 to 25 lb range in the area that i've decided to irrigate there are several different kinds of plants with different water requirements. So i've set up three areas or zones. And each one of them is going to be served by one of these outlets this fourth one over here will be for my garden hose. Now remember in my case i want the water to come on. And turn off automatically. So the next step for me is to install or in this case just screw on an automatic valve these electronic valves operate using very low voltage they'll turn the water on. And off for each zone when they're instructed to do. So now this is the brain behind my automatic drip irrigation system it's called a timer or controller it's completely weatherproof battery operated. And each of these automatic valves will plug into the bottom like this. And then the controller itself mounts on the front of one of the valves. Now i'm going to program this. And it will tell each of these automatic valves which day of the week to turn on which time of the day to come on. And how long to run well i'm finished with the work on my water source. Now i need to set up a distribution system to get the water from the valves to where it's needed that water highway if you will is halfin polyethylene tubing,https://youtu.be/6JkDj0Dn22c?t=109,"['What type of devices are used to reduce high household water pressure for drip irrigation systems?', 'How much water savings can be achieved with drip irrigation compared to other methods?', 'What percentage increase in plant growth has been observed using drip irrigation?', 'Why is it necessary to install a check valve when setting up a drip irrigation system?', 'What type of tubing is used as the ""water highway"" for distributing water from valves to plants?']"

And make it more pliable. And two invest in a pair of these cutters one end of the tubing i connect to the automatic valves in my case since i have fairly deep mulch in my beds i'm going to lay the tubing on top of the ground. So all i'll have to do is rake a path. Then use tubing stakes to anchor the run in [music] place. Now when you reach the end of a run of tubing like this you have to close or cap it off there are a couple of ways to do that one is to take a figure8 clip like this slip it over the tubing bend the tubing. And then slide the clip back up to keep it in position sort of like you'd bend a garden hose to stop the flow of water another way to end a run of tubing is with a cap like this when winter weather comes i can just unscrew the cover. And drain the lines this halfin polyethylene tubing brings water into a general area. And this smaller quarin tubing delivers it to individual plants or groups of plants to attach the smaller tubing to the large i first use a special punch to make a small hole. Then snatch in a connector next i slip on a piece of/ quin tubing. And cut it to length on the ends of the tubing go the emitters small nozzles if you will that emit different amounts of water anywhere from 1 to four gallons per hour in a variety of patterns drip emitters like this are extremely efficient delivering water directly to the base of the plant ms sprays. And sprinklers are often mounted on higher stes. And distribute water in quarter circle half circle full circle even rectangular patterns just one of these can water several plants at once for my container plants here i'm going to use something called soaker tubing the water actually penetrates through the wall. Now it's very easy to use i start by putting a te in the end of the quarter inch tubing like this place one end of the soaker tubing on one arm of the ke lay the soaker tube around the base of the plant cut it to length. And then hook the end of the tube on the other arm of the [music] te. Now for my hanging plants i'm going to use this flexible [music] mis with this part of my ear irrigation system in place. And ready to go to work i can rake the mulch back over the tubing making it invisible yet accessible the tubing can also be buried usually a trench just a few inches deep is adequate since the line is not under pressure freezing is usually not a concern the simplest way to run tubing across grass is to make an angled cut through the turf using a flat garden spade. Then lever the side upward to create a shallow groove set the tubing in the bottom of the cut. And press the grass back into place this is called a sidewalk tunneling tool it's simply a plastic nozzle attached to a length of pvc pipe with a hose connected to the opposite end the stream of water actually bores a hole under the sidewalk once i'm through i use a pair of pvc pipe cutters to snip off the nozzle. And the hose connector the plastic pipe stays in place. And acts as a conduit i just push the irrigation tubing through it well i'm up early this morning. But not as early as my automatic irrigation system you know it's good to know that even if i'm on the road or i want to sleep in late these guys are not going to suffer because of it [music],https://youtu.be/6JkDj0Dn22c?t=268,"[""['What is halfin polyethylene tubing used for?', 'How do you warm up and make more pliable halfin polyethylene tubing?', 'What are some common ways to cap off a run of tubing?', 'What type of tubing delivers water to individual plants or groups of plants?', 'How does soaker tubing work with te's in the end?']""]"

Now if this doesn't work you might try a screw extractor first drill a small hole in the head of the screw. Then insert the extractor.

And u as you can see right. Now it looks fairly  undone unfinished. So i really wanted a nice entertainment center. So everything could have a proper place for it okay rita's living room has an al cove that's the perfect place for the kind of entertainment center she has in mind she wants something that looks builtin. And can house her tvs stereo cds books. And of course frames little chachies little ornaments that's not what tvs look like these days is it. Now it's time to sit down. And draw a rough sketch the base section will have doors. And drawers for lots of out ofsight storage on top we'll build three cabinets with adjustable shelving finally to give our project that built-in look what we want to do is is put this in place. And then trim out the way i see it the edge of it right here all the way around with molding that would look great. So that it looks like it was it's built into the unit to save time. And money. And a lot of work we construct the base from stock kitchen cabinets purchased at the nearby home improvement center the cabinets are first clamped together. Then secured with screws on each end we attach a filler strip to conceal the space between the cabinets. And the wall. Now it's the same with the drill the further you pull the trigger the faster the blade goes before setting the base section in place we cut holes in the back of the cabinets to give us access to the electrical outlets. And tv cable jack in the wall boring holes through the sides of the cabinets will allow us to run wires wherever we need them next we measure for the countertop. So all the way to the corner okay 79. And 3/4 okay good. And now let's measure from the wall 29 and2 okay transfer those measurements to a sheet of 3/4 in plywood okay want to cut here to be at 21. Then it's time for rita to confront the tool she's most uncomfortable using okay have you ever used one of these before no are you concerned about using this. So a little bit are you yeah keep going there you go all right there you go beautiful straight cut good how was that not. So bad not. So scary although you rita's first cutting job results in a near perfect fit a piece of 1x8 popler notched to fit around the corners conceals the edge of the plywood push it all the way down. And then just pull the trigger like that good gravy. Then it's time for a shot with a nail gun. Now if we were building a wet bar or a built in sideboard you know we could stop right here or we'd have to put on a better countertop maybe plastic lamet or even granite. But the point is this is a great way to get a built-in run of base cabinets like this using off-the-shelf kitchen cabinets you can see that these went together in a very short time. And they cost us less than $300. But we're not stopping here we're building an entertainment center it's going to go all the way up. So now let's move on to the next section the upper portion of our entertainment center will be made in three sections a a center section for the tv. And two side sections for books audio gear. And collectibles using the circular saw. And a clamp on straight edge as a guide we cut the sides bottoms. And tops from sheets of 3/4 in birch veneer plywood. Now the upper section of our entertainment center is going to have adjustable shelves they're going to be supported on pins just like these. And these pins are going to be set into a series of holes. Now two things are really important here these holes have to start at the same point usually near the bottom. And they have to be spaced precisely the same distance apart. Now here's how we've been drilling those holes. So accurately after measuring. And drawing a baseline i align. And clamp a pre-drilled plastic template to the cabinet side using a self-centering drill bit i. Then drill a series of holes about 2/3 of the way through the wood the process is. Then repeated on all of the cabinet sides the face of the this cabinet grade plywood is smooth. And clean. But like most plywood the edges are rough. And unfinished to conceal them i apply edge banding a thin strip of wood with a heat activated adhesive backing once it's trimmed. And sanded it'll make these plywood panels look like solid wood we're going to face the edges of our shelves with a solid piece of 1x two lumber this edging will make the shelves more rigid. And will give them a thicker more substantial appearance well it's time for some assembly. And we're going to start with this n section right here i've laid all the pieces out on the table. Now we're going to glue. And nail these together. But to help us position these pieces for assembly. And to make the unit stronger you're going to be using these wooden biscuits or splines the biscuits are set into slots cut with this machine called a plate joiner which can be rented or purchased for as little as $100 once the jointer has cut the slot glue is applied. And a biscuit or spline is inserted with the biscuits in place more glue is applied to the surface of the wood. And the pieces are pressed together just put put them right in the slots with the splines holding everything in the correct position the two pieces are nailed a lot of things that we've done. So far it's just a matter of watching once how it's done. And then i can become a pro because that's all you need basically is you need to be shown how to do something. And then once you have that information that knowledge. Then you can do it yourself here we go complete this same assembly process for all three upper cabinets. And carry each one back into the house very nice job slight place okay very slowly great job good job after securing the cabinet together with screws we cut trim strips. And attach them to the front edge of the cabinets to conceal the [music] joint. Now r gets a chance to try out the power miter saw as she cuts the molding or casing that will give the entire unit that built-in look finally it's time to mount the cabinet doors install the drawers. And set the shelves into position okay beautiful boy let's time me take a look at this this came out. So nice i know we did it. But i i must say it really turned out nicely you know what was the most satisfying thing for you on this project i think seeing it all put together at the end it's it's a little hard to imagine sometimes just seeing the different parts. And pieces. But when it's all pulled together you really you really see what it is. And i got to tell you this really changes the personality of the entire room remember back what it looked like with that just hole here it's horrible. And now what it looks like. And it changed your personality too it did yes you have a tool personality.

So what's the first thing you got to do first thing we got to do is we have to mount the tv until.

And the other for electrical receptacle that will provide power to the tv in all there will be six separate pieces of equipment in our home theater system. And that could mean six individual remote controls fortunately that won't be the case because shawn is setting us up with this universal remote that will replace all the others the universal remote control will communicate with a master sensor that receives. And relays signals not only to the tv. But all the other electron components as well i need you to hold the remote like you normally would i probably hold it something like this because of that i would probably go with under the tv set all right.

Now wow is this what people refer to a surround sound yes it is these three speakers are going to go on the front wall these two rear speakers are going to go on the rear wall. And this subwoofer will be hidden behind the sofa where you can't see it okay a height of a speaker can make a difference in the sound you want it to be between the ear standing. And the ear sitting somewhere in that general area i would place it about here or here on this shelf. But unfortunately we have kids in the house. And they could pull the speaker off the wall. And that would be dangerous you might want to consider here as long as we have a speaker bracket that can tilt it down it'll make up for that height difference. So you can take them high. But point them downward correct i definitely think i want them out of reach great. Now let me ask you something is it necessary to have the speakers at the same height all the way around the room well not only should they be the same height. But they should be the same speaker. And they should be the same amount of power all the way around the room to mount the speakers a,https://youtu.be/OXzbW3LPIFo?t=230,"['What is the normal holding position for the fish tape?', 'Why are sensors tied to the string?', 'How do electrical wires get pulled into the wall?', 'Is it necessary to have speakers at the same height and power level in a home theater?', 'What type of bracket should be used to secure speakers out of reach from children?']"

Then a fish tape is inserted into the wall cavity. And fed into the basement the speaker wire is attached. And pulled up into the room [music] above next the mounting bracket is screwed to the wall the wires are connected the speaker is fastened to the bracket. And aimed toward the seating area this is 5.1 surround sound that means there will be five wall speakers three across the front. And two in the rear the 0.1 is a six speaker for low frequency effects like the boom of an explosion called a subwoofer it will sit on the floor to install it sha first drills a hole the wiring is. Then passed down into the [music] basement the circuitry in the subwoofer controls the timing of the sound signals to all the wall speakers in short that means a whole lot of wires. Now it's time to gather up the wires from the television wall speakers. And subwoofer. And bring them into the equipment cabinet right. Now all that wiring is in the basement ready to come [music] upstairs okay push okay got [music] it. Now i'm pretty adventurous as a do it yourselfer. But one look at this electronic spaghetti has made me very glad i've let a pro tackle this job with everything hooked up it's time to do some programming first sha measures the distance from each speaker to the primary seating area that's 15. Then he enters this data into the onscreen setup program the system will use this information to automatically adjust each speaker volume to produce a true surround sound effect all rong you're all set.

But it also ushers in something that evokes not ooze. And oz. But ouches yep we're talking about mosquitoes in the past i like my young friends here have tackled this problem with plenty of mosquito repellent. But this season i'm going to take a different approach i plan to eliminate them completely that's right i just won't have any i'll show you how i plan to do this. But first a few interesting. And useful facts about mosquitoes only the female mosquitoes bite they can lay hundreds of eggs in a few tablespoons of water mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide. And the odors that emanate from our skin some of us smell better to mosquitoes than others mosquitoes typically fly into the wind in search of a human meal ouch armed with this information. And more scientists at american biophysics corporation came up with a way for homeowners like me to rid ourselves of these pests simply put this device does a better job of attracting mosquitoes than we do this device aptly named the mosquito magnet connects to a standard tank of propane when the unit is turned on the propane gas is burned in a flameless catalytic converter producing carbon dioxide yep the same co2 we generate an internal fan powered in this case by a solar battery exhausts the carbon dioxide through this nozzle the co2 which is heavier than air hugs the ground. And travels downwind where blood hungry female mosquitoes pick up the scent they follow the plume back to the unit. And are sucked inside where the they're trapped. And starved to death every few days i'll simply open the unit. And empty out the collection [music] bag to make itself even more irresistible the mosquito magnet uses an attractant that's expelled along with the carbon dioxide this combination of co2. And scent is just too much for any bloodthirsty lady mosquito to resist a single device can cover up to an acre. And a half the unit should be placed up wind. So it can attract biting insects away from the areas where people gather the good news is mosquitoes don't migrate. So all i've got to do is to get rid of those that are in my yard. And that'll take about 4 weeks. But i'm going to keep this running throughout the summer just in case any neighboring mosquitoes decide to blow in. And if they do they'll be more attracted to this magnet than this [music],https://youtu.be/OXzbW3LPIFo?t=778,"['What is unique about female mosquitoes?', 'How many eggs can a female mosquito lay in a few tablespoons of water?', 'Why are mosquitoes typically drawn into the wind?', 'How does the Mosquito Magnet device work?', 'How long will it take to get rid of all mosquitoes in your yard?']"

Now some say you can never have too many clamps. And i guess if you look around my shop you'd say i'm living proof of that. But despite the fact that i've got dozens of these sometimes i still don't have just the right one that's when it's time to do some creative clamping. Now here's a good example let's say i have a piece of loose veneer right in the center of a panel like this. Now even these clamps won't come close to reaching that point. So here's a solution i take a small block of wood place it right on the loose veneer on top of that i put a strip of wood that's long enough to reach to the edge of the panels. Then i drop one clamp over here. And a second over here. And as i tighten this up i'm applying pressure exactly where i want it example two let's say that i want to clamp these two boards together. But the biggest clamp i've got is not long enough to reach across them well here's the solution take the first clamp lay it on the board take a second clamp. And interlock it with the first. Now what i've done is turn two short clamps into one longer one. Now sometimes one of the most challenging clamping jobs is holding something vertical while you work on it well here's one thing that works pretty well take a sliding c clamp like this. And clamp it near the bottom on both ends. Then clamp the clamps to the tabletop or workbench. Now both my hands are free. So i can go ahead. And work did you know you can create a clamp from just about any board by cutting it on the diagonal. And screwing it down to a base. Now here's how it works let's say i want to clamp this board i slide this piece in give it a tap on this end this is held securely in place if i want to take it out just tap on this end.

But marcy prefers to use a paste activator rather than just water to guarantee a good bond we apply the activator with a roller. Then fold the pasted sides together a process called booking leaving the pasted surfaces in contact with each other for a few minutes before application ensures the adhesive is thoroughly moistened. And ready to go strips are unfolded positioned on the wall. And pressed in place using a wallpaper squeegee marcy trims the ends using a wide putty knife. And a very sharp knife meanwhile i step outside. And start setting up the saw for the molding we'll soon be cutting. Now what i've done here is make a work support system for the power miter saw the reason is that we're going to be cutting several pieces of molding to exactly the same length here's how it's going to work first of all let's say we want to cut a piece 42 inches long i'd measure down from the blade 42 inches right here. And then take this piece of wood which i call a stop block put it right on that mark clamp it in place. And for my molding i just simply set it on here slide the end of the molding up against the stop block. Then go ahead. And make my cut before we start cutting in earnest though we paint all of our molding pre-painting will save us a lot of tedious work later on [music] okay guys that's great. So these are all the vertical pieces cut this is the chair rail we're going to be putting this up next it'll have to have miters on the end too where it goes to the inside corners maybe cut something like this the there'll be one on each end they'll go together like this. And then give us a nice finished inside look all the horizontal pieces of molding will be nailed into wall studs marcy locates.

And marks the studs using an electronic stud finder okay. Now you see where the wall studs are yeah i'll tell you what i'll put the first nail in right here okay a pneumatic nail gun is by far the fastest. And easiest way to attach molding. And we don't have to worry about dents from a missed hammer blow air nailers can be rented or purchased these days you can find an entire system for under 150 dollars. Now on this piece we were able to catch three studs john on the verticals there are no studs. So we're gonna have to rely on some construction adhesive here. So i usually like put just a dot every few inches on this we'll still nail these vertical pieces. But just to keep them in place until the glue dries the real holding power comes from the glue marcy wants a frame above the fireplace in the center of which she plans to hang a circular mirror john these are corner blocks or plinth blocks i'm gonna set right here nice thing about these john is that they you don't have to cut any miters with these we'll lay this in [music] okay john.

And the lure of santa fe combined with a chance to play that piano was more than i could resist you know from the outside this is a pretty typical southwestern home in here there's a few touches of traditional you want to sort of expand on that yes i do that's what i like. And you were thinking about some some detailing up on the top of the walls here yes i was thinking that  it would look really nice with some crown molding yeah we might pick up on this. And and add some crown moldings around the ceiling up here. And maybe even something on top of the fan here maybe a rosette something like that just to bring out a few more traditional details. Now this is a pretty typical piece of crown molding. And it could go right up in the corner just like this. But the seatings in this room are pretty high. And i want something a little bit more substantial. So we're going to attach flat baseboard to both the wall. And the ceiling. Then install the crown molding in between the two this mock-up i've made shows how much more substantial the molding will be we'll want to attach the molding to studs. And ceiling joists wherever we can. So cindy. And i use electronic stud finders to locate. And mark each stud. And joist with that done we move out to the garage to give cindy her first experience using a sliding compound miter saw our first cuts are for the baseboards that will be applied to the ceiling the ends of these boards are cut at 45 degree angles in order to be cleanly in the corners of the room with the blade rotated to 45 degrees cindy makes the miter cuts for each corner [music]. Now every place that we located a wall stud we have put a piece of masking tape. And every place we've located a ceiling joist we've also put a piece of tape you can see them all the way down along the ceiling here. Now the first piece of molding that we're going to put up though we're going to put on this ceiling over here. And because the joists run in this direction all we've got is the edge of one joist right here to nail to. So we're going to have to rely on some construction adhesive to hold this first piece up all the way up press it into the wall push it into the wall. And then up onto the ceiling like this good next i use an air nailer to drive nails into the edge of the joist okay. Now out here where we've only got the construction adhesive i'm going to put in two nails at opposing angles one like this. And one like this that's going to give me a mechanical hold not really strong. But strong enough until the glue dries with the baseboard attached to the ceiling cindy lines up the miter cut on the second piece. And i secure it by driving two nails into each joist while miter cuts are used for each corner we need a different type of joint where two sections of baseboard meet in the middle of the ceiling or wall rather than joining them end to end to form a butt joint we're going to put 45 degree bevels on each end forming what is known as a scarf joint that will effectively hide the seam unlike the miter cut where the saw blade was rotated to a 45 degree angle the scarf joint requires the blade to be tilted to 45 degrees after they're cut the two beveled ends simply slip into place nails can be driven through both boards locking them together cindy. And i work our way around the living room attaching the baseboards to the ceiling. And walls our next step is to do some prep work,https://youtu.be/JvxhSALulCk?t=0,"['What type of materials are typically used for traditional southwestern homes?', 'How does the author plan to attach the crown molding to the wall and ceiling?', 'What is the purpose of using construction adhesive in this project?', 'Can you explain the difference between a miter cut and a scarf joint?', 'Why do the authors need to use 45-degree bevels on each end of the baseboard for the scarf joint?']"

And along the top. And bottom edge where it meets the baseboards after it's all up we run a bead of caulk over the joints. And cover the nail holes with spackle. Then cindy gets to work painting. Now while cindy's finishing up the painting i want to take this opportunity to bring some of that detail we put up here in the corner over to the center of the room by installing a ceiling medallion right above this fan. And while i'm at it i'm going to change this fan to something that's a little bit more in keeping with the new look in this room. Now we've turned off the power with the circuit breaker.

Now these are some of the sealy medallions i picked up generally speaking the higher the ceiling the larger the room the larger the object that you're going to hang underneath the larger the medallion. But truthfully any of these would probably work in this room. So you have a preference here well i think i like this big one in the middle okay. Then that's the one we'll use great while cindy returns to painting i drill four pilot holes through the medallion which is made of lightweight molded plastic.

And there are options when you're renovating to help keep ceilings high. And make life simple for you as a diyer we're going to jump into all of this product. And remember if you check out the video description our supplier gta electric has arranged for 20 discount for you i know it's covered. And it's difficult shipping to the united states.

Now believe it or not led lights were not originally designed to try to save the planet. And reduce energy led lights were originally designed because we had a single problem in the construction business. And that was traditional lights which were halogen or incandescent were too hot. And there are a lot of building situations where we would have an open door in a basement for instance with a low ceiling. And the lights would set the door on fire because they got too hot. And so they came up with this slim line lights. Now this is a solution for a problem this can be installed in the drywall. And all you need in addition to this is enough space to slide this box okay they connect together here like. So so if you're in a basement for instance we'll just pick on basements for a little bit. And you have your hot air. And your cold air line there's usually a gap in between the two you can actually wire this box slide it in between the gap okay. And when you're done you can cut your hole connect your line. And then snap in the fixture with only a half an inch of space between the ducks. And the drywall that is a brilliant way to keep the height in your basement. And make it feel more like a normal room without having to make big bulk heads which we used to have to do if we wanted to have lights in those areas. So you got an options. Now you can put these lights over top of where doors or bar cabinets or other things like that. And you don't have to worry about heat transfer because this is low voltage. And it doesn't generate enough heat to cause a problem at all all right that's a traditional light. And they're brilliant. Now these lights are also just for full disclosure they have a gasket on them okay if you leave this gasket on it when you install the light up against your ceiling in a bathroom for instance that seals up against the drywall. And now this is a wet area approved light because there's nothing here to open there's no moisture that can get through that lens you can put these directly in your shower you can put them in the ceiling in your bathroom. And don't worry about steam all right as long as you leave that gasket on you're good to go okay the other thing that these lights can do is they can go into your ceiling if it's an insulated attic space building code. And electrical code allows us to just cut the hole snap this into the drywall we don't need any vapor barrier protection in there or anything okay you can just slide all this up into the attic. And you are good to go. So retrofitting an existing space. And adding some lights in an attic is easy all you got to do is fish a wire from that center light put it to the four corners of the room. And you can add pot lighting to your room absolutely brilliant some of the information we got today goes really well with another video we just recently did we talked about all my tips. And tricks within the electrical aisle we'll put a link to that video over here. But you can actually add pot lights to a room. And cancel out the center light all you need is a cover plate. And a couple of my favorite tricks that are in that video. And you'll be able to do that too definitely worth a look,https://youtu.be/dxfq4pZfUrU?t=62,"['What was the original purpose of LED lights?', 'Why were traditional incandescent lights replaced with LED lights?', 'How did LED lights solve a problem in the construction industry?', 'Can LED lights be installed in areas with high moisture levels?', 'Are there any specific building codes or regulations for installing LED lights in attics?']"

And so understanding what your options are while you're in your planning phase can really help you to understand options that you never thought were available for. And opportunities to gain space that you didn't know were there before brilliant one of the benefits of this particular light it's very strange. But you're going to love this idea it has a switch on it here this switch toggles between three different color temperatures absolutely brilliant max just had his mind blown. So you can pick a incandescent light color if you have other lights in the room. And you want to add more light you can go yep incandescent you can go to regular daylight or you can go to bright white four thousand five thousand three thousand k all in the switch. And if you change the design. And the feel of the room down the road you just pop these out of the ceiling pull down your switch. And you can change your color temperature to match the color in the room the kind of lighting you're going with. And you don't have any conflict. So let's say you're doing a renovation. And i'm a daylight guy i like 4000k i buy 4000k lights i put them all throughout the house. And i got a protect potential buyer they come through they're like yeah. But i just wish that we had a different color light temperature in these 40 pot lights are in your ceiling i'm like no problem i'll open up the ceiling. And i'll change all the color to the temperature that you prefer boom mind blown right there house sold think about it. And i'm warning those lights i think are two dollars more,https://youtu.be/dxfq4pZfUrU?t=243,"['What is the benefit of having a switch that toggles between different color temperatures?', 'How does changing the design and feel of a room affect the need to change light bulbs?', 'Why would someone want to change the color temperature of their ceiling lights during a renovation?', 'What is the advantage of being able to choose from incandescent, daylight, and bright white light options?', 'How can having multiple light sources with different color temperatures be useful in a home renovation?']"

And i'm warning those lights i think are two dollars more. But it's definitely worth it if you need to have that kind of flexibility all right next option that we have in the world of pot lights. And this is awesome you're going to love this we've had a lot of different options when it came to gimbal lights which is what i mean by you have a light fixture. And it can change direction a little bit you know. So traditional gimbal light gave you like 22 degrees which means instead of light shining down it shined a little bit to the side okay. Now prepare to have your mind blown if you put it in the ceiling that's 45 degrees. And you want the light shining straight down. Now that's not a problem. Now we can go straight down okay ready for this this particular light has the ability to go to a full 87 degrees that's almost a perfect 90. Boom shine light right on a wall. Now zero limitation with where you want to put light in any scenario this is also a solid dome it's vapor proof safe for wet areas it's also safe for in insulated spaces. So it's icy rated as well no vapor barrier no boxes no cans just wire it up shove it in the ceiling snap it in boom it's got the gasket on as well this light can do anything anywhere anytime again a couple bucks more. But man if you've got a vaulted angled ceiling. And you want to put pot lighting in there before all you could do is just shine it across the room. Now you can direct that light to put it exactly where you want highlight anything you want to do telling you this is the game changer now,https://youtu.be/dxfq4pZfUrU?t=330,"['What are some options for gimbal lights?', 'How does a traditional gimbal light work?', 'Can pot lights be used in wet areas?', 'What is the advantage of using a dome-shaped pot light?', 'How can pot lighting be directed to highlight specific areas?']"

Now i'm going to save my favorite light here to last. So you're going to have to enjoy the rest of this video. But this is going to be a game changer if you are a homeowner. And you're gonna do a basement renovation. And you're one of these people who just isn't comfortable with drywall. And there's a lot of people who aren't comfortable with drywall. And i get it we do some really great drywall videos right. And so i'll put a link up here for people who are interested in learning about drywall. But if drywall is just not a skill you want to get good at. Then you can definitely renovate a basement using a drop ceiling. And now. Now they make a light just for you this is set exactly the right height you build your drop ceiling grid you can slide it up drop it in. And you have an led light in the room. So you can make this as a central room light or you can pop these down a hallway every six or eight feet. And you can have hidden led lights in your drop ceiling they're low profile. So they're really easy to install. And you don't need any more than the traditional three inch clearance from your floor joist to your grid to be able to install these absolutely brilliant the best thing about this is if you don't like where the light is you can install it if you're smart with a little extra wire. And you can move it from one part of the grid to the next. So it can fit the design of the room you can move your furniture. And then reposition your lights absolutely brilliant way to go tons of flexibility. And great lighting. Now here's the thought for everybody who has a drop ceiling in their basement. Now the grid size has not changed size over the years which is mind-blowing to me because everything else in construction changes. But they're still going with a very standard two foot by two foot or two foot by four foot pattern. And all of those parts are available in your local store to lock in together if you have an existing ceiling. And you've got big box square can lights like those old nine by nine inches. And you got to put in your bulb. And they got a little piece of loose glass just floating there. And you want to upgrade you can actually remove that one ceiling panel you can go to the local store. And get a replacement panel if it's a two by two foot you can get a bar. And drop that in. And replace it with one of these all right the wire that runs to that light is going to have no problem getting to this connection here on the top okay because it can go in any corner it's not restricted. So if you have any existing light right. Now you can take it out of the ceiling install one of these bad boys in your new ceiling. And wire it up to what's existing okay you don't even need a permit for that you're just changing a fixture. And any homeowner can change a fixture black to black white to white make sure to secure your ground. And you're good to go. And once you've done that consider the option see all these extra ports you can connect even more. And more. And more lights in your basement. And then you can change your switch to a dimmer because this new technology can be dimmed as well. And then you've got all the light or all the sexy comfort that you're looking for in your family room,https://youtu.be/dxfq4pZfUrU?t=427,"['What is the main topic of the video?', 'How does a drop ceiling work?', 'Can you install LED lights in an existing drop ceiling?', 'Do you need a permit to replace a fixture with a new LED light?', 'What are some benefits of using a drop ceiling instead of drywall for basement renovation?']"

And there are solar led options which are nice. But generally speaking in the northern climate we get enough sunshine. And battery life. So you can have the lights turn on for a couple hours while you entertain. And then that's it. But if you want light on all the time you can put it on a timer or on a switch. And attach it to regular power. Now this here is a brand new kind of light. And i'm going to just take a second.

And so we're going to show you how to assemble all these things. So you don't want to miss out on all that fun action. Now this is a brand new world it looks like a fluorescent light. But it's actually an led strip i'm actually putting this in my closet inside i'm gonna have an eight foot long closet. And so it'll be above my head in my closet when i open the door i'm going to have a switch on my door boom turns on. Now check this out this is a new wave again color correction technology you can pick the color to match the colors in the room this is brilliant you can take any room. And add accent lighting with this led strip pick the color that match whatever lighting is in your room. And you can light up any space that you feel necessary of course you can hot wire direct. And you put on a light switch if you want. But for me i'm going to go with an automatic control. And now it's time for my favorite light this is a brand new slimline led [applause] this thing is amazing. Now i am doing a project in my master bedroom i'm vaulting my ceiling a little bit just you know go from 8 to 13 feet nothing too dramatic. And we're putting in a whole bank of closet 17 linear feet of closet space it's going to be six massive doors. And every time i open up a door i'd have to have six switches attached to the light in just that area or i've got this option all right i'm gonna have a vaulted ceiling. And then a flat piece of ceiling i'm putting in these lights. And check this out that's a motion sensor i know it's almost too ridiculous right we're going to set up the control. And we're going to put one of these lights in front of every door. And then anytime you open a door motion center goes off the light goes on all right. And if you forget to turn the lights off when you go to bed the lights will turn themselves off anyway this is a great way to go because it only uses the power when you need it right.

And i love to read all your questions. And concerns because they give me ideas for you know what there's a great idea for a concept of video. So today's video is actually to answer a bunch of questions around toilets. So if you own a toilet or you plan on using one in the future you're going to want to watch this video to understand all the different problems you're going to run into as a homeowner. And your options to fix it because not every time that you're going to find water or a leak or a problem surrounding your toilet it doesn't necessarily mean there's a disaster sometimes it just means you need a little bit of maintenance. So we're going to separate the difference between when you're in real trouble. And when you just need to update some of your plumbing equipment. So before we get into the toilet issue itself i want to deal with the number one cause of water dripping around your toilet. And that is the shutoff valve. And here's why i've got three different options on my table here today truth is there are a bunch more different combinations of it this is what we would call a 90 degree angle. And the idea of this is the water supply is coming out of the wall. And then it goes up to go to the toilet okay here's an example of a straight valve the idea here is the water supply is coming through the floor. And then going to the toilet here's another example it's a straight valve as well. But it's different. And we're going to go through all the differences. And things you need to know they make shutoff valves for a combination of all the different materials that are used to make the connections all right. So they make it. So that you have water supply for through pecs. And it's barbed like that. So you slide the pecs over top. And put on a crimp ring. And then on the top there's 3 8 outside diameter threaded the purpose of this is that if you want to go to the store. And buy like the flexible braided line that's the size that this connects to 3 8 od okay. So when you're shopping you can get your half inch pecks to a 3 8 od. And that's how you would assemble your toilet. Now if you don't want to go with a flexible line. And you want to buy one of those great pieces of plastic to go to direct to the toilet you can. And what you do is you would slide that plastic on there into that hole you slide this over top. And then you actually would make a compression fitting right here that's uncommon almost every homeowner i've ever known wants to use a braided faucet line because it's simple. And it gives you lots of flexibility if you're going to start using those plastic pipes yes they're cheaper. But you've got to be exact. And you've got to be a lot more confident with what you're doing. Now this one is designed. So you can actually have a half inch solder joint inside they've also got this whole array of fittings here. So you can put that over top okay all right the point is is you want to read on your package because it'll tell you what's what's what the intake is. And what the out outside is. Now be careful when you're buying your shut off valve because they also make these same valves for things like refrigerators. And that's different they actually have quarter inch not 3 8 coming out the other end okay. So make sure you're buying the right product for you. Now you can buy all these with angles as well this one is a 100 solder. And again it has the 3 8. Now here's where this is different this is a mini ball valve. And it's a quarter turn that's currently closed you see the little ball. And now the ball is open there is no gasket inside of this one okay. Now when you're using this without a gasket. And you want to do your soldering no problem you stick it on your pipe you scratch it up you put some flux you solder your joint nothing special you don't have to do any extra work okay there's nothing in here that's going to get destroyed. But if you're going to solder with this kind of gasket the first thing you got to do,https://youtu.be/hg5GlGOo-j0?t=0,"['What is the primary cause of water dripping around a toilet?', 'How does a 90-degree angle shutoff valve differ from a straight valve?', 'What are the different materials used to make shutoff valves for plumbing connections?', 'Why is it important to read the package instructions when purchasing a shut off valve?', 'What type of joint is used in a mini ball valve with no gasket?']"

And that's going to require a couple of wrenches okay. And you take off this. And it all unthreads. And there's the gasket if you try soldering while that gasket's installed it'll melt. And your toilet will forever drip all right. Now let's just leave that open there let's take a look at this one as well see if it's exactly the same there we go again look at the difference there it's the same kind of gasket it's just a different intakes. But this one shows really well if you want to see what's going on here i'll just open this handle take the set,https://youtu.be/hg5GlGOo-j0?t=239,"['What type of wrenches are required to remove a gasket?', 'What happens when soldering is attempted while the gasket is installed?', 'Why does soldering melt when done with an installed gasket?', 'How can a toilet drip forever if soldering melts the gasket?', 'What is the purpose of opening the handle on one of the gaskets?']"

Now that's got a threaded ring on it for the handle. And if your toilet has a broken handle or has an old tin. And it's all rusted. And sharp use pliers to take it off you can go to the hardware store. And buy just a handle. And they're replacement parts all right. And they work great you want to have a handle that you can actually use in case of emergency all right trust me you don't want an old sharp metal piece of tin sitting there because if your toilet cracks. And water starts to leak you want to be able to shut that off in a heartbeat. Now watch this this kind of valve has two gaskets when you put this in all right this gasket keeps the water from leaking at this point okay. And the gasket inside keeps water from traveling through the pipe in the closed position. But in the open position is where it usually sits all right. And when it's open like that the only when it's open inside inside the pipe okay this one's being used all the time. And this one isn't all right. So what happens is after a long time you'll go. And you'll go to close your valve. And you're going to do some repairs. And you'll find that the gasket isn't working anymore. And so even when you got the shut off all the way on you're going to have water kind of dripping up. And dripping out okay it'll drive you crazy.

And shut off the the main supply to the house or you can actually go out. And buy a 3 8 od brass cap okay. So you can take your your water supply off. And you can actually teflon tape or use a little paste. And you can put a cap right on there. Now if you have got an old shutoff valve. And it's leaking all right. And it's soldered in. And it's leaking from the handle or when you when you when you've when you've turned it off. And you've replaced your hose it's still leaking you turn the water supply off you don't have to go to the store. And buy a shutoff valve. And then re-solder it all you do is you buy the shutoff valve you take the handle assembly out. And you swap it into the old valve they still are the same size okay that'll save your bacon because if you've got an old solder soldered line all you got to do is just replace the handle assembly. And they're they're like almost 100 universal that'll save you a ton of time. And aggravation. And you don't need to worry about if you have soldering skills all right.

So you can just change the interior part of the valve here we go like i said. So with this kind there's no gaskets with this kind there are gaskets. And you can actually go to the store. And you can buy replacement gaskets okay. And they just stick right on there that's an option as well once you've got the handle off this gasket can also be replaced all right there's lots of options one of the coolest things about plumbing is that everything is got the ability to have maintenance like these pieces of solid brass will last a thousand years they're not going anywhere it's the gaskets. And the handles that are the problem that's the weak spot in the whole fitting as long as you understand that if you run into trouble you're good to go renovation tip your plumbing is coming out of a wall let's say right. And you've gutted your bathroom. And you want to keep that plumbing intact because let's say it's a it's a it's a soldered system like this one okay. So i got plumbing sticking out of the wall i ripped all the drywall off. And now i want to put new drywall back on again well. Now you need this huge hole right. But if you turn off the water take your wrench to it. And take out this handle assembly with the washer. Now your hole is only this wide. And if you cut the hole in the drywall that round you can slide it right over top of an existing fitting. And then afterwards okay you they have a  it's called a split pipe flange all right. And it's a little piece of metal tin. And you buy it. And you just twist it open. And you snap it around your pipe afterwards to cover your hole all right that'll save your bacon as well. And the most common leak in a toilet is actually around the gasket because most people don't install the toilet properly all right. So if you have dirty water coming through the ceiling downstairs that's when you know your gas is leaking. But if you have water on the floor chances are it's not the gasket because the gasket not installed properly usually causes water to go through the floor if you have water around your toilet there's a couple places needed to check first check right here where this is make sure that this washer is working okay check the connection on your pec,https://youtu.be/hg5GlGOo-j0?t=442,"['What type of plumbing requires soldering skills?', 'Can replacement gaskets be purchased at most stores?', 'How long can solid brass fittings last?', 'What is a split pipe flange used for?', 'Why does the toilet gasket often cause water to leak through the floor?']"

And all you do is just take a paper towel. And wipe it off give it 30 seconds. And just touch it again. And see if it gets wet all right check your connection here because these flexible hoses also have gaskets. And gaskets can run into trouble over time a lot of people have a tendency when they're putting on their gaskets they over tighten okay go hand tight. And then just gentle pressure okay. And as long as the gasket is engaged with the metal it works as soon as you start over tightening it starts breaking down prematurely next thing you want to check is the toilet tank to the bowl there are two bolts there okay. And there are plenty of occasions where that sits nice. And everything's working fine. And then one day somebody will just sit down. And lean too hard on the tank. And kind of twist things up a little bit. And break the seal. And you might need to stick a big screwdriver in the tank. And tighten those connections up again as well all right. Now you might also have a problem like i did i bought a toilet. And it was shipped here it was on internet purchase. And when the toilet got here the tank had a hairline crack in it right that's crazy. But this is what happened. So we actually repaired it with some waterproofing tape just because we're too busy. And one of these days we'll get around to replacing that toilet. But for the meantime the waterproofing tape work great. And if you find yourself in a situation where your toilet's got a leak in the tank or the bowl. And you want it just a temporary fix you can do just like i did. And use the waterproofing tape the stuff actually worked amazing we used it inside. And outside the tank. And then filled it back up again it's been like that for a year no issues. Now listen there's a lot of information out there. And a lot of different products that you've probably never used before if you're not you know if you haven't done a major renovation before.

And you've got a roughed-in bathroom downstairs which basically means they've given you about a 5 by 7 space plumbing sticking out of the concrete for the toilet. And for your shower. And you're trying to figure out is this a project that you can handle renovating on your own. And finishing it off the answer is yes.

So first of all let's talk about the the roughen procedure because whenever you're building something you need to have a roughen plumbing rough-in electrical rough in framing. And you need to pass your inspections for all of these different stages. So generally when you get your home you're gonna have the plumbing roughed in as far as a waste. And the vent is concerned. But not for the water supply. So when you take on a project like this you're gonna want to get a permit you're gonna want to get your city or municipality or state or an inspector in your home to make sure you've done things right.

And how to do all these different tasks we have all those videos let's throw some links in the descriptions. So that you can follow along. But what we're doing today is talking the generalities okay. So generally you've got plumbing. Now one of the first things everyone says is well i guess i got to open up the concrete the toilet isn't exactly the right spot maybe the shower isn't exactly in the right spot. And there are ways that you can work around this problem they make aftermarket products for the toilets where you can just cut the pipe off at the concrete. And you can insert your flange. And then screw that flange to the concrete. So you don't have to open the floor up they also have an awesome product from the schluter company that's designed for showers. So this this is the the drain rough-in okay. And generally it's a pipe sticking out of the ground. Now if you're gonna put in a tub shower or a shower pan in this kind of environment what you're gonna find out is that that pipe is never in the right spot they don't care it's a roughen. So they don't even have a wall to consider right at this point. So what you can do is schluter sells a flange with a 90 degree i mean attachment okay. Now you can just cut the pipe half an inch off the concrete stick on an elbow fitting. And now you can locate your drain anywhere in the shower that you want to that means you're going to be doing a custom shower. But think of this from if you don't have to open the concrete. And do a go through all that time. And your investment there. And you can just plug. And play something like this. And you can make a custom shower anywhere in the house you want which is awesome i would also recommend going to the 4-foot shower don't go the full five okay that gives you lots of room. And flexibility for all your water supply. And you can future considerations having room to add a niche in your wall all right hmm remember bathrooms in the basement in a lot of cases are full of all kinds of mechanical they everywhere. So by making the shower smaller smaller by making the showers smaller than the room it gives you a little bit of flexibility. Now other things to consider is the height up in the ceiling generally you're full of ductwork if you have a basement you've got a heating system. And so there pipes running everywhere. And in modern construction we're using hrv the heat recovery ventilation system. So there's extra ducting. So when you look up when your ceiling you're like wow where am i going to possibly put a light consider using the new slimline leds you can put them just about anywhere. And if you can drill a hole you can get that little boxes attached to your light.

But that might be a worst-case scenario. So when it comes to doing your roughened plumbing you can go with pex okay as a homeowner it's real easy to work with the tools are very cost effective. And it doesn't require a great deal of skill all you got to do is kind of really the right length. And crimp it all together. So you can set up your shower. And that's good make sure when you're framing your shower you have extra wood on the inside of the walls. So that when you're putting in your shower door system you have something to screw it to that's a consideration you don't want to have the realization afterwards try to attach a door to just your tile because that can be a disaster the other thing you want to do is if you're using the shooter system you're going to be getting a kerb because is raised floor okay this is awesome you get this involved right at the very beginning it helps you square your framing off you also have to make sure that you got all your electrical figured out because they're not gonna rough in the wiring for a basement bathroom. So that means almost everybody has the same rules you're gonna have to pull an electrical permit it's a different inspector than the building up permit you're going to want to run power to a plug for your sink. And that's gonna be a gfi. And from there you can put in light switches. And lights. And not have to be concerned about you know proximity to water locations most electrical codes in the world allow you to have a gfi supplying all the power in a bathroom. And then all the switches. And fixtures can be in the bathroom. And everything is safe. So that's just one circuit for the bathroom. And you're good to go. So let's go through this we've got the waste it's,https://youtu.be/JK6esDuKPMQ?t=230,"['What type of plumbing material is recommended for a homeowner to use when doing roughened plumbing?', 'Why is it important to have extra wood on the inside of the walls when framing a shower?', 'What is the purpose of a kerb in a shooter system and how does it help with framing?', 'Are there any specific electrical codes that need to be followed when installing electrical components in a bathroom?', 'Can all electrical fixtures and switches be installed in the same circuit as the GFI power supply for a bathroom?']"

And you're good to go. So let's go through this we've got the waste it's already installed the venting is already installed the power supply one single circuit really easy to hook up. And we have videos that will show you how to do that as well we have lights. So you can add pot lights in the room if you're gonna put in a vanity strip most building code allows you to just bring the wire you don't need a box. And this is a mistake a lot of people make if you put an octagon box on the wall. And you mount your vanity light onto it you'll find that the box plate on the vanity light it's actually narrower than the electrical box itself in the wall you've got an ugly hole. So what they do is they allow you to run the wire through the back of that plate with a grommet. And you can just mount it on the surface anywhere that you like. So it's very convenient to put that assembly along with the mirror stuck on the wall. And you're good to go. Now in most cases a 5 by 7 bathroom you're looking for a 24 inch vanity nothing too crazy maybe a 30. And if you buy a 24. And you want to get a little more counter space just pull it off the wall until it's too comfortable position by the toilet remember a toilet you want about 15 inches on each side center of the pipe. So you're not going to be cramped. And you can be confident your toilet will fit when you're all done. And then for flooring piece of cake right we have luxury vinyl tile you can install luxury vinyl direct on concrete. And listen some manufacturers have a solid core on the back of it. And some as a soft or a cork. So depending on your product you might need an underlay if you need the underlay use it you don't want to have that crunchy sound when you're walking on the floor. And there are three other major considerations i want you to consider if where you start closing up your bathroom because there's usually mechanical things that are done in a ceiling in a bathroom that the builders are getting away with we'll call it like for instance right here they clean up all right this pipe here is actually the waste pipe for the island sink in the kitchen. And they have to have a clean-out every 12 feet. So that's where they put it right here in the ceiling of the basement bathroom if you ever finish this bathroom really is that where you want this that's just in really bad location. So you're gonna want to interrupt take this piece. And put it on the other side of the wall just a few feet away or leave it alone. And just add another one that way you can satisfy the building coat that you have a clean note. And but you can actually access one a few feet down the road over here. So this little wire hang in here is a telltale sign you've got a central vac rough into this corner again it's in the bathroom because it's officially unfinished space even though they've roughed it in with the intention of finishing it it's my biggest pet peeve i wish builders would move stuff out of the bathroom. And into the mechanical room. But here we go. So you got a wire stick in here. And then up in the ceiling. So that that's the stub out for my central vac that's run through the entire house i've got to get a coupling. And another piece of pipe to extend that over to the mechanical room before i close the ceiling up or no one is ever gonna find it again this wire is too short it's a simple cat five tie these wires together color-coded okay run that over to where it's going to be useful to you hi the only other thing that we had in this bathroom that was unique is they actually had the shutoff valve for the tap outside in the ceiling in the bathroom underneath all the floor joists i don't know how that passed. But i ended up cutting that out. And moving it over to the mechanical room it doesn't really matter how far away you are from the tap as long as you can turn it off. And has a bleeder valve you can let water in the line out. Then you won't have any freezing in your faucet. Now i know this is a quick little video. But the reality is if you have a house with an unfinished basement bathroom rough-in area. And you want to finish yourself at something you can do on your own trust me the process for cutting this down. And building it isn't that tricky especially if you using really basic products like we're discussing today. So all of this information is going to be found in this place right here it's a complete do yourself bathroom with a vinyl floor. And a custom shower. And if you watch that. And put that in your basement you can finish your own basement too. And make your house worth thousands of dollars more than it is today thanks for joining us see you soon,https://youtu.be/JK6esDuKPMQ?t=315,"['What type of electrical box is recommended for installing vanity lights?', 'How much counter space is typically needed for a 5x7 bathroom?', 'Why do some manufacturers require an underlay for luxury vinyl tile flooring?', 'What are the three major considerations when closing up an unfinished basement bathroom?', 'Why is it important to access and maintain mechanical components in a bathroom?']"
